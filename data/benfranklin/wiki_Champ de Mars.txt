The '''Champ de Mars''' ({{IPA-fr|ʃɑ̃ də maʁs}} ; {{lang-en|'''Field of Mars'''}}) is a large public [[Urban open space|greenspace]] in [[Paris]], [[France]], located in the [[7ème arrondissement, Paris|seventh ''arrondissement'']], between the [[Eiffel Tower]] to the northwest and the [[École Militaire]] to the southeast. The park is named after the [[Campus Martius]] ("Mars Field") in [[Rome]], a tribute to the [[Mars (mythology)|Latin name of the Roman God of war]]. The name also alludes to the fact that the lawns here were formerly used as drilling and marching grounds by the French military.

==History==
Originally, the Champ de Mars was part of a large flat open area called [[Grenelle]], which was reserved for [[market garden]]ing. Citizens would claim small plots and exploit them by growing fruits, vegetables, and flowers for the local market. However, the plain of Grenelle was not an especially fertile place for farming.

The construction, in 1765, of the ''[[École Militaire]]'' designed by [[Ange-Jacques Gabriel]], was the first step toward the Champ de Mars in its present form. Grounds for military drills were originally planned for an area south of the school, the current location of the ''[[place de Fontenoy]]''. The choice to build an esplanade to the north of the school led to the erection of the noble facade which today encloses the Champ de Mars. The planners leveled the ground, surrounded it with a large ditch and a long avenue of elms, and, as a final touch, the esplanade was enclosed by a fine grille-work fence.

The [[Île des Cygnes (former island)|Isle of Swans]], formerly a [[riverine]] islet at the location of the northeastern foot of the [[Eiffel Tower]], was, for the sake of symmetry and pleasing perspectives, attached to the shore. (Note that the Isle of Swans discussed here should not be confused with the [[Île aux Cygnes|Isle of Swans]] that sits in the middle of the [[River Seine|Seine]] downstream and around the next bend in the river, between the [[15ème arrondissement, Paris|fifteenth]] and [[16ème arrondissement, Paris|sixteenth arrondissements]].)

[[Jacques Charles]] and the [[Robert brothers]] launched the world's [[Robert brothers#First hydrogen balloon|first hydrogen-filled balloon]] from the Champ-de-Mars on 27 August 1783.<ref>[http://www.scienceandsociety.co.uk/results.asp?image=10447673 ''Medal commemorating Charles and Robert’s balloon ascent, Paris, 1783''] from [http://www.scienceandsociety.co.uk/help.asp#p1 Science and Society], 2010.</ref>

This place witnessed the spectacle and pageantry of some of the best-remembered festivals of the [[French Revolution]]. On 14 July 1790 the first "Federation Day" celebration (''fête de la Fédération''), now known as [[Bastille Day]], was held on the Champ de Mars, exactly one year after the storming of the prison. The following year, on 17 July 1791, the [[Champ de Mars Massacre|massacre on the Champ de Mars]] took place. [[Jean Sylvain Bailly]], the first mayor of Paris, became a victim of his own revolution and was guillotined there on 12 November 1793.

The Champ de Mars was also the site of the [[Cult of the Supreme Being|Festival of the Supreme Being]] on 8 June 1794. With a design by the painter [[Jacques-Louis David]],<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=6_2wkP4j-EsC&lpg=PR1&pg=PR1#v=onepage&q&f=false ''Encyclopedia of the age of political revolutions and new ideologies: 1760 - 1815''], Gregory Fremont-Barnes; Greenwood Press, CT, 2007; [https://books.google.com/books?id=6_2wkP4j-EsC&lpg=PR1&pg=PA237#v=onepage&q&f=false p.237]</ref> a massive "Altar of the Nation" was built atop an artificial mountain and surmounted by a [[arbre de la liberté|tree of liberty]].<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=QhyjQgAACAAJ&dq=A+Cultural+History+of+the+French+Revolution&hl=en&ei=k3NOTJ2qEIP98Abx1q31BQ&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1&ved=0CC0Q6AEwAA ''A Cultural History of the French Revolution''], Emmet Kennedy; Yale Univ.
