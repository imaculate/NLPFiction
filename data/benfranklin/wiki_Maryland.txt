The state's largest city is [[Baltimore]], and its capital is [[Annapolis, Maryland|Annapolis]]. Among its occasional nicknames are ''[[Maryland 400|Old Line State]]'', the ''Free State'', and the ''[[Chesapeake Bay]] State''. It is named after the English queen [[Henrietta Maria of France|Henrietta Maria]], known in England as Queen Mary.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mdarchives.state.md.us/msa/mdmanual/01glance/html/name.html |title=Maryland's Name |accessdate=July 20, 2012 |website=Catholic History of Maryland|publisher=Simon & Schuster}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ghostsofbaltimore.org/2015/05/19/why-is-it-named-maryland/|title=Why Is It Named Maryland? - Ghosts of Baltimore|website=ghostsofbaltimore.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-02-19|date=2015-05-19}}</ref>

Sixteen of Maryland's twenty-three counties border the tidal waters of the [[Chesapeake Bay|Chesapeake Bay estuary]] and its many tributaries, which combined total more than 4,000 miles of shoreline. Although one of the smallest states in the U.S., it features a variety of climates and topographical features that have earned it the moniker of ''America in Miniature''. In a similar vein, Maryland's geography, culture, and history combines elements of the [[Mid-Atlantic (United States)|Mid-Atlantic]], [[Northeastern United States|Northeastern]], and [[South Atlantic United States|South Atlantic]] regions of the country.

One of the original [[Thirteen Colonies]] of Great Britain, Maryland was founded by [[George Calvert]], a Catholic convert<ref name="Cecilius Calvert 2010">"George Calvert and Cecilius Calvert, Barons Baltimore" William Hand Browne, Nabu Press (August 1, 2010), {{ISBN|117662539X}} {{ISBN|978-1176625396}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|title=English and Catholic : the Lords Baltimore in the seventeenth century|last=1940-|first=Krugler, John D.|date=2004|publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press|isbn=978-0801879630|location=Baltimore|oclc=53967315}}</ref> who sought to provide a religious haven for Catholics persecuted in England.<ref name=":1">{{Cite book|title=History of Maryland: Province and State|last=Andrews|first=Matthew Page|publisher=Doubleday, Doran & Company, Inc|year=1929|isbn=|location=Garden City, New York|pages=3–5}}</ref> In 1632, [[Charles I of England]] granted Calvert a [[colonial charter]], naming the colony after his wife, Queen Mary.<ref name=":2">{{Cite web|url=http://avalon.law.yale.edu/17th_century/ma01.asp|title=The Charter of Maryland : 1632|date=1998-12-18|website=avalon.law.yale.edu|access-date=2018-05-02}}</ref> Unlike the Pilgrims and Puritans, who enforced religious conformity in their settlements, Calvert envisioned a colony where people of different religious sects would coexist under the principle of [[toleration]].<ref name=":1" /> Accordingly, in 1649 the Maryland General Assembly passed an [[Maryland Toleration Act|Act Concerning Religion]], which enshrined this principle by penalizing anyone who "reproached" a fellow Marylander based on religious affiliation.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://avalon.law.yale.edu/18th_century/maryland_toleration.asp|title=Avalon Project - Maryland Toleration Act; September 21, 1649|website=avalon.law.yale.edu|access-date=2018-05-03}}</ref> Nevertheless, religious strife was common in the early years, and Catholics remained a minority, albeit in greater numbers than in any other English colony.

Maryland's early settlements and population centers clustered around rivers and other waterways that empty into the Chesapeake Bay. Its economy was heavily [[Plantation economy|plantation-based]], centered mostly on the cultivation of tobacco. The need for cheap labor led to a rapid expansion of indentured servants, penal labor, and African slaves. In 1760, Maryland's current boundaries took form following the [[Mason-Dixon Line|settlement]] of a long-running border dispute with Pennsylvania. Maryland was an active participant in the events leading up to the [[American Revolution]], and by 1776 its delegates signed the [[Declaration of Independence (U.S.)|Declaration of Independence]]. Many of its citizens subsequently played [[Maryland in the American Revolution|key political and military roles in the war]]. In 1790, the state ceded land for the establishment of the U.S. capital of [[Washington, D.C.]]

Although a [[Slave states and free states|slave state]], Maryland [[Border states (American Civil War)|remained in the Union]] during the [[U.S. Civil War]], its strategic location giving it [[Maryland in the American Civil War|a significant role in the conflict]]. After the war, Maryland took part in the [[Industrial Revolution]], driven by its seaports, railroad networks, and mass immigration from Europe. Since the Second World War, the state's population has grown rapidly, to approximately six million residents, and it is among the most densely populated states in the nation. {{as of|2015}}, Maryland had the [[List of U.S. states by income|highest median household income]] of any state, owing in large part to its close proximity to [[Washington, D.C.]] and a highly diversified economy spanning manufacturing, services, higher education, and biotechnology.<ref>{{cite web

===Description===
{{Refimprove section|date=July 2018}}
Maryland possesses a variety of [[topography]] within its borders, contributing to its nickname ''America in Miniature''. It ranges from sandy [[dunes]] dotted with seagrass in the east, to low marshlands teeming with wildlife and large [[Taxodium|bald cypress]] near the Chesapeake Bay, to gently rolling hills of oak forests in the [[Piedmont (United States)|Piedmont Region]], and [[pine]] groves in the [[List of mountains in Maryland|Maryland mountains]] to the west.

[[File:Deep Creek Lake Maryland Panoramic View.jpg|upright=1.15|thumb|right|Western Maryland: known for its heavily forested mountains. A panoramic view of [[Deep Creek Lake]] and the surrounding [[Appalachian Mountains]] in [[Garrett County, Maryland|Garrett County]].]]
[[File:Great Falls, Maryland, cliffs.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|[[Great Falls (Potomac River)|Great Falls]] on the [[Potomac River]].]]

Maryland is bounded on its north by [[Pennsylvania]], on its west by [[West Virginia]], on its east by [[Delaware]] and the [[Atlantic Ocean]], and on its south, across the [[Potomac River]], by West Virginia and [[Virginia]]. The mid-portion of this border is interrupted by [[District of Columbia]], which sits on land that was originally part of [[Montgomery County, Maryland|Montgomery]] and [[Prince George's County, Maryland|Prince George's]] counties and including the town of [[Georgetown, D.C.|Georgetown, Maryland]]. This land was ceded to the United States Federal Government in 1790 to form the [[Washington, D.C.|District of Columbia]]. (The [[Virginia|Commonwealth of Virginia]] gave land south of the Potomac, including the town of [[Alexandria, Virginia]], however Virginia retroceded its portion in 1846). The [[Chesapeake Bay]] nearly bisects the state and the counties east of the bay are known collectively as the ''[[Eastern Shore of Maryland|Eastern Shore]]''.
[[File:Patapsco fg01.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|Typical freshwater river above the tidal zone. The [[Patapsco River]] includes the famous [[Thomas Viaduct]] and is part of the [[Patapsco Valley State Park]]. Later, the river forms the [[Inner Harbor]] as it empties into the [[Chesapeake Bay]].]]

[[File:ChesapeakeTidalWetlands.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|Tidal wetlands of the [[Chesapeake Bay]], the largest [[estuary]] in the United States and the largest water feature in Maryland.]]
Most of the state's waterways are part of the Chesapeake Bay watershed, with the exceptions of a tiny portion of extreme western [[Garrett County, Maryland|Garrett County]] (drained by the [[Youghiogheny River]] as part of the watershed of the [[Mississippi River]]), the eastern half of Worcester County (which drains into Maryland's Atlantic coastal bays), and a small portion of the state's northeast corner (which drains into the [[Delaware River]] watershed). So prominent is the Chesapeake in Maryland's geography and economic life that there has been periodic agitation to change the state's official nickname to the "Bay State", a nickname that has been used by [[Massachusetts]] for decades.

The highest point in Maryland, with an elevation of {{convert|3360|ft|m}}, is [[Backbone Mountain|Hoye Crest on Backbone Mountain]], in the southwest corner of [[Garrett County, Maryland|Garrett County]], near the border with West Virginia, and near the headwaters of the North Branch of the Potomac River. Close to the small town of [[Hancock, Maryland|Hancock]], in western Maryland, about two-thirds of the way across the state, there are {{convert|1.83|mi|km|2}} between its borders. This geographical curiosity makes Maryland the narrowest state,{{citation needed|date=November 2012}} bordered by the [[Mason–Dixon line]] to the north, and the northwards-arching [[Potomac River]] to the south.

Portions of Maryland are included in various official and unofficial geographic regions. For example, the [[Delmarva Peninsula]] is composed of the Eastern Shore counties of Maryland, the entire [[state of Delaware]], and the two counties that make up the [[Eastern Shore of Virginia]], whereas the westernmost counties of Maryland are considered part of [[Appalachia]]. Much of the Baltimore–Washington corridor lies just south of the Piedmont in the Coastal Plain,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://dnr.maryland.gov/waters/cbnerr/Documents/publications/CBNERRMD_SiteProfile_Dec2011.pdf |title=Chesapeake Bay National Estuarine Research Reserve in Maryland Site Profile |publisher=Maryland Department of Natural Resources |page=54 |first=Patricia |last=Delgado |access-date=May 21, 2017 |date=December 2011 |quote=Map showing ...

As is typical of states on the [[East Coast of the United States|East Coast]], Maryland's plant life is abundant and healthy. A good dose of annual precipitation helps to support many types of plants, including [[seagrass]] and various [[Phragmites|reeds]] at the smaller end of the spectrum to the gigantic [[Wye Oak]], a huge example of [[white oak]], the state tree, which can grow in excess of {{convert|70|ft|m}} tall.

[[Middle Atlantic coastal forests]], typical of the southeastern [[Atlantic coastal plain]], grow around Chesapeake Bay and on the [[Delmarva Peninsula]]. Moving west, a mixture of [[Northeastern coastal forests]] and [[Southeastern mixed forests]] cover the central part of the state. The [[Appalachian Mountains]] of western Maryland are home to [[Appalachian-Blue Ridge forests]].

 |quote=Historically bobcats were distributed statewide but during the post colonization period densities began to plummet. By the mid-1900s, populations had probably reached all-time lows, with remnant populations existing only in western Maryland. This prompted the Department of Natural Resources (DNR) to classify them as a state-listed "Species of Special Concern." During the past quarter century, occupied range and densities have increased markedly. Results from the annual Bowhunter Survey and the Hunter Mail survey have identified bobcat sightings in 14 of Maryland's 23 counties. Currently, bobcats have dual legal classification in Maryland.

 |accessdate=September 16, 2011
 |quote=Coyotes were historically a western species with core populations found west of the Mississippi River. Alterations and/or elimination of competing predators during the post-European colonization period facilitated rapid range expansion into eastern North America during the 20th Century. Established populations now occur in every state and province in North America. Coyotes are a relatively new addition to local ecosystems, and were first documented in Maryland during 1972. Initial substantiated sightings occurred in Cecil, Frederick and Washington counties. Since that time population densities and occupied range have expanded incrementally and coyotes now occur statewide.

===Climate===
[[File:Maryland Köppen.svg|thumb|A map of Köppen climate types in Maryland]]
[[File:Baltimore_Snowpocalypse.jpg|thumb|Winter in Baltimore, Lancaster Street, Fells Point]]
Maryland has a wide array of climates, due to local variances in elevation, proximity to water, and protection from colder weather due to [[Katabatic wind|downslope wind]]s.

The eastern half of Maryland—which includes the cities of [[Ocean City, Maryland|Ocean City]], [[Salisbury, Maryland|Salisbury]], [[Annapolis]], and the southern and eastern suburbs of Washington, D.C. and [[Baltimore]]—lies on the [[Atlantic Coastal Plain]], with flat topography and sandy or muddy soil. This region has a [[humid subtropical climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]] ''Cfa''), with hot, humid summers and a short, mild to cool winter; it falls under USDA [[Hardiness zone]] 8a.<ref name = "Arbor Day Foundation">{{cite web|url=http://www.arborday.org/media/zones.cfm |title=Hardiness Zones |publisher=Arbor Day Foundation |accessdate=March 5, 2013}}</ref>

The [[Piedmont (United States)|Piedmont]] region—which includes northern and western greater Baltimore, [[Westminster, Maryland|Westminster]], [[Gaithersburg, Maryland|Gaithersburg]], [[Frederick, Maryland|Frederick]], and [[Hagerstown, Maryland|Hagerstown]]—has average seasonal snowfall totals generally exceeding {{convert|20|in|cm}} and, as part of USDA Hardiness zones 7b and 7a,<ref name = "Arbor Day Foundation"/> temperatures below {{convert|10|°F|0}} are less rare. From the [[Cumberland Valley]] on westward, the climate begins to transition to a [[humid continental climate]] (Köppen ''Dfa'').

In western Maryland, the higher elevations of [[Allegany County, Maryland|Allegany]] and [[Garrett County, Maryland|Garrett]] counties—including the cities of [[Cumberland, Maryland|Cumberland]], [[Frostburg, Maryland|Frostburg]], and [[Oakland, Maryland|Oakland]]—display more characteristics of the humid continental zone, due in part to elevation. They fall under USDA Hardiness zones 6b and below.<ref name = "Arbor Day Foundation"/>

Precipitation in the state is characteristic of the East Coast. Annual rainfall ranges from {{convert|35|to|45|in|mm}} with more in higher elevations. Nearly every part of Maryland receives {{convert|3.5|–|4.5|in|mm}} per month of rain. Average annual snowfall varies from {{convert|9|in|cm}} in the coastal areas to over {{convert|100|in|cm}} in the western mountains of the state.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.erh.noaa.gov/er/lwx/Historic_Events/md-snow-avg.gif |title=Snowfall Map |accessdate=October 24, 2010}}</ref>

Because of its location near the [[East Coast of the United States|Atlantic Coast]], Maryland is somewhat vulnerable to [[tropical cyclones]], although the [[Delmarva Peninsula]] and the outer banks of [[North Carolina]] provide a large buffer, such that strikes from major hurricanes (category 3 or above) occur infrequently. More often, Maryland gets the remnants of a tropical system which has already come ashore and released most of its energy. Maryland averages around 30–40 days of thunderstorms a year, and averages around six tornado strikes annually.<ref name="Annual average number of tornadoes">[http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/img/climate/research/tornado/small/avgt5304.gif] NOAA National Climatic Data Center.

===17th century===

====Maryland's first colonial settlement====
{{Main|Province of Maryland}}

[[George Calvert, 1st Lord Baltimore]] (1579–1632), sought a charter from King [[Charles I of England|Charles I]] for the territory between [[Massachusetts]] to the north and [[Virginia]] to the immediate south.<ref name="Stewart 1967 42–43">{{Cite book|last=Stewart

After the first Lord Baltimore died in April 1632, the charter was granted to his son, [[Cecilius Calvert, 2nd Baron Baltimore]] (1605–1675), on June 20, 1632. Officially, the new "Maryland Colony" was named in honor of [[Henrietta Maria of France]], wife of Charles I of England.  George Calvert initially proposed the name “Crescentia,” the land of growth or increase, but “the King proposed Terra Mariae [Mary Land], which was concluded on and Inserted in the bill.”<ref name=":1" />

The original capital of Maryland was [[St. Mary's City, Maryland|St. Mary's City]], on the north shore of the [[Potomac River]], and the county surrounding it, the first erected/created in the province,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://msa.maryland.gov/msa/speccol/photos/lowe/html/sm_2.html|title=Maryland In Focus -- St. Mary's County|first=Kristin P.|last=Masser|website=msa.maryland.gov}}</ref> was first called Augusta Carolina, after the King, and later named St. Mary's County.<ref>{{Cite book|title=History of Maryland at 32|last=|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=}}</ref>

Lord Baltimore's first settlers arrived in the new colony in March 1634, with his younger brother [[Leonard Calvert]] (1606–1647), as first provincial [[Governor of Maryland]]. They made their first permanent settlement at [[St. Mary's City, Maryland|St. Mary's City]] in what is now [[St. Mary's County]]. They purchased the site from the [[paramount chief]] of the region, who was eager to establish trade. St. Mary's became the first [[state capital|capital]] of Maryland, and remained so for 60 years until 1695. More settlers soon followed. Their tobacco crops were successful and quickly made the new colony profitable. However, given the incidence of [[malaria]], [[yellow fever]] and [[typhoid]], life expectancy in Maryland was about 10 years less than in [[New England]].<ref name=iha>[http://www.ushistory.org/us/5a.asp "The Southern Colonies", U.S. History, The Independence Hall Association] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160322155310/http://www.ushistory.org/us/5a.asp |date=March 22, 2016 }}</ref>

In 1642 a number of [[Puritan]]s left Virginia for Maryland and founded Providence (now called [[Annapolis, Maryland|Annapolis]]) on the [[Western Shore of Maryland|western shore]] of the upper [[Chesapeake Bay]].<ref>Taylor, Owen M.,''History of Annapolis'' (1872) [https://books.google.com/books?id=Vr9ib-I1WlIC p 5 online]</ref> A dispute with traders from Virginia over [[Kent Island]] in the Chesapeake led to armed conflict.

''Merchants and Revolution'' London:Verso. 2003, {{ISBN|1-85984-333-6}}</ref> Both used religion as a tool to gain popular support. The two years from 1644–1646 that Claiborne and his Puritan associates held sway were known as "The Plundering Time". They captured Jesuit priests, imprisoned them, then sent them back to England.

In 1646 [[Leonard Calvert]] returned with troops, recaptured St. Mary's City, and restored order. The House of Delegates passed the "Act concerning Religion" in 1649 granting religious liberty to all Trinitarian Christians.<ref name=iha/>

In 1650 the Puritans revolted against the proprietary government. "Protestants swept the Catholics out of the legislature ...and religious strife returned".<ref name=iha/>
The Puritans set up a new government prohibiting both [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholicism]] and [[Church of England|Anglicanism]]. The Puritan revolutionary government persecuted Maryland Catholics during its reign, known as the "plundering time". Mobs burned down all the original Catholic churches of southern Maryland. The Puritan rule lasted until 1658 when the Calvert family and Lord Baltimore regained proprietary control and re-enacted the Toleration Act.

After England's "[[Glorious Revolution]]" of 1688, Maryland outlawed Catholicism. In 1704, the Maryland General Assembly prohibited Catholics from operating schools, limited the corporate ownership of property to hamper religious orders from expanding or supporting themselves, and encouraged the conversion of Catholic children.<ref name=":0" /> The celebration of the Catholic sacraments was also officially restricted. This state of affairs lasted until after the [[American Revolutionary War]] (1775–1783). Wealthy Catholic planters built chapels on their land to practice their religion in relative secrecy.

Into the 18th century, individual priests and lay leaders claimed Maryland farms belonging to the Jesuits as personal property and bequeathed these and other properties to other religious or lay people in order to evade the legal restrictions on religious organizations&nbsp;– such as the Society of Jesus&nbsp;– owning property.<ref name=":0" />

===Border disputes (1681–1760)===
{{main|Penn–Calvert Boundary Dispute|Cresap's War}}

The royal charter granted Maryland the land north of the [[Potomac River]] up to the [[40th parallel north|40th parallel]]. A problem arose when [[Charles II of England|Charles II]] granted a charter for [[Pennsylvania]]. The grant defined Pennsylvania's southern border as identical to Maryland's northern border, the 40th parallel. But the grant indicated that Charles II and [[William Penn]] assumed the 40th parallel would pass close to [[New Castle, Delaware]] when it falls north of [[Philadelphia]], the site of which Penn had already selected for his colony's capital city. Negotiations ensued after the problem was discovered in 1681.

A compromise proposed by Charles II in 1682 was undermined by Penn's receiving the additional grant of what is now Delaware.<ref name=hubbard>{{Cite book|last= Hubbard |first= Bill, Jr. |title= American Boundaries: the Nation, the States, the Rectangular Survey |year= 2009 |publisher= University of Chicago Press |isbn= 978-0-226-35591-7 |pages= 21–23}}</ref> Penn successfully argued that the Maryland charter entitled Lord Baltimore only to unsettled lands, and Dutch settlement in Delaware predated his charter. The dispute remained unresolved for nearly a century, carried on by the descendants of William Penn and Lord Baltimore&nbsp;— the [[Baron Baltimore|Calvert family]], which controlled Maryland, and the [[William Penn|Penn family]], which controlled Pennsylvania.<ref name=hubbard/>

The border dispute with Pennsylvania led to Cresap's War in the 1730s. Hostilities erupted in 1730 and escalated through the first half of the decade, culminating in the deployment of military forces by Maryland in 1736 and by Pennsylvania in 1737. The armed phase of the conflict ended in May 1738 with the intervention of King George II, who compelled the negotiation of a cease-fire. A provisional agreement had been established in 1732.<ref name=hubbard/>

Negotiations continued until a final agreement was signed in 1760. The agreement defined the border between Maryland and Pennsylvania as the line of latitude now known as the [[Mason–Dixon line]]. Maryland's border with Delaware was based on a [[Transpeninsular Line]] and the [[Twelve-Mile Circle]] around New Castle.<ref name=hubbard/>

Most of the English colonists arrived in Maryland as [[indentured servant]]s, and had to serve a several years' term as laborers to pay for their passage.<ref>"[http://www.folger.edu/html/folger_institute/jamestown/c_shifflet.htm Indentured Servants and the Pursuits of Happiness] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100104180311/http://www.folger.edu/html/folger_institute/jamestown/c_shifflet.htm |date=January 4, 2010 }}". Crandall Shifflett, ''Virginia Tech''.</ref> In the early years, the line between indentured servants and African slaves or laborers was fluid, and white and black laborers commonly lived and worked together, and formed unions. [[Mixed-race]] children born to white mothers were considered free by the principle of ''[[partus sequitur ventrem]]'', by which children took the social status of their mothers, a principle of slave law that was adopted throughout the colonies, following Virginia in 1662. During the colonial era, families of [[free people of color]] were formed most often by unions of white women and African men.<ref name="Heinegg"/>

Many of the free black families migrated to Delaware, where land was cheaper.<ref name="Heinegg">[http://www.freeafricanamericans.com/ Paul Heinegg. ''Free African Americans in Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Maryland and Delaware'']. Retrieved February 15, 2008.</ref> As the flow of indentured laborers to the colony decreased with improving economic conditions in England, planters in Maryland imported thousands more slaves and racial caste lines hardened. The economy's growth and prosperity was based on slave labor, devoted first to the production of [[tobacco]] as the commodity crop.

Maryland was one of the [[13 colonies|thirteen colonies]] that revolted against British rule in the [[American Revolution]]. Near the end of the [[American Revolutionary War]] (1775–1783), on February 2, 1781, Maryland became the last and 13th state to approve the ratification of the [[Articles of Confederation|Articles of Confederation and Perpetual Union]], first proposed in 1776 and adopted by the [[Second Continental Congress]] in 1778, which brought into being the United States as a united, [[sovereignty|sovereign]] and [[nation state|national state]]. It also became the seventh state admitted to the Union after ratifying the new federal Constitution in 1788. In December 1790, Maryland donated land selected by first President [[George Washington]] to the federal government for the creation of the new national capital of [[Washington, D.C.]] The land was provided along the north shore of the [[Potomac River]] from [[Montgomery County, Maryland|Montgomery]] and [[Prince George's County, Maryland|Prince George's]] counties, as well as from [[Fairfax County, Virginia|Fairfax County]] and [[Alexandria, Virginia|Alexandria]] on the south shore of the Potomac in [[Virginia]]; however, the land donated by the Commonwealth of Virginia was later returned to that state by the [[District of Columbia retrocession]] in 1846.

Influenced by a changing economy, revolutionary ideals, and preaching by ministers, numerous planters in Maryland freed their slaves in the 20 years after the [[American Revolution|Revolutionary War]]. Across the Upper South the free black population increased from less than 1% before the war to 14% by 1810.<ref name="Kolchin"/> Abolitionist [[Harriet Tubman]] was born a slave during this time in [[Dorchester County, Maryland]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.history.com/topics/black-history/harriet-tubman|title=Harriet Tubman|last=Editors|first=History com|website=HISTORY|language=en|access-date=2019-01-18}}</ref>

During the [[War of 1812]], the British military attempted to capture Baltimore, which was protected by [[Fort McHenry]]. During this bombardment the song "[[Star Spangled Banner]]" was written by [[Francis Scott Key]]; it was later adopted as the national anthem.

Governor [[Thomas Holliday Hicks]] suspended the state legislature, and to help ensure the election of a new pro-union governor and legislature, President [[Abraham Lincoln]] had a number of its pro-slavery politicians arrested, including the Mayor of Baltimore, [[George William Brown]]; suspended several civil liberties, including  ''habeas corpus''; and ordered artillery placed on [[Federal Hill, Baltimore, Maryland|Federal Hill]] overlooking Baltimore. Historians debate the constitutionality of these wartime actions, and the suspension of civil liberties was later deemed illegal by  the [[United States Supreme Court|U.S. Supreme Court]].{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}

Although a tactical draw, the battle was considered a strategic Union victory and a [[turning point of the American Civil War|turning point]] of the war.

====After the war====
A new state constitution in 1864 [[Abolitionism in the United States|abolished]] slavery and Maryland was first recognized as a "Free State" in that context.<ref name=freestate>{{cite web |url=http://msa.maryland.gov/msa/mdmanual/01glance/html/nickname.html |title=Maryland at a Glance: Nicknames |publisher=Maryland State Archives |date=September 29, 2015 |access-date=February 8, 2018 }}</ref> Following passage of constitutional amendments that granted voting rights to [[freedmen]], in 1867 the state extended suffrage to non-white males.

The [[History of the United States Democratic Party|Democratic Party]] rapidly regained power in the state from [[History of the United States Republican Party|Republicans]]. Democrats replaced the Constitution of 1864 with the [[Maryland Constitution of 1867|Constitution of 1867]]. Following the end of Reconstruction in 1877, Democrats devised means of [[Disfranchisement after Reconstruction era|disfranchising]] blacks, initially by physical intimidation and voter fraud, later by constitutional amendments and laws.
Blacks and immigrants, however, resisted Democratic Party disfranchisement efforts in the state. Maryland blacks were part of a biracial Republican coalition elected to state government in 1896–1904 and comprised 20% of the electorate.<ref name="tuck">[http://www.brandonkendhammer.com/democratization_Spring2013/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/Tuck-2007.pdf STEPHEN TUCK, "Democratization and the Disfranchisement of African Americans in the US South during the Late 19th Century" (pdf)], Spring 2013, reading for "Challenges of Democratization", by Brandon Kendhammer, Ohio University</ref>

Compared to some other states, blacks were better established both before and after the civil war. Nearly half the black population was free before the war, and some had accumulated property. Half the population lived in cities. Literacy was high among blacks and, as Democrats crafted means to exclude them, suffrage campaigns helped reach blacks and teach them how to resist.<ref name="tuck"/> Whites did impose [[racial segregation]] in public facilities and [[Jim Crow]] laws, which effectively lasted until passage of federal civil rights legislation in the mid-1960s.

Baltimore grew significantly during the [[Industrial Revolution]], due in large part to its seaport and good railroad connections, attracting European immigrant labor. Many manufacturing businesses were established in the Baltimore area after the Civil War. Baltimore businessmen, including [[Johns Hopkins]], [[Enoch Pratt]], [[George Peabody]], and [[Henry Walters]], founded notable city  institutions that bear their names, including a university, library, music school and art museum.

Cumberland was Maryland's second-largest city in the 19th century. Nearby supplies of natural resources along with railroads fostered its growth into a major manufacturing center.<ref name="WDL">{{cite web |url = http://www.wdl.org/en/item/11374/ |title = Bird's Eye View of Cumberland, Maryland 1906 |website = [[World Digital Library]] |year = 1906 |access-date = July 22, 2013 }}</ref>

===20th and 21st centuries===
{{original research|section|date=May 2014}}

====Early 20th century====
The [[Progressive Era]] of the late 19th and early 20th centuries brought political reforms. In a series of laws passed between 1892 and 1908, reformers worked for standard state-issued ballots (rather than those distributed and marked by the parties); obtained closed voting booths to prevent party workers from "assisting" voters; initiated [[primary election]]s to keep party bosses from selecting candidates; and had candidates listed without party symbols, which discouraged the [[illiterate]] from participating. These measures worked against ill-educated whites and blacks. Blacks resisted such efforts, with suffrage groups conducting voter education.
Blacks defeated three efforts to disfranchise them, making alliances with immigrants to resist various Democratic campaigns.<ref name="tuck"/> Disfranchising bills in 1905, 1907, and 1911 were rebuffed, in large part because of black opposition. Blacks comprised 20% of the electorate and immigrants comprised 15%, and the legislature had difficulty devising requirements against blacks that did not also disadvantage immigrants.<ref name="tuck"/>

The Progressive Era also brought reforms in working conditions for Maryland's labor force. In 1902 the state regulated conditions in [[Mining|mines]]; outlawed [[child labor]]ers under the age of 12; mandated compulsory school attendance; and enacted the nation's first [[workers' compensation]] law. The workers' compensation law was overturned in the courts, but was redrafted and finally enacted in 1910.

The [[Great Baltimore Fire]] of 1904 burned for more than 30 hours, destroying 1,526 buildings and spanning 70 city blocks. More than 1,231 [[firefighter]]s worked to bring the blaze under control.

With the nation's [[World War I#Entry of the United States|entry into World War I]] in 1917, new military bases such as [[Fort George G. Meade|Camp Meade]],  the [[Aberdeen Proving Ground]], and the [[Edgewood Arsenal]] were established. Existing facilities, including [[Fort McHenry]], were greatly expanded.

After Georgia congressman [[William D. Upshaw]] criticized Maryland openly in 1923 for not passing [[Prohibition in the United States|Prohibition]] laws, ''Baltimore Sun'' editor Hamilton Owens coined the "Free State" nickname for Maryland in that context, which was popularized by [[H. L. Mencken]] in a series of newspaper editorials.<ref name=freestate /><ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.baltimoresun.com/ph-ce-eagle-archive-1008-20121003-story.html |newspaper=The Baltimore Sun |date=October 7, 2012 |first=Kevin |last=Dayhoff |title=Eagle Archive: Here's a toast to Maryland's origins as 'The Free State' |access-date=February 8, 2018 }}</ref>

Maryland's urban and rural communities had different experiences during the [[Great Depression]]. The "[[Bonus Army]]" marched through the state in 1932 on its way to Washington, D.C. Maryland instituted its first ever [[income tax]] in 1937 to generate revenue for schools and welfare.<ref>

Baltimore was a major war production center during [[World War II]]. The biggest operations were [[Bethlehem Steel]]'s Fairfield Yard, which built [[Liberty ship]]s; and [[Glenn L. Martin Company|Glenn Martin]], an aircraft manufacturer.

====1950–present====
Maryland experienced population growth following World War II, particularly in the Baltimore and Washington, D.C. suburbs. Agricultural tracts gave way to residential communities, some of them carefully planned such as [[Columbia, Maryland|Columbia]], [[St. Charles, Maryland|St. Charles]], and [[Montgomery Village, Maryland|Montgomery Village]]. Concurrently the [[Interstate Highway System]] was built throughout the state, most notably [[Interstate 95 in Maryland|I-95]], [[Interstate 695 (Maryland)|I-695]], and the [[Interstate 495 (Capital Beltway)|Capital Beltway]], altering travel patterns. In 1952 the eastern and western halves of Maryland were linked for the first time by the [[Chesapeake Bay Bridge]], which replaced a nearby [[ferry]] service.<ref name="baybridge.com-history">{{cite web|url=http://www.baybridge.com/cms/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=16&Itemid=|title=William Preston Lane Jr. Memorial Bay Bridge – History|publisher=baybridge.com|accessdate=February 5, 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080701104741/http://www.baybridge.com/cms/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=16&Itemid=|archive-date=July 1, 2008|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}</ref>

Maryland's regions experienced economic changes following WWII. Heavy manufacturing declined in Baltimore. In Maryland's four westernmost counties, industrial, railroad, and coal mining jobs declined. On the lower [[Eastern Shore of Maryland|Eastern Shore]], family farms were bought up by major concerns and large-scale poultry farms and vegetable farming became prevalent. In Southern Maryland, tobacco farming nearly vanished due to suburban development and a state tobacco buy-out program.

In an effort to reverse depopulation due to the loss of working-class industries, Baltimore initiated [[urban renewal]] projects in the 1960s with [[Charles Center]] and the [[Baltimore World Trade Center]]. Some resulted in the break-up of intact residential neighborhoods, producing social volatility, and some older residential areas around the harbor have had units renovated and have become popular with new populations.

[[File:Maryland population map.png|thumb|upright=1.6|Maryland's population is concentrated mostly in the Baltimore and Washington metropolitan areas.]]
Most of the population of Maryland lives in the central region of the state, in the [[Baltimore Metropolitan Area]] and [[Washington Metropolitan Area]], both of which are part of the [[Baltimore-Washington Metropolitan Area]].
The majority of Maryland's population is concentrated in the cities and suburbs surrounding [[Washington, D.C.]], as well as in and around Maryland's most populous city, [[Baltimore]]. Historically, these and many other Maryland cities developed along the [[Atlantic Seaboard fall line|Fall Line]], the line along which rivers, brooks, and streams are interrupted by rapids and/or waterfalls. Maryland's capital city, [[Annapolis, Maryland|Annapolis]], is one exception to this pattern, since it lies along the banks of the [[Severn River (Maryland)|Severn River]], close to where it empties into the [[Chesapeake Bay]].

The Eastern Shore is less populous and more rural, as are the counties of western Maryland. The two [[Western Maryland|westernmost]] counties of Maryland, [[Allegany County, Maryland|Allegany]] and [[Garrett County, Maryland|Garrett]], are mountainous and sparsely populated, resembling West Virginia and [[Appalachia]] more than they do the rest of Maryland. Both eastern and western Maryland are, however, dotted with cities of regional importance, such as [[Ocean City, Maryland|Ocean City]], [[Princess Anne, Maryland|Princess Anne]], and [[Salisbury, Maryland|Salisbury]] on the [[Eastern Shore of Maryland|Eastern Shore]] and [[Cumberland, Maryland|Cumberland]], [[Frostburg, Maryland|Frostburg]], and [[Hancock, Maryland|Hancock]] in [[Western Maryland]].
Southern Maryland is still somewhat rural, but suburbanization from Washington, D.C. has encroached significantly since the 1960s; important local population centers include  [[Lexington Park, Maryland|Lexington Park]], [[Prince Frederick, Maryland|Prince Frederick]], and [[Waldorf, Maryland|Waldorf]].<ref>{{cite web | url=https://nepis.epa.gov/Exe/ZyNET.exe/P1000II5.TXT?ZyActionD=ZyDocument&Client=EPA&Index=2000+Thru+2005&Docs=&Query=&Time=&EndTime=&SearchMethod=1&TocRestrict=n&Toc=&TocEntry=&QField=&QFieldYear=&QFieldMonth=&QFieldDay=&IntQFieldOp=0&ExtQFieldOp=0&XmlQuery=&File=D%3A%5Czyfiles%5CIndex%20Data%5C00thru05%5CTxt%5C00000014%5CP1000II5.txt&User=ANONYMOUS&Password=anonymous&SortMethod=h%7C-&MaximumDocuments=1&FuzzyDegree=0&ImageQuality=r75g8/r75g8/x150y150g16/i425&Display=hpfr&DefSeekPage=x&SearchBack=ZyActionL&Back=ZyActionS&BackDesc=Results%20page&MaximumPages=1&ZyEntry=1&SeekPage=x&ZyPURL | title=Calvert County, Maryland's Success in Controlling Sprawl | publisher=Environmental Protection Agency | accessdate=September 3, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/local/longterm/library/growth/part1/southmd.htm | title=On Edge | work=The Washington Post | date=February 16, 1997 | accessdate=September 3, 2016 | author=Shields, Todd}}</ref>

A large percentage of the population of the [[Eastern Shore of Maryland|Eastern Shore]] and [[Southern Maryland]] are descendants of [[British American]] ancestry. The Eastern Shore was settled by Protestants, chiefly [[Methodist]] and the southern counties were initially settled by English Catholics. Western and northern Maryland have large [[German-American]] populations. More recent European immigrants of the late 19th and early 20th century settled first in Baltimore, attracted to its industrial jobs. Many of their ethnic [[History of the Italians in Baltimore|Italian]], [[History of the Poles in Baltimore|Polish]], [[History of the Czechs in Baltimore|Czech]], [[History of the Lithuanians in Baltimore|Lithuanian]], and [[History of the Greeks in Baltimore|Greek]] descendants still live in the area.

[[File:BasilicaExterior.jpg|thumb|The [[Baltimore Basilica]] was the first [[Roman Catholic|Catholic]] [[cathedral]] built in the [[United States|U.S.]].]]
Maryland has been historically prominent to [[Catholic Church in the United States|American Catholic tradition]] because the English [[colony of Maryland]] was intended by [[George Calvert]] as a haven for English Catholics. Baltimore was the seat of the first Catholic bishop in the U.S. (1789), and [[Emmitsburg]] was the home and burial place of the first American-born citizen to be [[canonized]], [[St. Elizabeth Ann Seton]]. [[Georgetown University]], the first Catholic University, was founded in 1789 in what was then part of Maryland.<ref>It became a part of the District of Columbia when that city was created in the 1790s.</ref> The [[Basilica of the National Shrine of the Assumption of the Virgin Mary]] in Baltimore was the first Roman Catholic cathedral built in the United States, and the [[Archbishop of Baltimore]] is, albeit without formal primacy, the United States' quasi-[[primate (bishop)|primate]],{{citation needed|date=July 2015}} and often a cardinal. Among the immigrants of the 19th and 20th century from eastern and southern Europe were many Catholics.

Despite its historic relevance to the Catholic Church in the United States, the percentage of Catholics in the state of Maryland is below the national average of 20%. Demographically, both Protestants and those identifying no religion are more numerous than Catholics.

According to Pew research 69 percent of Maryland's population identifies as Christian.<ref name="Pew Religion and Politics" /> The largest religious groups in Maryland as of 2010 were: the [[Catholic Church]] with 837,338 adherents in Maryland, followed by non-denominational [[Evangelical Protestant]]s with 298,921 members, and the [[United Methodist Church]] with 238,774. The [[Southern Baptist Convention]] has 150,345 members.<ref name="www.thearda.com">{{cite web|url=http://www.thearda.com/rcms2010/r/s/24/rcms2010_24_state_adh_2010.asp |title=The Association of Religion Data Archives &#124; State Membership Report |publisher=www.thearda.com |accessdate=November 15, 2013}}</ref>

Maryland's economy benefits from the state's close proximity to the federal government in [[Washington, D.C.]] with an emphasis on technical and administrative tasks for the defense/aerospace industry and bio-research laboratories, as well as staffing of satellite government headquarters in the suburban or exurban Baltimore/Washington area. Ft. Meade serves as the headquarters of the [[Defense Information Systems Agency]], [[United States Cyber Command]], and the [[National Security Agency]]/[[Central Security Service]]. In addition, a number of educational and medical research institutions are located in the state. In fact, the various components of The [[Johns Hopkins University]] and its medical research facilities are now the largest single employer in the Baltimore area. Altogether, [[White-collar worker|white collar]] technical and administrative workers comprise 25 percent of Maryland's [[labor force]],{{citation needed|date=March 2016}} attributable in part to nearby Maryland being a part of the [[Washington Metro Area]] where the federal government office employment is relatively high.

Manufacturing, while large in dollar value, is highly diversified with no sub-sector contributing over 20 percent of the total. Typical forms of manufacturing include electronics, computer equipment, and chemicals. The once mighty primary metals sub-sector, which at one time included what was then the largest steel factory in the world at [[Sparrows Point]], still exists, but is pressed with foreign competition, [[Bankruptcy|bankruptcies]], and [[merger]]s. During World War II the Glenn Martin Company (now part of [[Lockheed Martin]]) airplane factory employed some 40,000 people.

Mining other than construction materials is virtually limited to coal, which is located in the mountainous western part of the state. The brownstone quarries in the east, which gave Baltimore and Washington much of their characteristic architecture in the mid-19th century, were once a predominant natural resource. Historically, there used to be small gold-mining operations in Maryland, some near Washington, but these no longer exist.

===Baltimore port===
One major service activity is transportation, centered on the [[Port of Baltimore]] and its related [[railroad|rail]] and trucking access. The port ranked 17th in the U.S. by tonnage in 2008.<ref>U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. Waterborne Commerce Statistics Center. New Orleans, LA. [http://www.iwr.usace.army.mil/ndc/wcsc/portname08.htm "Tonnage for Selected U.S. Ports in 2008."] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100731081240/http://www.iwr.usace.army.mil/ndc/wcsc/portname08.htm |date=July 31, 2010 }} Revised February 17, 2010.</ref> Although the port handles a wide variety of products, the most typical imports are raw materials and bulk commodities, such as [[iron ore]], [[petroleum]], [[sugar]], and [[fertilizer]]s, often distributed to the relatively close manufacturing centers of the inland [[Midwest]] via good overland transportation. The port also receives several different brands of imported motor vehicles and is the number one auto port in the U.S.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://automotivelogistics.media/buyers-guide/port-of-baltimore-5 |title=Port of Baltimore |website=Automotive Logistics Buyers' Guide |access-date=May 22, 2017 |publisher=Ultima Media |quote=The Port of Baltimore handles more autos than any other US port. |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170525202955/http://automotivelogistics.media/buyers-guide/port-of-baltimore-5 |archive-date=May 25, 2017 |dead-url=yes |df=mdy-all }}</ref>

Baltimore City is the eighth largest port in the nation, and was at the center of the February 2006 [[Dubai Ports World controversy|controversy]] over the [[Dubai Ports World]] deal because it was considered to be of such strategic importance. The state as a whole is heavily industrialized, with a booming economy and influential technology centers. Its computer industries are some of the most sophisticated in the United States, and the federal government has invested heavily in the area. Maryland is home to several large military bases and scores of high level government jobs.

The [[Chesapeake and Delaware Canal]] is a {{convert|14|mi|km}} [[canal]] on the Eastern Shore that connects the waters of the Delaware River with those of the Chesapeake Bay, and in particular with the Port of Baltimore, carrying 40 percent of the port's ship traffic.<ref>{{cite web |publisher=U.S. Army Corps of Engineers |place=Philadelphia, PA |url=http://www.nap.usace.army.mil/Missions/CivilWorks/ChesapeakeDelawareCanal.aspx |title=Chesapeake and Delaware Canal |accessdate=September 28, 2013}}</ref>

===Agriculture and fishing===
Maryland has a large food-production sector. A large component of this is commercial [[List of freshwater fishes of Maryland|fishing]], centered in the Chesapeake Bay, but also including activity off the short Atlantic seacoast. The largest catches by species are the [[Callinectes sapidus|blue crab]], [[oysters]], [[striped bass]], and [[menhaden]]. The Bay also has overwintering waterfowl in its wildlife refuges. The waterfowl support a [[birdwatching|tourism sector of sportsmen]].

[[File:CarrollCountyMD.jpg|thumb|Agriculture is an important part of the state's economy]]
Maryland has large areas of fertile agricultural land in its coastal and [[Piedmont Plateau|Piedmont]] zones, though this land use is being encroached upon by urbanization. Agriculture is oriented to dairy farming (especially in foothill and piedmont areas) for nearby large city milksheads plus specialty perishable horticulture crops, such as [[cucumber]]s, [[watermelon]]s, [[sweet corn]], [[tomato]]es, [[muskmelon]]s, [[Squash (fruit)|squash]], and [[peas]] (Source:USDA Crop Profiles). In addition, the southern counties of the western shoreline of Chesapeake Bay are warm enough to support a [[tobacco]] [[cash crop]] zone, which has existed since early Colonial times but declined greatly after a state government buyout in the 1990s. There is also a large automated [[chicken]]-farming sector in the state's southeastern part; [[Salisbury, Maryland|Salisbury]] is home to [[Perdue Farms]]. Maryland's food-processing plants are the most significant type of manufacturing by value in the state.

===Biotechnology===
Maryland is a major center for [[life sciences]] research and development. With more than 400 biotechnology companies located there, Maryland is the fourth-largest nexus in this field in the United States.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://marylandbiocenter.org/Bioscience%20of%20Maryland/Pages/factsandfigures.aspx |title=Maryland's Bioscience Environment: 2009 |accessdate=August 19, 2011 |publisher=The Maryland Biotechnology Center |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110820175129/http://marylandbiocenter.org/Bioscience%20of%20Maryland/Pages/factsandfigures.aspx |archive-date=August 20, 2011 |dead-url=yes |df=mdy-all }}</ref>

Institutions and government agencies with an interest in research and development located in Maryland include the [[Johns Hopkins University]], the [[Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory]], more than one campus of the [[University System of Maryland]], [[Goddard Space Flight Center]], the [[United States Census Bureau]], the [[National Institutes of Health]] (NIH), the [[National Institute of Standards and Technology]] (NIST), the [[National Institute of Mental Health]] (NIMH), the [[Walter Reed National Military Medical Center]], the federal [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA), the [[Howard Hughes Medical Institute]], the [[Celera Genomics]] company, the [[J. Craig Venter Institute]] (JCVI), and [[MedImmune]]&nbsp;– recently purchased by [[AstraZeneca]].

Maryland is home to defense contractor [[Emergent BioSolutions]], which manufactures and provides an [[anthrax vaccine]] to U.S. government military personnel.<ref>{{cite news|title=Emergent BioSolutions Receives Orphan Drug Designation for BioThrax for Post-Exposure Prophylaxis of Anthrax Disease|url=http://www.marketwatch.com/story/emergent-biosolutions-receives-orphan-drug-designation-for-biothrax-for-post-exposure-prophylaxis-of-anthrax-disease-2014-04-21|access-date=August 29, 2016|work=Marketwatch.com|publisher=Dow Jones & Company|date=April 21, 2014}}</ref>

===Tourism===
[[File:Ocean City MD beach looking north from pier.jpeg|thumb|right|The beach resort town of Ocean City along the Atlantic Ocean is a popular tourist destination in Maryland]]
{{See also|List of National Historic Landmarks in Maryland}}
Tourism is popular in Maryland, with tourists visiting the city of Baltimore, the beaches of the Eastern Shore, and the nature of western Maryland, as well as many passing through on the way to Washington, D.C. Baltimore attractions include the [[Harborplace]], the [[Baltimore Aquarium]], [[Fort McHenry]], as well as the [[Camden Yards]] baseball stadium.
[[Ocean City, Maryland|Ocean City]] on the Atlantic Coast has been a popular beach destination in summer, particularly since the [[Chesapeake Bay Bridge]] was built in 1952 connecting the Eastern Shore to the more populated Maryland cities.<ref name="baybridge.com-history"/> The state capital of [[Annapolis]] offers sites such as the [[Maryland State House|state capitol building]], the [[Colonial Annapolis Historic District|historic district]], and the waterfront.
Maryland also has several sites of interest to military history, given Maryland's role in the [[Maryland in the American Civil War|American Civil War]] and in the [[Battle of Baltimore|War of 1812]]. Other attractions include the historic and picturesque towns along the [[Chesapeake Bay]], such as [[St. Mary's City, Maryland|Saint Mary's]],  Maryland's first colonial settlement and original capital.<ref name="darkroom.baltimoresun.com">Kenneth K.

{{See also|List of Interstate Highways in Maryland|List of Maryland state highways|List of minor Maryland state highways|List of former Maryland state highways}}

Maryland's [[Interstate Highway System|Interstate highways]] include {{convert|110|mi|km}} of [[Interstate 95 in Maryland|Interstate&nbsp;95]] (I-95), which enters the northeast portion of the state, travels through [[Baltimore]], and becomes part of the eastern section of the [[Interstate 495 (Capital Beltway)|Capital Beltway]] to the [[Woodrow Wilson Bridge]]. [[Interstate 68 in Maryland|I-68]] travels {{convert|81|mi|km}}, connecting the western portions of the state to [[Interstate 70 in Maryland|I-70]] at the small town of Hancock. I-70 enters from Pennsylvania north of Hancock and continues east for {{convert|93|mi|km}} to Baltimore, connecting [[Hagerstown, Maryland|Hagerstown]] and [[Frederick, Maryland|Frederick]] along the way.

[[Interstate 83 in Maryland|I-83]] has {{convert|34|mi|km}} in Maryland and connects Baltimore to southern central Pennsylvania ([[Harrisburg, Pennsylvania|Harrisburg]] and [[York, Pennsylvania]]). Maryland also has an {{convert|11|mi|km|adj=on}} portion of [[Interstate 81 in Maryland|I-81]] that travels through the state near Hagerstown. [[Interstate 97|I-97]], fully contained within Anne Arundel County and the second shortest ({{convert|17.6|mi|km}}) one- or two-digit interstate highway in the US, connects the Baltimore area to the Annapolis area. (Hawaii has one that is shorter.){{Clarify|date=May 2014}}

There are also several [[List of auxiliary Interstate Highways|auxiliary Interstate highways]] in Maryland. Among them are two beltways encircling the major cities of the region: [[Interstate 695 (Maryland)|I-695]], the McKeldin (Baltimore) Beltway, which encircles Baltimore; and a portion of [[Interstate 495 (Capital Beltway)|I-495]], the Capital Beltway, which encircles Washington, D.C. [[Interstate 270 (Maryland)|I-270]], which connects the Frederick area with Northern Virginia and the District of Columbia through major suburbs to the northwest of Washington, is a major commuter route and is as wide as fourteen lanes at points.

Both I-270 and the Capital Beltway were extremely [[Traffic congestion|congested]]; however, the [[Intercounty Connector]] (ICC; [[Maryland Route 200|MD&nbsp;200]]) has alleviated some of the congestion over time. Construction of the ICC was a major part of the campaign platform of former Governor [[Robert Ehrlich]], who was in office from 2003 until 2007, and of Governor [[Martin O'Malley]], who succeeded him. [[Interstate 595 (Maryland)|I-595]], which is an [[unsigned highway]] concurrent with [[U.S. Route 50 in Maryland|US&nbsp;50]]/[[U.S. Route 301 in Maryland|US&nbsp;301]], is the longest unsigned interstate in the country and connects [[Prince George's County, Maryland|Prince George's County]] and [[Washington D.C.]] with [[Annapolis]] and the [[Eastern Shore of Maryland|Eastern Shore]] via the [[Chesapeake Bay Bridge]].

[[File:Chesapeake Bay Bridge.jpg|thumb|right|upright|The [[Chesapeake Bay Bridge]] connects Maryland's [[Eastern Shore of Maryland|Eastern]] and [[Western Shore|Western]] Shores.]]

Maryland also has a [[state highway]] system that contains routes numbered from 2 through 999, however most of the higher-numbered routes are either unsigned or are relatively short. Major state highways include Routes [[Maryland Route 2|2]] (Governor Ritchie Highway/Solomons Island Road/Southern Maryland Blvd.), [[Maryland Route 4|4]] ([[Pennsylvania Avenue (Washington, D.C.)|Pennsylvania Avenue]]/Southern Maryland Blvd./Patuxent Beach Road/St. Andrew's Church Road), [[Maryland Route 5|5]] (Branch Avenue/Leonardtown Road/Point Lookout Road), [[Maryland Route 32|32]], [[Maryland Route 45|45]] (York Road), [[Maryland Route 97|97]] (Georgia Avenue), [[Maryland Route 100|100]] (Paul T. Pitcher Memorial Highway), [[Maryland Route 210|210]] (Indian Head Highway), [[Maryland Route 235|235]] (Three Notch Road), [[Maryland Route 295|295]] (Baltimore-Washington Parkway), [[Maryland Route 355|355]] (Wisconsin Avenue/Rockville Pike/Frederick Road), [[Maryland Route 404|404]] (Queen Anne Highway/ Shore Highway), and [[Maryland Route 650|650]] (New Hampshire Avenue).

===Airports===
{{See also|Aviation in Maryland|List of airports in Maryland}}
Maryland's largest airport is [[Baltimore-Washington International Thurgood Marshall Airport]], more commonly referred to as BWI. The airport is named for the Baltimore-born [[Thurgood Marshall]], the first African-American [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court justice]]. The only other airports with commercial service are at [[Hagerstown Regional Airport|Hagerstown]] and [[Wicomico Regional Airport|Salisbury]].

The Maryland suburbs of Washington, D.C. are also served by the other two airports in the region, [[Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport]] and [[Dulles International Airport]], both in [[Northern Virginia]]. The [[College Park Airport]] is the nation's oldest, founded in 1909, and is still used.

The [[WMATA]]'s [[Washington Metro|Metrorail]] [[rapid transit]] and [[Metrobus (Washington, D.C.)|Metrobus]] local bus systems (the [[List of United States rapid transit systems by ridership|2nd]] and [[List of United States local bus agencies by ridership|6th]] busiest in the nation of their respective modes) provide service in Montgomery and Prince George's counties and connect them to Washington D.C., with the express Metrobus [[Route B30 (WMATA)|''Route B30'']] serving [[BWI Thurgood Marshall Airport|BWI Airport]]. The [[Maryland Transit Administration]] (often abbreviated as "MTA Maryland"), a state agency part of the [[Maryland Department of Transportation]] also provides transit services within the state. Headquartered in Baltimore, MTA's transit services are largely focused on central Maryland, as well as some portions of the Eastern Shore and Southern MD. Baltimore's [[Baltimore Light RailLink|Light RailLink]] and [[Baltimore Metro SubwayLink|Metro SubwayLink]] systems serve its densely populated inner-city and the surrounding suburbs. The MTA also serves the city and its suburbs with its [[MTA Maryland bus service|local bus]] service (the [[List of United States local bus agencies by ridership|9th largest system]] in the nation). The MTA's [[Maryland Transit Administration#Commuter bus|Commuter Bus]] system provides express coach service on longer routes connecting Washington D.C. and Baltimore to parts of Central and Southern MD as well as the Eastern Shore. The commuter rail service, known as [[Maryland Area Rail Commuter|MARC]], operates three lines which all terminate at [[Washington Union Station]] and provide service to Baltimore's [[Baltimore Penn Station|Penn]] and [[Camden Station|Camden]] stations, [[Perryville, Maryland|Perryville]], [[Frederick, Maryland|Frederick]], and [[Martinsburg, West Virginia|Martinsburg, WV]]. In addition, many suburban counties operate their own local bus systems which connect to and complement the larger MTA and WMATA/Metro services.

[[Freight rail transport]] is handled principally by two [[Class I railroad]]s, as well as several smaller regional and local carriers.

{{Main|Government of Maryland}}
{{See also|List of Governors of Maryland|Maryland Army National Guard|Maryland Air National Guard}}
The [[government of Maryland]] is conducted according to the [[Maryland Constitution|state constitution]]. The government of Maryland, like the other 49 [[Politics of the United States#State government|state governments]], has exclusive authority over matters that lie entirely within the state's borders, except as limited by the [[Constitution of the United States]].

Power in Maryland is divided among three branches of government: [[executive branch|executive]], [[legislative branch|legislative]], and [[judicial branch|judicial]]. The [[Maryland General Assembly]] is composed of the [[Maryland House of Delegates]] and the [[Maryland Senate]]. [[Governor of Maryland|Maryland's governor]] is unique in the United States as the office is vested with significant authority in budgeting. The legislature may not increase the governor's proposed budget expenditures. Unlike many other states, significant autonomy is granted to many of Maryland's [[County (United States)|counties]].

Most of the business of government is conducted in [[Annapolis, Maryland|Annapolis]], the state [[Capital (political)|capital]]. Elections for governor and most statewide offices, as well as most county elections, are held in [[United States midterm election|midterm-election years]] (even-numbered years not divisible by four).

The judicial branch of state government consists of one united District Court of Maryland that sits in every county and Baltimore City, as well as 24 Circuit Courts sitting in each County and Baltimore City, the latter being courts of general jurisdiction for all civil disputes over $30,000.00, all equitable jurisdiction and major criminal proceedings. The intermediate appellate court is known as the [[Maryland Court of Special Appeals|Court of Special Appeals]] and the [[state supreme court]] is the [[Maryland Court of Appeals|Court of Appeals]]. The appearance of the judges of the Maryland Court of Appeals is unique; Maryland is the only state whose judges wear red robes.<ref>Lamy, Rudolf B. (2006).

===Taxation===
Maryland imposes five [[income tax]] brackets, ranging from 2 to 6.25 percent of personal income.<ref>{{cite web

}}</ref> The city of Baltimore and Maryland's 23 counties levy local "piggyback" income taxes at rates between 1.25 and 3.2 percent of Maryland taxable income. Local officials set the rates and the revenue is returned to the local governments quarterly. The top income tax bracket of 9.45 percent is the fifth highest combined state and local income tax rates in the country, behind New York City's 11.35 percent, California's 10.3 percent, Rhode Island's 9.9 percent, and Vermont's 9.5 percent.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://individuals.marylandtaxes.com/incometax/localtax.asp |title=Maryland Income Tax Information – Local Tax Rates |publisher=Individuals.marylandtaxes.com |accessdate=September 22, 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080920134243/http://individuals.marylandtaxes.com/incometax/localtax.asp |archivedate=September 20, 2008 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>

Maryland's state [[sales tax]] is 6 percent.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}} All real property in Maryland is subject to the [[property tax]].{{citation needed|date=April 2017}} Generally, properties that are owned and used by religious, charitable, or educational organizations or property owned by the federal, state or local governments are exempt.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}} Property tax rates vary widely.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}} No restrictions or limitations on property taxes are imposed by the state, meaning cities and counties can set tax rates at the level they deem necessary to fund governmental services.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}

As of July 2017,<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://factfinder.census.gov/bkmk/table/1.0/en/PEP/2017/PEPANNRES/0400000US24.05000 | title=American FactFinder - Results}}</ref> sixty-six percent of the state's population resides in these six jurisdictions, most of which contain large, traditionally Democratic [[Voting bloc|voting bloc(s)]]: [[African Americans]] in Baltimore City and Prince George's, [[Federal government of the United States|federal]] employees in Prince George's, Anne Arundel, and Montgomery, and [[Postgraduate education|postgraduates]] in Montgomery.

The 2006 election brought no change in the pattern of Democratic dominance. After Democratic Senator [[Paul Sarbanes]] announced that he was retiring, Democratic Congressman [[Benjamin Cardin]] defeated Republican Lieutenant Governor [[Michael S. Steele]], with 55 percent of the vote, against Steele's 44 percent.

While Republicans usually win more counties, by piling up large margins in the west and east, they are also usually swamped by the more densely populated and heavily Democratic Baltimore–Washington axis. In 2008, for instance, McCain won 17 counties to Obama's six; Obama also carried Baltimore City. While McCain won most of the western and eastern counties by margins of 2-to-1 or more, he was almost completely shut out in the larger counties surrounding Baltimore and Washington; every large county except Anne Arundel went for Obama.<ref>[http://www.cnn.com/ELECTION/2008/results/individual/#mapPMD Local and National Election Results&nbsp;– Election Center 2008&nbsp;– Elections & Politics from].

{{See also|List of colleges and universities in Maryland}}

Maryland has several historic and renowned private colleges and universities, the most prominent of which is [[Johns Hopkins University]], founded in 1876 with a grant from Baltimore entrepreneur [[Johns Hopkins]].

The first public university in the state is the [[University of Maryland, Baltimore]], which was founded in 1807 and contains the University of Maryland's only public academic [[University of Maryland School of Medicine|health]], human services, and one of two [[University of Maryland School of Law|law centers]] (the other being the [[University of Baltimore School of Law]]). Seven professional and graduate schools train the majority of the state's physicians, nurses, dentists, lawyers, social workers, and pharmacists.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.umaryland.edu/about-umb/umb-fast-facts/ |publisher=University of Maryland, Baltimore |title=UMB Fast Facts |access-date=May 21, 2017 }}</ref> The flagship university and largest undergraduate institution in Maryland is the [[University of Maryland, College Park]] which was founded as the Maryland Agricultural College in 1856 and became a public [[land grant college]] in 1864. [[Towson University]], founded in 1866, is the state's second largest university. Baltimore is home to the [[University of Maryland, Baltimore County]] and the [[Maryland Institute College of Art]]. The majority of public universities in the state are affiliated with the [[University System of Maryland]]. Two state-funded institutions, [[Morgan State University]] and [[St. Mary's College of Maryland]], as well as two federally funded institutions, the [[Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences]] and the [[United States Naval Academy]], are not affiliated with the University System of Maryland.

[[St. John's College (Annapolis/Santa Fe)|St. John's College]] in [[Annapolis, Maryland]] and [[Washington College]] in [[Chestertown, Maryland]], both private institutions, are the two oldest colleges in the state, and are among the oldest in the country.

Maryland's 24 public library systems deliver public education for everyone in the state of Maryland through a curriculum that comprises three pillars: Self-Directed Education (books and materials in all formats, e-resources), Research Assistance & Instruction (individualized research assistance, classes for students of all ages), and Instructive & Enlightening Experiences (e.g., Summer Reading Clubs, author events).

Maryland's library systems include, in part:

* [[Baltimore County Public Library]] System
* [[Cecil County Public Library]]
* [[Enoch Pratt Free Library]]
* [[Harford County Public Library]]

* [[Montgomery County Public Libraries]]
* [[Prince George's County Memorial Library System]]
