'''William Penn''' (14 October 1644 – 30 July 1718) was the son of [[Sir William Penn]], and was an English nobleman, writer, early [[Religious Society of Friends|Quaker]], and founder of the English North American colony [[Province of Pennsylvania|the Province of Pennsylvania]]. He was an early advocate of democracy and [[religious freedom]], notable for his good relations and successful treaties with the [[Lenape]] Native Americans. Under his direction, the city of [[Philadelphia]] was planned and developed.

In 1681, [[Charles II of England|King Charles II]] handed over a large piece of his American land holdings to Penn to pay the debts the king owed to [[Admiral Sir William Penn|Penn's father]]. This land included present-day Pennsylvania and [[Delaware]]. Penn immediately set sail and took his first step on American soil in [[New Castle, Delaware|New Castle (now in Delaware)]] in 1682 after his trans-Atlantic journey.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.newcastlecrier.com/History.html|title=New Castle History|publisher=New Castle Crier|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110714172222/http://www.newcastlecrier.com/History.html|archivedate=14 July 2011}}</ref> On this occasion, the colonists pledged allegiance to Penn as their new [[proprietary colony|proprietor]], and the first [[Pennsylvania General Assembly|general assembly]] was held in the colony. Afterwards, Penn journeyed up the Delaware River and founded Philadelphia. However, Penn's [[Quaker]] government was not viewed favourably by the [[New Netherland|Dutch]], [[New Sweden|Swedish]], and [[British colonization of the Americas|English]] settlers in what is now [[Delaware]]. They had no "historical" allegiance to Pennsylvania, so they almost immediately began petitioning for their own assembly. In 1704 they achieved their goal when the three southernmost counties of Pennsylvania were permitted to split off and become the new semi-autonomous [[Delaware Colony|colony of Lower Delaware]]. As the most prominent, prosperous and influential "city" in the new colony, New Castle became the capital.

As one of the earlier supporters of colonial unification, Penn wrote and urged for a union of all the [[British colonization of the Americas|English colonies]] in what was to become the United States of America. The democratic principles that he set forth in the [[Frame of Government of Pennsylvania|Pennsylvania Frame of Government]] served as an inspiration for the [[United States Constitution]].
As a [[pacifist]] Quaker, Penn considered the problems of war and peace deeply. He developed a forward-looking project for a [[United States of Europe]] through the creation of a European Assembly made of deputies who could discuss and adjudicate controversies peacefully. He is therefore considered the very first thinker to suggest the creation of a [[European Parliament]].<ref>See ''[https://archive.org/details/anessaytowardsp00penngoog An Essay Towards the Present and Future Peace of Europe]'' (1693). Penn is often remembered as the first to envisage a [[European Parliament]]. See [[Daniele Archibugi]], [http://www.opendemocracy.net/can-europe-make-it/daniele-archibugi/william-penn-englishman-who-invented-european-parliament William Penn, the Englishman who invented the European Parliament] openDemocracy, 28 May 2014.</ref>

A man of deep religious convictions, Penn wrote numerous works in which he exhorted believers to adhere to the spirit of [[Primitive Christianity]].<ref>See his work ''Primitve Christianity Revived'' (1696)</ref> He was imprisoned several times in the [[Tower of London]] due to his faith, and his book ''[[No Cross, No Crown]]'' (1669), which he wrote while in prison, has become a Christian classic.<ref>Thomas Nelson (2009).

==Biography==

===Early years===
[[File:William Penn memorial.jpg|thumb|upright|right|William Penn was baptised in 1644 at [[All Hallows-by-the-Tower]] Church in London]]
[[File:Coat of Arms of William Penn.svg|175px|thumb|left|Coat of Arms of William Penn]]

William Penn was born in 1644 at [[Tower Hill]], London, the son of English Admiral Sir [[William Penn (Royal Navy officer)|William Penn]], and Margaret Jasper, from a Dutch family, previously the widow of a Dutch captain, and the daughter of a rich merchant from [[Rotterdam]].<ref>Hans Fantel, ''William Penn: Apostle of Dissent'', William Morrow & Co., New York, 1974, p. 6, {{ISBN|0-688-00310-9}}</ref> William Penn, Sr. served in the [[Commonwealth of England|Commonwealth]] Navy during the [[English Civil War]] and was rewarded by [[Oliver Cromwell]] with estates in Ireland. The lands were seized from Irish Catholics in retaliation for the failed [[Irish Rebellion of 1641]]. Admiral Penn took part in the restoration of [[Charles II of England|Charles II]] and was eventually knighted and served in the [[Royal Navy]]. At the time of his son's birth, Captain Penn was twenty-three and an ambitious naval officer in charge of quelling Irish Catholic unrest and blockading Irish ports.<ref>Fantel, p. 6</ref>

William Penn grew up during the rule of [[Oliver Cromwell]], who succeeded in leading a [[Puritan]] rebellion against [[Charles I of England|King Charles I]]; the king was beheaded when Penn was age 5.<ref name=F15>Fantel, p. 15</ref> Penn's father was often at sea. Little William caught [[smallpox]] at a young age, losing all his hair (he wore a wig until he left college), prompting his parents to move from the suburbs to an estate in [[Essex]].<ref>Bonamy Dobrée, ''William Penn: Quaker and Pioneer'', Houghton Mifflin Co., 1932, New York, p. 3</ref> The country life made a lasting impression on young Penn, and kindled in him a love of horticulture.<ref>Fantel, p. 12</ref> Their neighbour was famed diarist [[Samuel Pepys]], who was friendly at first but later secretly hostile to the Admiral, perhaps embittered in part by his failed seductions of both Penn's mother and his sister Peggy.<ref>Fantel, p. 16</ref>

Penn was educated first at [[Chigwell School]], by private tutors whilst in Ireland, and later at [[Christ Church, Oxford|Christ Church]], [[University of Oxford|Oxford]].<ref>"William Penn", Encyclopedia of World Biography, 2nd ed. 17 Vols. Gale Research, 1998. Reproduced in Biography Resource Center. Farmington Hills, Mich.: Thomson Gale. 2007.</ref> At that time, there were no state schools and nearly all educational institutions were affiliated with the Anglican Church. Children from poor families had to have a wealthy sponsor to get an education. Penn's education heavily leaned on the classical authors and "no novelties or conceited modern writers" were allowed including [[William Shakespeare]].<ref>Fantel, p. 13</ref> Foot racing was Penn's favourite sport, and he would often run the more than three-mile (5&nbsp;km) distance from his home to the school. The school itself was cast in an Anglican mode&nbsp;– strict, humourless, and somber&nbsp;– and teachers had to be pillars of virtue and provide sterling examples to their charges.<ref>Fantel, p. 14</ref> Though later opposing Anglicanism on religious grounds, Penn absorbed many Puritan behaviours, and was known later for his serious demeanor, strict behavior and lack of humor.<ref name=F15/>

After a failed mission to the [[Caribbean]], Admiral Penn and his family were exiled to his lands in Ireland. It was during this period, when Penn was about fifteen, that he met Thomas Loe, a Quaker [[missionary]], who was maligned by both Catholics and Protestants. Loe was admitted to the Penn household and during his discourses on the "Inner Light", young Penn recalled later that "the Lord visited me and gave me divine Impressions of Himself."<ref>Fantel, p. 23</ref>

A year later, Cromwell was dead, the royalists resurging, and the Penn family returned to England. The middle class aligned itself with the royalists and Admiral Penn was sent on a secret mission to bring back exiled Prince Charles. For his role in restoring the monarchy, Admiral Penn was knighted and gained a powerful position as Commissioner of the Navy.<ref>Fantel, pp. 25, 32</ref>

In 1660, Penn arrived at [[University of Oxford|Oxford]] and enrolled as a gentleman scholar with an assigned servant. The student body was a volatile mix of [[swashbuckling]] Cavaliers (aristocratic Anglicans), sober Puritans, and nonconforming Quakers. The new government's discouragement of religious dissent gave the Cavaliers the license to harass the minority groups. Because of his father's high position and social status, young Penn was firmly a Cavalier but his sympathies lay with the persecuted Quakers. To avoid conflict, he withdrew from the fray and became a reclusive scholar.<ref name="Fantel">Fantel, p. 29</ref> Also at this time, Penn was developing his individuality and philosophy of life. He found that he was not in sympathy with either his father's martial view of the world or his mother's society-oriented sensibilities, "I had no relations that inclined to so solitary and spiritual way; I was a child alone. A child given to musing, occasionally feeling the divine presence."<ref>Dobrée, p. 9</ref>

Penn returned home for the extraordinary splendor of the King's restoration ceremony and was a guest of honor alongside his father, who received a highly unusual royal salute for his services to the Crown.<ref name="Fantel"/> Though undetermined at the time, the Admiral had great hopes for his son's career under the favour of the King. Back at Oxford, Penn considered a medical career and took some dissecting classes. Rational thought began to spread into science, politics and economics, which he took a liking to. When theologian [[John Owen (theologian)|John Owen]] was fired from his deanery, Penn and other open-minded students rallied to his side and attended seminars at the dean's house, where intellectual discussions covered the gamut of new thought.<ref>Fantel, p. 35</ref> Penn learned the valuable skills of forming ideas into theory, discussing theory through reasoned debate, and testing the theories in the real world.

At this time he also faced his first moral dilemma. After Owen was censured again after being fired, students were threatened with punishment for associating with him. However, Penn stood by the dean, thereby gaining a fine and reprimand from the university.<ref>Fantel, p. 37</ref> The Admiral, despairing of the charges, pulled young Penn away from Oxford, hoping to distract him from the heretical influences of the university.<ref>Fantel, p. 38</ref> The attempt had no effect and father and son struggled to understand each other. Back at school, the administration imposed stricter religious requirements including daily chapel attendance and required dress. Penn rebelled against enforced worship and was expelled. His father, in a rage, attacked young Penn with a cane and forced him from their home.<ref>Fantel, p. 43</ref> Penn's mother made peace in the family, which allowed her son to return home but she quickly concluded that both her social standing and her husband's career were being threatened by their son's behaviour. So at age 18, young Penn was sent to Paris to get him out of view, improve his manners, and expose him to another culture.<ref>Fantel, p. 45</ref>

In Paris, at the court of young [[Louis XIV]], Penn found French manners far more refined than the coarse manners of his countrymen&nbsp;– but the extravagant display of wealth and privilege did not sit well with him.<ref>Fantel, p. 49</ref> Though impressed by [[Notre-Dame de Paris|Notre Dame]] and the Catholic ritual, he felt uncomfortable with it. Instead he sought out spiritual direction from French Protestant theologian [[Moise Amyraut]], who invited Penn to stay with him in [[Saumur]] for a year.<ref>Fantel, p. 51</ref> The undogmatic Christian humanist talked of a tolerant, adapting view of religion which appealed to Penn, who later stated, "I never had any other religion in my life than what I felt."<ref>Fantel, p. 52</ref> By adapting his mentor's belief in free will, Penn felt unburdened of Puritanical guilt and rigid beliefs, and was inspired to search out his own religious path.<ref>Fantel, p. 53</ref>

Upon returning to England after two years abroad, he presented to his parents a mature, sophisticated, well-mannered, "modish" gentleman, though Samuel Pepys noted young Penn's "vanity of the French".<ref>Fantel, p. 54</ref> Penn had developed a taste for fine clothes, and for the rest of his life would pay somewhat more attention to his dress than most Quakers. The Admiral had great hopes that his son then had the practical sense and the ambition necessary to succeed as an aristocrat. He had young Penn enroll in law school but soon his studies were interrupted. With warfare with the Dutch imminent, young Penn decided to shadow his father at work and join him at sea.<ref>Fantel, p. 57</ref> Penn functioned as an emissary between his father and the King, then returned to his law studies. Worrying about his father in battle he wrote, "I never knew what a father was till I had wisdom enough to prize him... I pray God... that you come home secure."<ref>Fantel, p. 59</ref> The Admiral returned triumphant but London was in the grip of the [[Great Plague of London|plague]] of 1665. Young Penn reflected on the suffering and the deaths, and the way humans reacted to the epidemic. He wrote that the scourge "gave me a deep sense of the vanity of this World, of the Irreligiousness of the Religions in it."<ref>Fantel, p. 60</ref> Further he observed how Quakers on errands of mercy were arrested by the police and demonised by other religions, even accused of causing the plague.<ref>Fantel, p. 61</ref>
 
[[File:William Penn at 22 1666.jpg|thumb|right| William Penn at 22]]
With his father laid low by [[gout]], young Penn was sent to Ireland in 1666 to manage the family landholdings. While there he became a soldier and took part in suppressing a local Irish rebellion. Swelling with pride, he had his portrait painted wearing a suit of armour, his most authentic likeness.<ref>Dobrée, p. 23</ref> His first experience of warfare gave him the sudden idea of pursuing a military career, but the fever of battle soon wore off after his father discouraged him, "I can say nothing but advise to sobriety...I wish your youthful desires mayn't outrun your discretion."<ref>Fantel, p. 63</ref> While Penn was abroad, the [[Great Fire of 1666]] consumed central London. As with the plague, the Penn family was spared.<ref>Fantel, p. 64</ref> But after returning to the city, Penn was depressed by the mood of the city and his ailing father, so he went back to the family estate in Ireland to contemplate his future. The reign of King Charles had further tightened restrictions against all religious sects other than the Anglican Church, making the penalty for unauthorised worship imprisonment or deportation. The [[Five Mile Act 1665|"Five Mile Act"]] prohibited dissenting teachers and preachers to come within that distance of any borough.<ref>Dobrée, p. 21</ref> The Quakers were especially targeted and their meetings were deemed undesirable.

===Religious conversion===
Despite the dangers, Penn began to attend [[Religious Society of Friends|Quaker]] meetings near [[Cork (city)|Cork]]. A chance re-meeting with Thomas Loe confirmed Penn's rising attraction to Quakerism.<ref name=F69>Fantel, p. 69</ref> Soon Penn was arrested for attending Quaker meetings. Rather than state that he was not a Quaker and thereby dodge any charges, he publicly declared himself a member and finally joined the Quakers at the age of 22.<ref>Fantel, p. 72</ref> In pleading his case, Penn stated that since the Quakers had no political agenda (unlike the Puritans) they should not be subject to laws that restricted political action by minority religions and other groups. Sprung from jail because of his family's rank rather than his argument, Penn was immediately recalled to London by his father. The Admiral was severely distressed by his son's actions and took the conversion as a personal affront.<ref>Fantel, p. 75</ref> His father's hopes that Penn's charisma and intelligence would win him favour at the court were crushed.<ref>Fantel, p. 76</ref> Though enraged, the Admiral tried his best to reason with his son but to no avail. His father not only feared for his own position but that his son seemed bent on a dangerous confrontation with the Crown.<ref>Fantel, p. 77</ref> In the end, young Penn was more determined than ever, and the Admiral felt he had no option but to order his son out of the house and to withhold his inheritance.<ref name=F79>Fantel, p. 79</ref>

As Penn became homeless, he began to live with Quaker families.<ref name=F79/> Quakers were relatively strict Christians in the 17th century. They refused to bow or take off their hats to social superiors, believing all men equal under God, a belief antithetical to an absolute monarchy which believed the monarch divinely appointed by God. Therefore, Quakers were treated as heretics because of their principles and their failure to pay tithes. They also refused to swear oaths of loyalty to the King believing that this was following the command of Jesus not to swear. The basic ceremony of Quakerism was silent worship in a meeting house, conducted in a group.<ref name=F69/> There was no ritual and no professional clergy, and many Quakers disavowed the concept of [[original sin]]. God's communication came to each individual directly, and if so moved, the individual shared his revelations, thoughts or opinions with the group. Penn found all these tenets to sit well with his conscience and his heart.

Penn became a close friend of [[George Fox]], the founder of the Quakers, whose movement started in the 1650s during the tumult of the Cromwellian revolution. The times sprouted many new sects besides Quakers, including [[Seekers]], [[Ranters]], [[Antinomianism|Antinomians]], Seventh Day Baptists, [[Soul sleep]]ers, [[Adamites]], [[Diggers]], [[Levellers]], Anabaptists (such as Swiss and German Mennonites, etc.), [[Behmenists]], [[Muggletonians]], and many others, as the Puritans were more tolerant than the monarchy had been.<ref>Fantel, p. 83</ref><ref>Dobrée, p. 63</ref> Following Oliver Cromwell's death, however, the Crown was re-established and the King responded with harassment and persecution of all religions and sects other than Anglicanism. Fox risked his life, wandering from town to town, and he attracted followers who likewise believed that the "God who made the world did not dwell in temples made with hands."<ref>Fantel, pp. 80–1</ref> By abolishing the church's authority over the congregation, Fox not only extended the Protestant Reformation more radically, but he helped extend the most important principle of modern political history&nbsp;– the rights of the individual&nbsp;– upon which modern democracies were later founded.<ref>Fantel, p. 84</ref> Penn travelled frequently with Fox, through Europe and England. He also wrote a comprehensive, detailed explanation of Quakerism along with a testimony to the character of George Fox, in his introduction to the autobiographical ''Journal of George Fox''.<ref>[http://www.hallvworthington.com/wjournal/journalintro.html Journal of George Fox] (retrieved 25 September 2007)</ref> In effect, Penn became the first theologian, theorist, and legal defender of Quakerism, providing its written doctrine and helping to establish its public standing.<ref>Fantel, p. 88</ref>

===Penn in Ireland (1669–1670)===
In 1669,<ref>William Penn (1669–1670) My Irish Journal, edited by [[Isabel Grubb]], Longmans, 1952</ref> Penn travelled to Ireland to deal with many of his father's estates. While there, he attended many meetings and stayed with leading Quaker families. He became a great friend of William Morris, a leading Quaker figure in Cork, and often stayed with Morris at [[Castle Salem]] near [[Rosscarbery]].

===Penn in Germany (1671–1677)===
Between 1671 and 1677 William Penn made trips to Germany on behalf of the Quaker faith, resulting in a German Settlement in Pennsylvania that was symbolic in two ways: it was a specifically German-speaking congregation, and it comprised religious dissenters. Pennsylvania has remained the heartland for various branches of Anabaptists: Old Order Mennonites, Ephrata Cloisters, Brethren, and Amish. Pennsylvania also became home for many Lutheran refugees from Catholic provinces (e.g., [[Salzburg]]), as well as for German Catholics who had also been discriminated against in their home country.

In Philadelphia, [[Francis Daniel Pastorius]] negotiated the purchase of 15,000 acres (61&nbsp;km²) from his friend William Penn, the [[proprietor]] of the colony, and laid out the settlement of [[Germantown, Philadelphia|Germantown]]. The [[German Society of Pennsylvania]] was established in 1764 and is still functioning today from its headquarters in Philadelphia.

===Persecutions and imprisonments===
[[File:William Penn COA.svg|thumb|right|The coat of arms of William Penn: ''Argent, on a fess sable three plates'']]
Penn's first of many pamphlets, ''Truth Exalted: To Princes, Priests and People'' (1668), was a criticism of all religious groups, except Quakers, which he perceived as the only true Christian group living at that time in England. He branded the Catholic Church as "the [[Whore of Babylon]]", defied the Church of England, and called the Puritans "hypocrites and revelers in God". He also lambasted all "false prophets, tithemongers, and opposers of [[Christian perfection|perfection]]".<ref>Fantel, p. 97</ref> Pepys thought it a "ridiculous nonsensical book" that he was "ashamed to read".<ref>Dobrée, p. 43</ref>

In 1668 Penn was imprisoned in the [[Tower of London]] after writing a follow-up tract entitled ''The Sandy Foundation Shaken''. The Bishop of London ordered that Penn be held indefinitely until he publicly recanted his written statements. The official charge was publication without a license but the real crime was [[blasphemy]], as signed in a warrant by King Charles II.<ref name="Fantel-101">Fantel, p. 101</ref> Placed in solitary confinement in an unheated cell and threatened with a life sentence, Penn was being accused of denying the [[Trinity]], though this was a misinterpretation Penn himself refuted in the essay ''Innocency with her open face, presented by way of Apology for the book entitled the Sandy Foundation Shaken'', where he himself proceeded to prove the Godhead of Christ.<ref>''[https://books.google.com/books?id=QlsMAQAAMAAJ&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false Encyclopaedia Londinensis, or, Universal dictionary of arts, sciences, and literature]'', Volume 19, (1823). p. 543</ref> Penn said the rumour had been "maliciously insinuated" by detractors who wanted to create a bad reputation to Quakers.<ref>Hicks, Elias. "[https://archive.org/details/defenceofchristi00hick A Defence of the Christian doctrines of the Society of Friends: being a reply to the charge of denying the three that bear record in heaven]" (1825), pp. 35–37: "This conclusive argument for the proof of Christ, the Saviour's, being God, should certainly persuade all sober persons of my innocency, and my adversaries malice. He that is the everlasting Wisdom, divine Power, the true Light, the only Saviour, the creating Word of all things, whether visible or invisible, and their upholder, by his own power, is, without contradiction God&nbsp;– but all these qualifications, and divine properties, arc by the concurrent testimonies of Scripture, ascribed to the Lord Jesus Christ; therefore, without a scruple, I call and believe him, really to be, the mighty God.</ref> Later, he stated that what he really denied were the Catholic interpretations of this theological topic, and the use of unbiblical concepts to explain it.<ref>''"A Brief Answer to a False and Foolish Libel called The Quakers Opinions for their Sakes that Writ it and Read it"'' (1678). Sect. V, "''-Perversion 9-'': 'The Quakers deny the Trinity'. -Principle-: Nothing less. They believe in the ''Holy Three'', or ''Trinity'' of ''Father'', ''Word'', and ''Spirit'', according to Scripture. And that these Three are Truly and Properly Oe: Of ''One Nature'' as well as Will. But they are very tender of quitting ''Scripture Terms'' and ¿¿Phrases for ''Schoolmen's'', such as ''distinct and separate Persons'' and ''Substances'', etc. are, from whence People are apt to entertain gross Ideas and Notions of the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost."</ref><ref>Penn, William.

[http://www.christianquaker.net/index.php/art-vs/50-early-quakers-and-the-trinity "Early Quakers and the Trinity]." Christian Quaker.</ref> Penn expressly confessed he believed in the Holy Three as well as in the [[divinity of Christ]].<ref>Penn, William. (1726). ''A Collection of the Works of William Penn'', Vol. 2. J. Sowle. p. 783.: Sect. VI. "Of the Divinity of Christ. -Perversion- 10. 'The Quakers deny Christ to be God'. -'Principle'-: "A most Untrue and Unreasoble Censure: For their Great and ''Characteristick'' principle being this, That ''Christ, as the Divine Word, Lighten the Souls of all Men that come into the World, with a Spiritual and Saving Light'', according to ''John'' 1. 9. ch. 8.12 (which nothing but the Creator of Souls can do) it does sufficiently shew they believe him to be God, for they ''truly'' and ''expressly'' own him to be so, according to Scripture, ''viz: 'In him was Life, and that Life the Light of Men, and He is God over all, blessed for ever.''"</ref> In 1668 in a letter to the anti-Quaker minister Jonathan Clapham,  Penn wrote: "Thou must not, reader, from my querying thus, conclude we do deny (as he hath falsely charged us) those glorious Three, which bear record in heaven, the Father, Word, and Spirit; neither the infinity, eternity and divinity of Jesus Christ; for that we know he is the mighty God."<ref>Richardson, John (1829), ''The Friend: A Religious and Literary Journal, Volume 2''. p. 77</ref><ref>Longman, Hurst, Rees and Orme. (1817). ''The Monthly Repository of Theology and General Literature, Volume 12''. p. 348</ref>

Given writing materials in the hope that he would put on paper his retraction, Penn wrote another inflammatory treatise, ''No Cross, No Crown: A Discourse Shewing The Nature and Discipline of the Holy Cross of Christ and that the Denial of Self, and Daily Hearing of Christ's Cross, is the Alone Way to Rest and Kingdom of God.'' In it, Penn exhorted believers to adhere to the spirit of [[Primitive Christianity]]. This work was remarkable for its historical analysis and citation of 68 authors whose quotations and commentary he had committed to memory and was able to summon without any reference material at hand.<ref>Fantel, p. 105</ref> Penn petitioned for an audience with the King, which was denied but which led to negotiations on his behalf by one of the royal chaplains. Penn bravely declared, "My prison shall be my grave before I will budge a jot: for I owe my conscience to no mortal man."<ref name="Fantel-101"/> He was released after eight months of imprisonment.<ref>Fantel, p. 108</ref>

Penn demonstrated no remorse for his aggressive stance, and vowed to keep fighting against the wrongs of the Church and the King. For its part, the Crown continued to confiscate Quaker property and jailed thousands of Quakers. From then on, Penn's religious views effectively exiled him from English society; he was sent down (expelled) from [[Christ Church, Oxford|Christ Church College of Oxford University]] for being a Quaker, and was arrested several times. Among the most famous of these was the trial following his 1670 arrest with [[William Mead (merchant)|William Mead]]. Penn was accused of preaching before a gathering in the street, which Penn had deliberately provoked to test the validity of the 1664 Conventicle Act, just [[Conventicles Act 1670|renewed in 1670]], which denied the right of assembly to "more than five persons in addition to members of the family, for any religious purpose not according to the rules of the Church of England".<ref>{{Cite book|title=William Penn: An Historical Biography|last=Dixon|first=William|publisher=Blanchard and Lea|year=1851|isbn=|location=Philadelphia|pages=75, 76}}</ref> Penn pleaded for his right to see a copy of the charges laid against him and the laws he had supposedly broken, but the judge, Thomas Howel, refused, although this was a right guaranteed by law. Furthermore, the judge directed the jury to come to a verdict without hearing the defence.<ref>Fantel, pp. 117–120</ref><ref>{{cite web|last1=Duhaime|first1=Lloyd|title=1670: The Jury Earns Its Independence (Bushel's case)|url=http://www.duhaime.org/LawMuseum/LawArticle-1335/1670-The-Jury-Earns-Its-Independence-Bushels-case.aspx|website=duhaime.org|publisher=Lloyd Duhaime|accessdate=16 February 2016}}</ref>

[[File:William Penn & William Mead - plaque - 01.jpg|thumb|Plaque at the [[Old Bailey]] ]]

Despite heavy pressure from Howel to convict Penn, the jury returned a verdict of "not guilty". When invited by the judge to reconsider their verdict and to select a new foreman, they refused and were sent to a cell over several nights to mull over their decision. The Lord Mayor then told the jury, "You shall go together and bring in another verdict, or you shall starve", and not only had Penn sent to jail in [[Newgate Prison]] (on a charge of contempt of court for refusing to remove his hat), but the full jury followed him, and they were additionally fined the equivalent of a year's wages each.<ref>Fantel, p. 124</ref><ref>Dobrée, p. 71</ref> The members of the jury, fighting their case from prison in what became known as [[Bushel's Case]], managed to win the right for all English juries to be free from the control of judges.<ref name="Lehman">{{cite book |last=Lehman |first=Godfrey |authorlink=|title=The Ordeal of Edward Bushell |year=1996 |publisher=Lexicon |isbn=978-1-879563-04-9}}</ref> This case was one of the more important trials that shaped the concept of [[jury nullification]]<ref name=Abramson1994>{{cite book |title=We, The Jury |last=Abramson |first=Jeffrey |year=1994 |publisher=Harvard University Press |location=Cambridge, MA |isbn=978-0-674-00430-6 |pages=68–72}}</ref> and was a victory for the use of the writ of [[habeas corpus]] as a means of freeing those unlawfully detained.

With his father dying, Penn wanted to see him one more time and patch up their differences. But he urged his father not to pay his fine and free him, "I intreat thee not to purchase my liberty." But the Admiral refused to let the opportunity pass and he paid the fine, releasing his son.

The old man had gained respect for his son's integrity and courage and told him, "Let nothing in this world tempt you to wrong your conscience."<ref>Fantel, p. 126</ref> The Admiral also knew that after his death young Penn would become more vulnerable in his pursuit of justice. In an act which not only secured his son's protection, but also set the conditions for the founding of Pennsylvania, the Admiral wrote to the Duke of York, the successor to the throne.

The Duke and the King, in return for the Admiral's lifetime of service to the Crown, promised to protect young Penn and make him a royal counselor.<ref>Fantel, p. 127</ref>

Penn was not disinherited and he came into a large fortune, but found himself in jail again for six months as he continued to agitate. After gaining his freedom, he finally married Gulielma Springett in April 1672, after a four-year engagement filled with frequent separations. Penn stayed close to home but continued writing his tracts, espousing religious tolerance and railing against discriminatory laws.<ref>Fantel, pp. 139–140</ref> A minor split developed in the Quaker community between those who favoured Penn's analytical formulations and those who preferred Fox's simple precepts.<ref>Fantel, p. 143</ref> But the persecution of Quakers had accelerated and the differences were overridden; Penn again resumed missionary work in Holland and Germany.<ref>Fantel, p. 145</ref>

===Founding of Pennsylvania===
[[File:The Birth of Pennsylvania 1680 cph.3g07157.jpg|thumb|''The Birth of Pennsylvania'', 1680, by [[Jean Leon Gerome Ferris]]. William Penn, holding paper, standing and facing King Charles II, in the King's breakfast chamber at Whitehall. ]]
Seeing conditions deteriorating, Penn decided to appeal directly to the King and the Duke. Penn proposed a solution which would solve the dilemma—a mass emigration of English Quakers. Some Quakers had already moved to North America, but the [[New England]] [[Puritan]]s, especially, were as hostile towards Quakers as Anglicans in England were, and some of the Quakers had been banished to the [[Caribbean]].<ref>See, for example, the story of [[Jan Claus]], a gold- and silversmith who was arrested under the English [[Conventicle Act 1664|Conventicle Act of 1664]], convicted and sentenced to ship to Jamaica, survived an on-board plague that killed half the passengers, was captured by a [[privateer]], was taken back to the Netherlands and imprisoned, and finally saved by Friends who took him to settle in Amsterdam.</ref> In 1677 a group of prominent Quakers that included Penn purchased the colonial province of [[West Jersey]] (half of the current state of [[New Jersey]]).<ref>Dobrée, p. 102</ref> That same year, two hundred settlers from the towns of [[Chorleywood]] and [[Rickmansworth]] in Hertfordshire and other towns in nearby [[Buckinghamshire]] arrived, and founded the town of [[Burlington, New Jersey|Burlington]]. George Fox himself had made a journey to America to verify the potential of further expansion of the early Quaker settlements.<ref>Fantel, p. 147</ref> In 1682 [[East Jersey]] was also purchased by Quakers.<ref>Dobrée, p. 117</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ushistory.org/penn/bio.htm|title=Brief Biography of William Penn|website=www.ushistory.org|access-date=12 June 2017}}</ref>

With the New Jersey foothold in place, Penn pressed his case to extend the Quaker region. Whether from personal sympathy or political expediency, to Penn's surprise, the King granted an extraordinarily generous charter which made Penn the world's largest private (non-royal) landowner, with over {{convert|45000|sqmi|km2}}.<ref name="Miller">Randall M. Miller and William Pencak, ed., ''Pennsylvania: A History of the Commonwealth'', Penn State University Press, 2002, p. 59, {{ISBN|0-271-02213-2}}</ref>{{rp|64}} Penn became the sole proprietor of a huge tract of land west of New Jersey and north of [[Province of Maryland|Maryland]] (which belonged to [[Cecilius Calvert, 2nd Baron Baltimore|Lord Baltimore]]), and gained sovereign rule of the territory with all rights and privileges (except the power to declare war). The land of Pennsylvania had belonged to the Duke of York, who acquiesced, but he retained New York and the area around New Castle and the Eastern portion of the [[Delmarva Peninsula]].<ref>Dobrée, p. 119</ref> In return, one-fifth of all gold and silver mined in the province (which had virtually none) was to be remitted to the King, and the Crown was freed of a debt to the Admiral of £16,000, equal to £{{formatnum:{{Inflation|UK|16000|1681}}}} today.<ref>Fantel, pp. 147–8.</ref>

[[File:The belt of wampum delivered by the Indians to William Penn at the "Great Treaty" (1682).jpg|thumb|The belt of wampum delivered by the Indians to William Penn at the "Great Treaty" (1682)]]
Penn first called the area "New Wales", then "Sylvania" (Latin for "forests" or "woods"), which King Charles II changed to "Pennsylvania" in honor of the elder Penn.<ref>Dobrée, p. 120</ref> On 4 March 1681, the King signed the charter and the following day Penn jubilantly wrote, "It is a clear and just thing, and my God who has given it me through many difficulties, will, I believe, bless and make it the seed of a nation."<ref>Fantel, p. 149</ref> Penn then traveled to America and while there, he negotiated Pennsylvania's first land-purchase survey with the Lenape Indian tribe.  Penn purchased the first tract of land under a white oak tree at [[Graystones Forest|Graystones]] on 15 July 1682.<ref>[https://buckscountyintime.wordpress.com/2012/03/26/graystones-the-treaty-for-pennsylvania/ Graystones ~ The Treaty for Pennsylvania], buckscountyintime blog, accessed 25 November 2015</ref> Penn drafted a [[Pennsylvania Charter of Privileges|charter of liberties]] for the settlement creating a political [[utopia]] guaranteeing free and fair [[trial by jury]], [[freedom of religion]], freedom from unjust imprisonment and free elections.<ref>{{cite web

[[File:William Penn - The First Draft of the Frame of Government - c1681.jpg|thumb|upright|First draft of the [[Frame of Government of Pennsylvania]], written by Penn in England (c. 1681)]]
Having proved himself an influential scholar and theoretician, Penn now had to demonstrate the practical skills of a real estate promoter, city planner, and governor for his "Holy Experiment", the province of Pennsylvania.<ref>Fantel, p. 150</ref>

Besides achieving his religious goals, Penn had hoped that Pennsylvania would be a profitable venture for himself and his family. But he proclaimed that he would not exploit either the natives or the immigrants, "I would not abuse His love, nor act unworthy of His providence, and so defile what came to me clean."<ref name="Dobrée">Dobrée, p. 128</ref> To that end, Penn's land purchase from the Lenape included the latter party's retained right to traverse the sold lands for purposes of hunting, fishing, and gathering.<ref>Suzan Shown Harjo, ed., ''Nation to Nation: Treaties Between the United States & American Indian Nations'', Smithsonian Institution, 2014, p. 61</ref> Though thoroughly oppressed, getting Quakers to leave England and make the dangerous journey to the New World was his first commercial challenge. Some Quaker families had already arrived in Maryland and New Jersey but the numbers were small. To attract settlers in large numbers, he wrote a glowing prospectus, considered honest and well-researched for the time, promising religious freedom as well as material advantage, which he marketed throughout Europe in various languages. Within six months he had parcelled out {{convert|300000|acre|km2}} to over 250 prospective settlers, mostly rich London Quakers.<ref>Fantel, pp. 152–3</ref> Eventually he attracted other persecuted minorities including [[Huguenot]]s, [[Mennonite]]s, [[Amish]], [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholics]], [[Lutheranism|Lutherans]], and [[Jews]] from England, France, Holland, Germany, Sweden, Finland, Ireland, and Wales.<ref>Fantel, p. 194</ref>

Next, he set out to lay the legal framework for an ethical society where power was derived from the people, from "open discourse", in much the same way as a Quaker Meeting was run. Notably, as the sovereign, Penn thought it important to limit his own power as well.<ref>Fantel, p. 159</ref> The new government would have two houses, safeguard the rights of private property and free enterprise, and impose taxes fairly. It would call for death for only two crimes, treason and murder, rather than the [[Bloody Code|two hundred crimes]] under English law, and all cases were to be tried before a jury.<ref>Fantel, p. 161</ref> Prisons would be progressive, attempting to correct through "workshops" rather than through hellish confinement.<ref>Dobrée, p. 148</ref> The laws of behaviour he laid out were rather Puritanical: swearing, lying, and drunkenness were forbidden as well as "idle amusements" such as stage plays, gambling, revels, masques, [[cock-fighting]], and [[bear-baiting]].<ref>Dobrée, p. 149</ref>

All this was a radical departure from the laws and the lawmaking of European monarchs and elites. Over twenty drafts, Penn laboured to create his "Framework of Government". He borrowed liberally from [[John Locke]] who later had a similar influence on [[Thomas Jefferson]], but added his own revolutionary idea—the use of amendments—to enable a written framework that could evolve with the changing times.<ref>Fantel, p. 156</ref> He stated, "Governments, like clocks, go from the motion men give them."<ref>Dobrée, p. 131</ref> Penn hoped that an amendable constitution would accommodate dissent and new ideas and also allow meaningful societal change without resorting to violent uprisings or revolution.<ref>Fantel, p. 157</ref> Remarkably, though the Crown reserved the right to override any law it wished, Penn's skillful stewardship did not provoke any government reaction while Penn remained in his province.<ref>Dobrée, p. 150</ref> Despite criticism by some Quaker friends that Penn was setting himself above them by taking on this powerful position, and by his enemies who thought he was a fraud and "falsest villain upon earth", Penn was ready to begin the "Holy Experiment".<ref>Dobrée, p. 135</ref> Bidding goodbye to his wife and children, he reminded them to "avoid pride, avarice, and luxury".<ref>Dobrée, p. 138</ref>

===Back to England===
In 1684 Penn returned to England to see his family and to try to resolve a territorial dispute with Lord Baltimore.<ref>Fantel, p. 199</ref>
Penn did not always pay attention to details, and had not taken the fairly simple step of determining where the 40th degree of latitude (the southern boundary of his land under the charter) actually was. After he sent letters to several landowners in Maryland advising the recipients that they were probably in Pennsylvania and not to pay any more taxes to Lord Baltimore, trouble arose between the two proprietors.<ref>Soderlund, Jean R. (ed.) ''William Penn and the Founding of Pennsylvania'' Univ. Penn. Press (1983), p. 79</ref> This led to an eighty-year [[Penn–Calvert Boundary Dispute|legal dispute]] between the two families.

Political conditions at home had stiffened since Penn left. To his dismay, he found Bridewell and Newgate prisons filled with Quakers. Internal political conflicts even threatened to undo the Pennsylvania charter. Penn withheld his political writings from publication as "The times are too rough for print."<ref>Fantel, p. 203</ref>

In 1685 King Charles died and the Duke of York was crowned [[James II of England|James II]]. The new king resolved the border dispute in Penn's favour. But King James, a Catholic with a largely Protestant parliament, proved a poor ruler, stubborn and inflexible.<ref>Fantel, p. 209</ref> Penn supported James' [[Declaration of Indulgence]] which granted toleration to Quakers, and went on a "preaching tour through England to promote the King's Indulgence".<ref>Harris, Tim ''Revolution:The Great Crisis of the British Monarchy 1685–1720'' Allen Lane (2006) p218</ref> His proposal at the London Yearly Meeting of the Society of Friends in June 1688 to establish an "advisory committee that might offer counsel to individual Quakers deciding whether to take up public office" under James II was rebuffed by [[George Fox]], who argued that it was "not safe to conclude such things in a Yearly Meeting".<ref>Sowerby, Scott, ''Making Toleration: The Repealers and the Glorious Revolution'' Harvard University Press (2013), p. 144</ref>  Penn offered some assistance to James II's campaign to regulate the parliamentary constituencies by sending a letter to a friend in Huntingdon asking him to identify men who could be trusted to support the king's campaign for liberty of conscience.<ref>Sowerby, p. 140.</ref>

Penn faced serious problems in the colonies due to his sloppy business practices. Apparently, he could not be bothered with administrative details, and his business manager, fellow Quaker Philip Ford, embezzled substantial sums from Penn's estates. Ford capitalised on Penn's habit of signing papers without reading them. One such paper turned out to be a deed transferring ownership of Pennsylvania to Ford who then demanded a rent beyond Penn's ability to pay. 

===Return to America===
[[File:Appletons' Penn William Slate-roof house.jpg|thumb|The [[Slate Roof House]] was one of two residences used by Penn during his second stay in the Americas. The house fell into disrepair and was demolished in 1867.]]
After agreeing to let Ford keep all his Irish rents in exchange for keeping quiet about Ford's legal title to Pennsylvania, Penn felt his situation sufficiently improved to return to Pennsylvania with the intention of staying.<ref>Fantel, p. 237</ref> Accompanied by his wife Hannah, daughter Letitia and secretary [[James Logan (statesman)|James Logan]], Penn sailed from the [[Isle of Wight]] on the ''[[Canterbury (ship)|Canterbury]]'', reaching Philadelphia in December 1699.<ref name= Scharf>Scharf, John Thomas and Thompson Wescott (1884), ''History of Philadelphia, 1609–1884'', Volume II, Philadelphia: L. H. Everts & Co., p. 1686: "In December, 1699, when William Penn made his second visit to Pennsylvania, he brought with him his second wife, Hannah Callowhill Penn, and Letitia Penn, his daughter by his first wife."</ref>

Penn received a hearty welcome upon his arrival and found his province much changed in the intervening 18 years. Pennsylvania was growing rapidly and now had nearly 18,100 inhabitants and Philadelphia over 3,000.<ref name="Miller_3">Miller and Pencak, p. 61</ref> His tree plantings were providing the green urban spaces he had envisioned. Shops were full of imported merchandise, satisfying the wealthier citizens and proving America to be a viable market for English goods. Most importantly, religious diversity was succeeding.<ref>Fantel, p. 240</ref> Despite the protests of fundamentalists and farmers, Penn's insistence that Quaker grammar schools be open to all citizens was producing a relatively educated work force. High literacy and open intellectual discourse led to Philadelphia becoming a leader in science and medicine.<ref>Fantel, p. 242</ref> Quakers were especially modern in their treatment of mental illness, decriminalising insanity and turning away from punishment and confinement.<ref>Fantel, p. 244</ref>

Ironically, the tolerant Penn transformed himself almost into a Puritan, in an attempt to control the fractiousness that had developed in his absence, tightening up some laws.<ref>Fantel, p. 246</ref> Another change was found in Penn's writings, which had mostly lost their boldness and vision. In those years, he did put forward a plan to make a federation of all English colonies in America. There have been claims that he also fought [[slavery]], but that seems unlikely, as he owned and even traded slaves himself and his writings do not support that idea. However, he did promote good treatment for slaves, including marriage among slaves (though rejected by the Council). Other Pennsylvania Quakers were more outspoken and proactive, being among the earliest fighters against slavery in America, led by Daniel Pastorius, founder of [[Germantown, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania|Germantown, Pennsylvania]]. Many Quakers pledged to release their slaves upon their death, including Penn, and some sold their slaves to non-Quakers.<ref>Fantel, p. 251</ref>

The Penns lived comfortably at [[Pennsbury Manor]] and had all intentions of living out their life there. They also had a residence in Philadelphia. Their only American child, John, had been born and was thriving. Penn was commuting to Philadelphia on a six-man barge, which he admitted he prized above "all dead things".

[[James Logan (statesman)|James Logan]], his secretary, kept him acquainted with all the news. Penn had plenty of time to spend with his family and still attend to affairs of state, though delegations and official visitors were frequent. His wife, however, did not enjoy life as a governor's wife and hostess, and preferred the simple life she led in England. When new threats by France again put Penn's charter in jeopardy, Penn decided to return to England with his family, in 1701.<ref>Fantel, p. 253</ref>

===Later years===
Penn returned to England and immediately became embroiled in financial and family troubles. His eldest son [[William Penn, Jr.|William, Jr.]] was leading a dissolute life, neglecting his wife and two children, and running up gambling debts. Penn had hoped to have William succeed him in America.<ref name="Fantel-254">Fantel, p. 254</ref> Now he could not even pay his son's debts. His own finances were in turmoil. He had sunk over £30,000 in America and received little back except some bartered goods. He had made many generous loans which he failed to press.<ref>Fantel, pp. 255–6</ref>

Making matters worse from Penn's perspective, Philip Ford, his financial advisor, had cheated Penn out of thousands of pounds by concealing and diverting rents from Penn's Irish lands, claiming losses, then extracting loans from Penn to cover the shortfall. When Ford died in 1702, his widow Bridget threatened to sell Pennsylvania, to which she claimed title.<ref>Fantel, p. 258</ref> Penn sent William to America to manage affairs, but he proved just as unreliable as he had been in England. There were considerable discussions about scrapping his constitution.<ref>Dobrée, p. 286</ref> In desperation, Penn tried to sell Pennsylvania to the Crown before Bridget Ford got wind of his plan, but by insisting that the Crown uphold the civil liberties that had been achieved, he could not strike a deal. Mrs. Ford took her case to court. At age 62, Penn landed in debtors' prison; however, a rush of sympathy reduced Penn's punishment to house arrest, and Bridget Ford was finally denied her claim to Pennsylvania. A group of Quakers arranged for Ford to receive a payment for back rents and Penn was released.<ref>Fantel, pp. 260–1</ref>

[[File:Friends' Meeting House at Jordans and Wm. Penn's Grave.jpg|thumb|right|Friends' Meeting House at Jordans where Penn is buried]]In 1712 Berkeley Codd, Esq. of [[Sussex County, Delaware]] disputed some of the rights of Penn's grant from the Duke of York. Some of William Penn's agents hired lawyer [[Andrew Hamilton (lawyer)|Andrew Hamilton]] to represent the Penn family in this [[replevin]] case. Hamilton's success led to an established relationship of good will between the Penn family and Andrew Hamilton.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Fisher|first=Joshua Francis|author2=Ffrench, John |author3=Cadwalader, John |author4=Sharpas, William |author5=Alexander, J. |author6= Smith, W. |title=Andrew Hamilton, Esq., of Pennsylvania|journal=The Pennsylvania Magazine of History and Biography|date=April 1892|volume=16|issue=1|page=2}}</ref> Penn had grown weary of the politicking back in Pennsylvania and the restlessness with his governance, but Logan implored him not to forsake his colony, for fear that Pennsylvania might fall into the hands of an opportunist who would undo all the good that had been accomplished.<ref>Dobrée, p. 313</ref> During his second attempt to sell Pennsylvania back to the Crown in 1712, Penn suffered a stroke. A second stroke several months later left him unable to speak or take care of himself. He slowly lost his memory.<ref name="Fantel-254"/>

William Penn died penniless in 1718, at his home in [[Ruscombe]], near [[Twyford, Berkshire|Twyford]] in Berkshire, and is buried in a grave next to his first wife in the cemetery of the [[Jordans, Buckinghamshire|Jordans]] Quaker meeting house near [[Chalfont St Giles]] in Buckinghamshire in England. His wife as sole executor became the de facto proprietor until she died in 1726.<ref>Miller and Pencak, p. 70</ref>

===Family===
Penn first married Gulielma Maria Posthuma Springett (1644–1696), daughter of William S. Springett (the Posthuma in her name indicates that her father had died prior to her birth) and Lady Mary Proude Penington. They had three sons and five daughters:<ref>"Genealogies of Pennsylvania Families"</ref>
*Gulielma Maria (1671/72-before 1685)
*Maria Margaret (born and died 1673/74)
*Springett (1674/75-1696)
*Letitia (1678–1746), who married William Awbrey (Aubrey)
*William, Jr. (1679/80-1720)
*Unnamed child (born and died 1682)
*Gulielma Maria (1685–1689)

Two years after Gulielma's death he married [[Hannah Callowhill Penn|Hannah Margaret Callowhill]] (1671–1726), daughter of Thomas Callowhill and Anna (Hannah) Hollister. William Penn married Hannah when she was 25 and he was 52. They had eight children in twelve years. The first two children died in infancy. The other children were:

* Unnamed daughter (born and died 1697)
* [[John Penn ("the American")|John Penn]] (1699/00–1746), never married.
* [[Thomas Penn]] (1700/01–1775), married Lady Juliana Fermor, fourth daughter of Thomas, first [[Earl of Pomfret]].
* Hannah Penn (1703–1706)
* Margaret Penn (1704/05–1750)
* [[Richard Penn, Sr.]] (1705–1771)
* Dennis Penn (1705/06–1721/22)
* Hannah Penn (1708–1709)
* Louis Penn (1707–1724)

==Legacy==
After Penn's death, Pennsylvania slowly drifted away from a colony founded by religion to a secular state dominated by commerce. Many of Penn's legal and political innovations took root, however, as did the Quaker school in Philadelphia for which Penn issued two charters (1689 and 1701). Sometime later, the institution was renamed the [[William Penn Charter School]]. "Penn Charter", a well-known secondary day school, is now the oldest Quaker school in the world. [[Voltaire]] praised Pennsylvania as the only government in the world responsible to the people and respectful of minority rights. Penn's "Frame of Government" and his other ideas were later studied by [[Benjamin Franklin]] as well as the pamphleteer of the [[American Revolution]], [[Thomas Paine]], whose father was a Quaker. Among Penn's legacies was the unwillingness to force a Quaker majority upon Pennsylvania, allowing his state to develop into a successful "melting pot". In addition, Thomas Jefferson and the founding Fathers adapted Penn's theory of an amendable constitution and his vision that "all Persons are equal under God" in forming the federal government following the [[American Revolution]]. In addition to Penn's extensive political and religious treatises, he wrote nearly 1,000 maxims, full of wise observations about human nature and morality.<ref>William Penn Tercentenary Committee, ''Remember William Penn'', 1944</ref>

Penn's Philadelphia continued to thrive, becoming one of the most populous colonial cities in the [[British Empire]], reaching about 30,000 by the American Revolution, and becoming a center of commerce, science, medicine, and politics.<ref name="Miller_3"/> New groups of immigrants in the 18th century included German-speaking peoples and Scots-Irish.

Penn's family retained ownership of the colony of Pennsylvania until the [[American Revolution]]. However, William's son and successor, [[Thomas Penn]], and his brother [[John Penn ("the American")|John]], renounced their father's faith, and fought to restrict religious freedom (particularly for [[Roman Catholicism|Roman Catholics]] and later [[Quakers]]). Thomas weakened or eliminated the elected assembly's power, and ran the colony instead through his appointed governors. He was a bitter opponent of [[Benjamin Franklin]] and Franklin's push for greater democracy in the years leading up to the revolution. Through the infamous [[Walking Purchase]] of 1737, the Penns cheated the Lenape out of their lands in the [[Lehigh Valley]].<ref>Miller and Pencak, p. 76</ref>

==Posthumous honors==
[[File:Philadelphia City Hall-zoom.JPG|thumb|upright|right|Bronze statue of William Penn atop [[Philadelphia City Hall]]]]
On 28 November 1984 [[Ronald Reagan]], by Presidential Proclamation 5284 (authorised by an [[Act of Congress]]), declared William Penn and his second wife, [[Hannah Callowhill Penn]], each to be an [[Honorary Citizen of the United States]].<ref>[http://www.reagan.utexas.edu/archives/speeches/1984/112884a.htm Proclamation of Honorary US Citizenship for William and Hannah Penn] by President Ronald Reagan (1984)</ref>

A bronze statue of William Penn by [[Alexander Milne Calder]] exists on top of Philadelphia's City Hall.  When installed in 1894, the statue represented the highest point in the city, as City Hall was then the tallest building in Philadelphia. Urban designer [[Edmund Bacon (architect)|Edmund Bacon]] was known to have said that no gentleman would build taller than the "brim of Billy Penn's hat". This agreement existed for almost 100 years until the city decided to allow skyscrapers taller to be built. In March 1987, the completion of [[One Liberty Place]] was the first building to do that. This resulted in a "[[Curse of Billy Penn|curse]]" which lasted from that year on until 2008, when a small statue of William Penn was put on top of the newly built [[Comcast Center (Philadelphia)|Comcast Center]]. The [[Philadelphia Phillies]] went on to win the [[2008 World Series]] that year.

A lesser-known statue of Penn is located at [[Penn Treaty Park]], on the site where Penn entered into his [[Penn's Treaty with the Indians|treaty with the Lenape]]. In 1893, Hajoca Corporation, the nation's largest privately held wholesale distributor of plumbing, heating and industrial supplies, adopted the statue as its trademark symbol.<ref>{{cite web|title=Hajoca Lancaster|url=http://www.hajocalancaster.com/|publisher=Hajoca Lancaster|accessdate=13 October 2015}}</ref>
