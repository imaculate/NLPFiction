'''Richard Price''' (23 February 1723 – 19 April 1791) was a British [[moral philosopher]], [[nonconformist]] preacher and mathematician. He was also a political [[pamphleteer]], active in radical, republican, and liberal causes such as the [[American Revolution]]. He was well-connected and fostered communication between a large number of people, including several of the [[Founding Fathers of the United States]].

Price spent most of his adult life as minister of [[Newington Green Unitarian Church]], on the outskirts of London. He also wrote on issues of [[demography]] and [[finance]], and was a [[Fellow of the Royal Society]].

==Early life==

Richard Price was the son of Rhys Price, a [[English Dissenters|dissenting]] minister. His mother was Catherine Richards, his father's second wife. Richard was born at Tyn Ton, a farmhouse in the village of [[Llangeinor]], [[Glamorgan]], [[Wales]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-22225104|title=Dr Richard Price: The Welshman who influenced US founders|publisher=bbc.co.uk|accessdate=24 June 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.garwheritage.co.uk/wordpress/?p=641|title=Richard Price of Llangeinor|publisher=Gerald Jarvis, Garw Valley Heritage Society, 16 March 2011|accessdate=24 June 2016}}</ref> He was educated privately, then at [[Neath]] and [[Pentwyn, Cardiff|Pen-twyn]].

==Newington Green congregation==
In 1758 Price moved to [[Newington Green]], and took up residence in No. 54 the Green, in the middle of a terrace even then a hundred years old. (The building still survives as London's oldest brick terrace, dated 1658.) Price became minister to the [[Newington Green Unitarian Church|Newington Green meeting-house]], a church that continues today as Newington Green Unitarian Church. Among the congregation were [[Samuel Vaughan]] and his family.<ref>[http://www.amphilsoc.org/mole/view?docId=ead/Mss.B.V462-ead.xml amphilsoc.org, ''John Vaughan papers, 1768 – Circa 1936''.]</ref> Price had [[Thomas Amory (tutor)|Thomas Amory]] as preaching colleague from 1770.<ref>{{cite DNB|wstitle=Amory, Thomas (1701-1774)|display=Amory, Thomas (1701–1774)|volume=1}}</ref>

When, in 1770, Price became morning preacher at the [[Gravel Pit Chapel]] in [[Hackney (parish)|Hackney]], he continued his afternoon sermons at Newington Green. He also accepted duties at the meeting house in Old Jewry.

==Friends and associates==
===Newington Green neighbours===
A close friend of Price was Thomas Rogers, father of [[Samuel Rogers]], a merchant turned banker who had married into a long-established Dissenting family and lived at No. 56 the Green. More than once, Price and the elder Rogers rode on horseback to Wales.<ref name="Thorncroft, p. 15"/> Another was the Rev. [[James Burgh]], author of ''The Dignity of Human Nature'' and ''Thoughts on Education'', who opened his Dissenting Academy on the green in 1750 and sent his pupils to Price's sermons.<ref>Gordon, p. 42.</ref> Price, Rogers, and Burgh formed a dining club, eating at each other's houses in rotation.<ref>Allardyce, p. 23.</ref> Price and Rogers joined the [[Society for Constitutional Information]].<ref>{{cite book|title=English Dissent|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ydw8AAAAIAAJ&pg=PA41|accessdate=16 June 2013|publisher=CUP Archive|pages=41–42|id=GGKEY:UGD38TZ8G4J}}</ref>

===Bowood circle===
The "Bowood circle" was a group of liberal intellectuals around [[Lord Shelburne]], and named after [[Bowood House]], his seat in [[Wiltshire]]. Price met Shelburne in or shortly after 1767,<ref>{{cite book |last=Fruchtman |first=Jack |title=The Apocalyptic Politics of Richard Price and Joseph Priestley: A Study in Late Eighteenth Century English Republican Millennialism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MD4LAAAAIAAJ&pg=PA25|accessdate=16 June 2013|date=1 January 1983|publisher=American Philosophical Society|isbn=978-0-87169-734-9|page=25}}</ref> or was introduced by his wife [[Elizabeth Montagu]], a leader of the [[Blue Stockings Society|Blue Stocking]] intellectual women, after the publication of his ''Four Dissertations'' in that year.<ref name="Holland48">Holland, p. 48.</ref>

==="Club of Honest Whigs"===
The group that [[Benjamin Franklin]] christened the "Club of Honest Whigs" was an informal dining group around [[John Canton]]. It met originally in [[St Paul's Churchyard]], at the [[English coffeehouses in the 17th and 18th centuries|London Coffee House]]; in 1771 it moved to [[Ludgate Hill]]. Price and [[John Pringle (physician)|Sir John Pringle]] were members, as were Priestley and Benjamin Vaughan.<ref>{{cite book |last=Wood |first=Paul |title=Science and Dissent in England, 1688–1945|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vPWTn9DNBMEC&pg=PA120|accessdate=16 June 2013|year=2004|publisher=Ashgate Publishing, Ltd.|isbn=978-0-7546-3718-9|page=120}}</ref>

===Visitors===
At home, or at his church itself, Price was visited by Franklin, [[Thomas Jefferson]], and [[Thomas Paine]];<ref>Graham, p. 131.</ref> other American politicians such as Ambassador [[John Adams]], who later became the second [[president of the United States]], and his wife [[Abigail Adams|Abigail]]; and British politicians such as [[George Lyttelton, 1st Baron Lyttelton|Lord Lyttleton]], [[Charles Stanhope, 3rd Earl Stanhope|Earl Stanhope]] (known as "Citizen Stanhope"), and [[William Pitt, 1st Earl of Chatham|William Pitt the Elder]]. He knew also the philosophers [[David Hume]] and [[Adam Smith]]. Among activists, the prison reformer [[John Howard (prison reformer)|John Howard]] counted Price as a close friend;<ref>{{cite book |last=Throness |first=Laurie |title=A Protestant Purgatory: Theological Origins of the Penitentiary Act, 1779|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jI-Iqtv-kU8C&pg=PA131|accessdate=18 June 2013|year=2008|publisher=Ashgate Publishing, Ltd.|isbn=978-0-7546-6392-8|pages=131–}}</ref> also there were [[John Horne Tooke]], and [[John Jebb (1736–1786)|John]] and [[Ann Jebb]].<ref name="Thorncroft, p. 15">Thorncroft, p. 15.</ref>

===Theologians===
[[File:Repeal of the Test Act Sayers.jpg|thumb|left|Joseph Priestley, Richard Price and Theophilus Lindsay in the pulpit, in a 1790 engraving satirising the campaign to have the [[Test Act]] repealed]]
Others acknowledged their debt to Price, such as the Unitarian theologians [[William Ellery Channing]] and [[Theophilus Lindsey]]. When Lindsey resigned his living and moved to London to create an avowedly Unitarian congregation Price played a role in finding and securing the premises for what became [[Essex Street Chapel]].<ref>[http://www.unitarian.org.uk/support/doc-EssexHall2.shtml chapter 2 ''The History of Essex Hall'' by Mortimer Rowe B.A., D.D.

Price and Priestley took diverging views on morals and [[metaphysics]]. In 1778 appeared a published correspondence, ''A Free Discussion on the Doctrines of Materialism and Philosophical Necessity''. Price maintained, in opposition to Priestley, the free agency of man and the unity and immateriality of the human soul. Price's opinions were [[Arianism|Arian]], Priestley's were [[socinianism|Socinian]].<ref>{{cite book |last=Botting |first=Eileen Hunt |title=Family Feuds: Wollstonecraft, Burke, and Rousseau on the Transformation of the Family|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DIirNHqjUqwC&pg=PA158|accessdate=17 June 2013|date=May 2007|publisher=SUNY Press|isbn=978-0-7914-6706-0|page=158}}</ref>

===Mary Wollstonecraft===
[[File:Mary Wollstonecraft by John Opie (c. 1797).jpg|right|thumb|[[Mary Wollstonecraft]] (c. 1797)]]
[[Mary Wollstonecraft]] moved her fledgling school for girls from [[Islington]] to Newington Green in 1784,<ref>Jacobs, p. 38.</ref> with patron Mrs Burgh, widow of Price's friend James Burgh.<ref>Gordon, p. 46.</ref> Wollstonecraft, originally an [[Anglican]], attended Price's services, where believers of all kinds were welcomed.<ref name="Tomalin, p. 60">Tomalin, p. 60.</ref> The [[Rational Dissenters]] appealed to Wollstonecraft: they were hard-working, humane, critical but uncynical, and respectful towards women,<ref>Tomalin, p. 51.</ref> and proved kinder to her than her own family.<ref name="Tomalin, p. 60"/> Price is believed to have helped her with money to go to [[Lisbon]] to see her close friend Fanny Blood.<ref>Gordon, p. 48.</ref>

Wollstonecraft was then unpublished: through Price she met the radical publisher [[Joseph Johnson (publisher)|Joseph Johnson]]. The ideas Wollstonecraft ingested from the sermons at Newington Green pushed her towards a political awakening.<ref>Gordon, pp. 51 passim.</ref> She later published ''[[A Vindication of the Rights of Men]]'' (1790), a response to [[Edmund Burke|Burke]]'s denunciation of the French Revolution and attack on Price; and ''[[A Vindication of the Rights of Woman]]'' (1792), extending Price's arguments about equality to women: [[Claire Tomalin|Tomalin]] argues that just as the Dissenters were "excluded as a class from education and civil rights by a lazy-minded majority", so too were women, and the "character defects of both groups" could be attributed to this discrimination.<ref>Tomalin, p. 61.</ref> Price appears 14 times in the diary of [[William Godwin]], Wollstonecraft's later husband.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://godwindiary.bodleian.ox.ac.uk/people/PRI02.html|title=Person record for Price,    Richard|author=|date=|website=godwindiary.bodleian.ox.ac.uk|accessdate=8 April 2018}}</ref>

== The American Revolution ==
The support Price gave to the colonies of [[British North America]] in the [[American War of Independence]] made him famous. In early 1776 he published ''Observations on the Nature of Civil Liberty, the Principles of Government, and the Justice and Policy of the War with America''. Sixty thousand copies of this pamphlet were sold within days; and a cheap edition was issued which sold twice as many copies.<ref name=plumb>[[J. H. Plumb]], ''England in the Eighteenth Century'', (Middlesex: Penguin Books Ltd, 1950)</ref> It commended Shelburne's proposals for the colonies, and attacked the [[Declaratory Act]].<ref>{{cite book|author1=Jack P.

He was presented with the [[freedom of the city]] of London, and it is said that his pamphlet had a part in determining the Americans to [[American Declaration of Independence|declare their independence]].<ref name = plumb /> A second pamphlet on the war with America and the debts of [[Great Britain]], followed in the spring of 1777.<ref name="EB1911"/>

Price's name became identified with the cause of American independence. [[Benjamin Franklin|Franklin]] was a close friend; Price corresponded with [[Anne Robert Jacques Turgot, Baron de Laune|Turgot]]; and in the winter of 1778 he was invited by the [[Continental Congress]] to go to America and assist in the financial administration of the states, an offer he turned down. In 1781 he, solely with [[George Washington]], received the degree of [[Doctor of Laws]] from [[Yale University|Yale College]].<ref name="EB1911"/> He preached to crowded congregations, and, when Lord Shelburne became Prime Minister in 1782, he was offered the post of his private secretary. The same year he was elected a Foreign Honorary Member of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]].<ref name=AAAS>{{cite web|title=Book of Members, 1780–2010: Chapter P|url=http://www.amacad.org/publications/BookofMembers/ChapterP.pdf|publisher=American Academy of Arts and Sciences|accessdate=28 July 2014}}</ref>

Price wrote also ''Observations on the importance of the [[American Revolution]] and the means of rendering it a benefit to the World'' (1784). Well received by Americans, it suggested that the greatest problem facing Congress was its lack of central powers.<ref>Graham, p. 49.</ref>

==French Revolution controversy==
[[File:Smelling out a rat.jpg|thumb|left|''Smelling out a Rat'', a caricature of Price with [[Edmund Burke]]'s vision looking over his shoulder, by [[James Gillray]], 1790.]]
Both Price and Priestley, who were [[millennialists]], saw the [[French Revolution]]  of 1789 as fulfilment of prophecy.<ref>{{cite book |last=Landes |first=Richard |title=Heaven on Earth:The Varieties of the Millennial Experience|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-ly08wDNPVcC&pg=PA250|accessdate=17 June 2013|date=7 July 2011|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-983181-4|pages=250–51}}</ref> On the 101st anniversary of the [[Glorious Revolution]], 4 November 1789, Price preached a [[sermon]] entitled ''[[A Discourse on the Love of Our Country]]'', and ignited the pamphlet war known as the [[Revolution Controversy]], on the political issues raised by the French Revolution. Price drew a bold parallel between the Glorious Revolution of 1688 (the one celebrated by the London Revolution Society dinner) and the French Revolution of 1789, arguing that the former had spread enlightened ideas and paved the way for the second one. Price exhorted the public to divest themselves of national prejudices and embrace "universal benevolence", a concept of cosmopolitanism that entailed support for the French Revolution and the progress of "enlightened" ideas.<ref>On Price's ''Discourse on the Love of Our Country'', see: Rémy Duthille, [http://www.english.qmul.ac.uk/drwilliams/journal/issues/28%282012%29.pdf#page=33 “Richard Price on Patriotism and Universal Benevolence”, ''Enlightenment and Dissent'', 28 (2012), pp. 24–41.]</ref> It has been called "one of the great political debates in British history".<ref>{{cite book |last=Crowe |first=Ian |title=An Imaginative Whig: Reassessing the Life and Thought of Edmund Burke|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=a3-oIBwZvFcC&pg=PA93|accessdate=17 June 2013|year=2005|publisher=University of Missouri Press|isbn=978-0-8262-6419-0|page=93}}</ref> At the dinner of the London Revolution Society that followed, Price also suggested that the Society should send an address to the [[National Assembly (French Revolution)|National Assembly]] in Paris.<ref>Graham, p. 136.</ref>  This was the start of a correspondence with many Jacobin clubs in Paris and elsewhere in France. Though the London Revolution Society and the Jacobin clubs agreed on basic tenets, their correspondence displayed a sense of growing misunderstanding as the French Jacobins grew more radical and their British correspondents, including Price, were not prepared to condone political violence.<ref>On the French reception of Price's ''Discourse'' and the Revolution Society, see {{cite book |first=Rémy |last=Duthille |chapter=1688–1789.

Burke's rebuttal in ''[[Reflections on the Revolution in France]]'' (1790) attacked Price, whose friends Paine and Wollstonecraft leapt into the fray to defend their mentor; [[William Coxe (historian)|William Coxe]] was another opponent, disagreeing with Price on interpretation of "our country".<ref>{{cite book |last=Clark |first=J.

His extended family included [[William Morgan (actuary)|William Morgan]], the actuary, and his brother [[George Cadogan Morgan]] (1754–1798), dissenting minister and scientist, both sons of Richard Price's sister Sarah by William Morgan, a surgeon of [[Bridgend]], [[Glamorganshire]].

==Publications==
In 1744 Price published a volume of sermons.<ref name="EB1911"/> It was, however, as a writer on financial and political questions that Price became widely known. Price rejected traditional Christian notions of [[original sin]] and moral punishment, preaching the perfectibility of human nature,<ref>Gordon, p. 50.</ref> and he wrote on theological questions. He also wrote on [[finance]], [[economics]], [[probability]], and [[life insurance]].

===Thomas Bayes===
Price was asked to become [[literary executor]] of [[Thomas Bayes]] the mathematician.<ref name="Holland46">Holland, pp. 46–47.</ref> He edited Bayes's major work ''[[An Essay towards solving a Problem in the Doctrine of Chances]]'' (1763), which appeared in ''[[Philosophical Transactions]]'', and contains [[Bayes' Theorem]], one of the fundamental results of [[probability theory]].<ref>{{cite book |last=Allen |first=Richard |title=David Hartley on Human Nature|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NCu6HhGlAB8C&pg=PA243|accessdate=16 June 2013|year=1999|publisher=SUNY Press|isbn=978-0-7914-9451-6|pages=243–44}}</ref> Price wrote an introduction to the paper which provides some of the philosophical basis of [[Bayesian statistics]].

===Demographer===
[[File:Price - Observations on reversionary payments, 1772 - 328.tif|thumb|''Observations on reversionary payments'', 1772.]]
From about 1766 Price worked with the [[The Equitable Life Assurance Society|Society for Equitable Assurances]].<ref name="ODNB 22761"/> In 1769, in a letter to [[Benjamin Franklin]], he made some observations on [[life expectancy]], and the population of London, which were published in the ''Philosophical Transactions'' of that year.<ref name="EB1911"/> Price's views included the detrimental effects of large cities, and the need for some constraints on commerce and movement of population.<ref>{{cite book |last=Claeys |first=Gregory |title=Citizens and Saints: Politics and Anti-Politics in Early British Socialism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Q-nWgJFb-CgC&pg=PA32|accessdate=17 June 2013|year=1989|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-36490-4|page=32}}</ref>

In May 1770 Price presented to the Royal Society a paper on the proper method of calculating the values of contingent reversions. His book ''Observations on Reversionary Payments'' (1771) became a classic, in use for about a century, and providing the basis for financial calculations of insurance and benefit societies, of which many had recently been formed.<ref name="Holland46"/> The "Northampton table", a [[life table]] compiled by Price with data from [[Northampton]], became standard for about a century in actuarial work.

Price wrote a further ''Essay on the Population of England'' (2nd ed., 1780) which influenced [[Thomas Robert Malthus]]. His continuing claim in it on British depopulation was challenged by [[John Howlett (political economist)|John Howlett]] in 1781.<ref>{{cite ODNB|id=14002|title=Howlett, John|first=R.

===Public finance===
In 1771 Price published his ''Appeal to the Public on the Subject of the National Debt'' (ed. 1772 and 1774). This pamphlet excited considerable controversy, and is supposed to have influenced [[William Pitt the Younger]] in re-establishing the [[sinking fund]] for the extinction of the [[national debt]], created by [[Robert Walpole]] in 1716 and abolished in 1733. The means proposed for the extinction of the debt are described by [[Lord Overstone]] as "a sort of hocus-pocus machinery," supposed to work "without loss to any one," and consequently unsound.<ref name="EB1911"/> Price's views were attacked by [[John Brand (political writer)|John Brand]] in 1776.<ref>{{cite DNB|wstitle=Brand, John (d.1808)|display=Brand, John (d.1808)|volume=6}}</ref> When Brand returned to finance and fiscal matters, ''Alteration of the Constitution of the House of Commons and the Inequality of the Land Tax'' (1793), he used work of Price, among others.<ref>{{cite ODNB|id=3255|title=Brand, John|first=R.

===Moral philosophy===
The ''Review of the Principal Questions in Morals'' (1758, 3rd ed. revised 1787) contains Price's theory of [[ethics]]. The work is supposedly a refutation of [[Francis Hutcheson (philosopher)|Francis Hutcheson]].<ref name="EB1911"/> Price represented a different tradition, [[deontological ethics]] rather than the [[virtue ethics]] of Hutcheson, going back to [[Samuel Clarke]] and [[John Balguy]].<ref>{{cite book |editor=Terence Cuneo |editor2=René van Woudenberg |title=The Cambridge Companion to Thomas Reid |year=2004 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=0-521-01208-2 |page=247}}</ref> The book is divided into ten chapters, the first of which gives his main ethical theory, allied to that of [[Ralph Cudworth]].

[[J. G. A. Pocock]] comments that Price was a moralist first, putting morality well ahead of democratic attachments. He was widely criticised for that and an absence of interest in [[civil society]]. As well as Burke, [[John Adams]], [[Adam Ferguson]] and [[Josiah Tucker]] wrote against him.<ref name="PocockSchochet1996">{{cite book|author1=J. G. A. Pocock|author2=Gordon J.

For Price, right and wrong belong to actions in themselves, and he rejects [[consequentialism]]. This ethical value is perceived by [[reason]] or understanding, which intuitively recognizes fitness or congruity between actions, agents and total circumstances. Arguing that ethical judgment is an act of discrimination, he endeavours to invalidate [[moral sense theory]]. He admits that right actions must be "grateful" to us; that, in fact, moral approbation includes both an act of the understanding and an emotion of the heart. Still it remains true that reason alone, in its highest development, would be a sufficient guide. In this conclusion he is in close agreement with Kant; reason is the arbiter, and right is

# not a matter of the emotions and
# no relative to imperfect human nature.<ref name="EB1911"/>

Price's main point of difference with Cudworth is that while Cudworth regards the moral criterion as a νόημα or modification of the mind, existing in germ and developed by circumstances, Price regards it as acquired from the contemplation of actions, but acquired necessarily, immediately intuitively. In his view of disinterested action (ch. iii.) he follows Butler. Happiness he regards as the only end, conceivable by us, of [[divine Providence]], but it is a happiness wholly dependent on rectitude. Virtue tends always to happiness, and in the end must produce it in its perfect form.<ref name="EB1911"/>

===Other works===
Price also wrote ''Fast-day Sermons'', published respectively in 1779 and 1781. Throughout the American War, Price preached sermons on fast-days and took the opportunity to attack Britain's coercive policies toward the colonies.<ref>[http://www.c-s-p.org/flyers/978-1-4438-0546-9-sample.pdf Rémy Duthille, “Dissent against the American War : The Politics of Richard Price’s Sermons”, in ''War Sermons'', Gilles Teulié and Laurence Lux-Sterritt, Newcastle upon Tyne: Cambridge Scholars Publishing, 2009, pp. 149–72.]</ref> A complete list of his works was given as an appendix to Priestley's ''Funeral Sermon''.<ref name="EB1911"/>
