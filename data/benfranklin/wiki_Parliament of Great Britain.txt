The '''Parliament of Great Britain''' was formed in 1707 following the ratification of the [[Acts of Union 1707|Acts of Union]] by both the [[Parliament of England]] and the [[Parliament of Scotland]].  The Acts created a new unified [[Kingdom of Great Britain]] and dissolved the separate English and Scottish parliaments in favour of a single parliament, located in the former home of the English parliament in the [[Palace of Westminster]], near the [[City of London]]. This lasted nearly a century, until the [[Acts of Union 1800]] merged the separate British and Irish Parliaments into a single [[Parliament of the United Kingdom]] with effect from 1 January 1801.

== Origins ==
Following the [[Treaty of Union]] in 1706, [[Acts of Union 1707|Acts of Union]] ratifying the Treaty were passed in both the Parliament of England and the Parliament of Scotland, which created a new Kingdom of Great Britain.<ref>[http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/pathways/citizenship/rise_parliament/uniting.htm Uniting the kingdom?] nationalarchives.gov.uk, accessed 18 January 2011</ref><ref>[http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/vli/visitingHolyrood/union_exhibition.pdf Making the Act of Union 1707] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110511140052/http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/vli/visitingHolyrood/union_exhibition.pdf |date=May 11, 2011 }} scottish.parliament.uk, accessed 18 January 2011</ref> The Acts dissolved both parliaments, replacing them with a new parliament, referred to as the 'Parliament of Great Britain', based in the home of the former English parliament. All of the traditions, procedures, and standing orders of the English parliament were retained, as were the incumbent officers, and members representing England comprised the overwhelming majority of the new body. It was not even considered necessary to hold a new general election. While [[Scots law]] and Scottish legislation remained separate, new legislation was thereafter to be enacted by the new parliament.<ref>[[s:Act of Union 1707|Act of Union 1707]], Article 1</ref>

After the [[House of Hanover|Hanoverian]] [[George I of Great Britain|King George I]] ascended the British throne in 1714 through the [[Act of Settlement 1701|Act of Settlement]] of 1701, real power continued to shift away from the monarchy. George was a [[Germans|German]] ruler, spoke poor English, and remained interested in governing his dominions in continental Europe rather than in Britain. He thus entrusted power to a group of his ministers, the foremost of whom was [[Robert Walpole|Sir Robert Walpole]], and by the end of his reign in 1727 the position of the ministers — who had to rely on Parliament for support — was cemented. George I's successor, his son [[George II of Great Britain|George II]], continued to follow through with his father's domestic policies and made little effort to re-establish monarchical control over the government which was now in firm control by Parliament. By the end of the 18th century the monarch still had considerable influence over Parliament, which was dominated by the English aristocracy, by means of [[patronage]], but had ceased to exert direct power: for instance, the last occasion on which the [[Royal Assent]] was withheld was in 1708 by [[Anne, Queen of Great Britain|Queen Anne]].<ref>{{Cite book| last = Black | first = Jeremy | title = Parliament and Foreign Policy in the Eighteenth Century | publisher = [[Cambridge University Press]] | year = 2004 | location = England | pages = 21 | url = https://books.google.com/?id=cWGk4-59GGIC&pg=PA21&dq=british+royal+veto+1708 | isbn = 0-521-83331-0 }}</ref> At [[general election]]s the vote was restricted to [[Freehold (law)|freeholders]] and landowners, in constituencies that had changed little since the [[Middle Ages]], so that in many [[Rotten and pocket boroughs|"rotten" and "pocket" boroughs]] seats could be bought, while major cities remained unrepresented, except by the [[Knights of the Shire]] representing whole counties. Reformers and [[Radicalism (historical)|Radicals]] sought parliamentary reform, but as the [[French Revolutionary Wars]] developed the British government became repressive against dissent and progress towards reform was stalled.

George II's successor, [[George III of the United Kingdom|George III]], sought to restore royal supremacy and absolute monarchy, but by the end of his reign the position of the king's ministers — who discovered that they needed the support of Parliament to enact any major changes — had become central to the role of British governance, and would remain so ever after.

During the first half of George III's reign, the monarch still had considerable influence over Parliament, which itself was dominated by the patronage and influence of the English nobility. Most candidates for the House of Commons were identified as [[Whigs (British political party)|Whigs]] or [[Tories (British political party)|Tories]], but once elected they formed shifting coalitions of interests rather than dividing along clear party lines. At [[general election]]s the vote was restricted in most places to property owners, in constituencies which were out of date and did not reflect the growing importance of manufacturing towns or shifts of population, so that in the rotten and pocket boroughs seats in parliament could be bought from the rich landowners who controlled them, while major cities remained unrepresented. Reformers like [[William Beckford (politician)|William Beckford]] and [[Radicalism (historical)|Radicals]] beginning with [[John Wilkes]] called for reform of the system. In 1780, a draft programme of reform was drawn up by [[Charles James Fox]] and [[Thomas Brand Hollis]] and put forward by a sub-committee of the electors of Westminster. This included calls for the six points later adopted by the [[Chartism|Chartist]]s.

The [[American Revolutionary War]] ended in the defeat of a foreign policy seeking to forcibly restore the thirteen American colonies to British rule which [[George III of the United Kingdom|King George III]] had fervently advocated, and in March 1782 the king was forced to appoint an administration led by his opponents which sought to curb royal patronage. In November 1783 he took the opportunity to use his influence in the [[House of Lords]] to defeat a bill to reform the British [[East India Company]], dismissed the government of the day, and appointed [[William Pitt the Younger]] to form a new government. Pitt had previously called for Parliament to begin to reform itself, but he did not press for long for reforms the king did not like. Proposals Pitt made in April 1785 to redistribute seats from the "rotten boroughs" to London and the counties were defeated in the House of Commons by 248 votes to 174.

In the wake of the [[French Revolution]] of 1789, [[Radicalism (historical)|Radical]] organisations such as the [[London Corresponding Society]] sprang up to press for parliamentary reform, but as the [[French Revolutionary Wars]] developed the government took extensive repressive measures against feared domestic unrest aping the democratic and egalitarian ideals of the French Revolution and progress toward reform was stalled for decades.

== Parliament of the United Kingdom ==
In 1801, the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom]] was created when the [[Kingdom of Great Britain]] was merged with the [[Kingdom of Ireland]] to become the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland]] under the [[Acts of Union 1800]].
