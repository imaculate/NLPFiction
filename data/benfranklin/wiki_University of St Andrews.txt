The '''University of St Andrews''' ({{lang-sco|University o St Andras}}; abbreviated as '''St And''', from the [[Latin language|Latin]] ''Sancti Andreae'', in [[post-nominals]]) is a British [[public university]] in [[St Andrews]], [[Fife]], Scotland. It is the [[List of oldest universities in continuous operation|oldest]] of the four [[ancient universities of Scotland]] and the third oldest university in the English-speaking world (following [[Oxford University|Oxford]] and [[Cambridge University|Cambridge]] universities). St Andrews was founded between 1410 and 1413, when the [[Avignon Pope|Avignon]] [[Antipope Benedict XIII]] issued a [[papal bull]] to a small founding group of [[Augustinian]] clergy.

St Andrews is made up of a variety of institutions, comprising three colleges – [[United College, St Andrews|United College]] (a union of St Salvator's and St Leonard's Colleges), [[St Mary's College, St Andrews|St Mary's College]], and [[St Leonard's College (University of St Andrews)|St Leonard's College]], the last named being a non-statutory revival of St Leonard's as a post-graduate society. There are 18 academic schools organised into four faculties.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/about/governance|title= University of St Andrews: Governance|accessdate=10 August 2014|publisher= University of St Andrews}}</ref> The university occupies historic and modern buildings located throughout the town.

The university was founded in 1410 when a group of [[Augustinian]] [[clergy]], driven from [[the University of Paris]] by the [[Western schism|Avignon schism]] and from the universities of [[Oxford University|Oxford]] and [[Cambridge University|Cambridge]] by the [[Anglo-Scottish Wars]], formed a society of higher learning in St Andrews, which offered courses of lectures in divinity, logic, philosophy, and law. A [[charter]] of privilege was bestowed upon the society of masters and scholars by the [[Bishop of St Andrews]], [[Henry Wardlaw]], on 28 February 1411.<ref name="Meadieval university">{{cite web|title=Meadieval university|url=http://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/media/court-office/documents/medieval_university.pdf|accessdate=3 January 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130722053757/http://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/media/court-office/documents/medieval_university.pdf|archivedate=22 July 2013|df=dmy-all}}</ref> Wardlaw then successfully petitioned the [[Avignon Pope Benedict XIII]] to grant the school university status by issuing a series of [[papal bull]]s, which followed on 28 August 1413.<ref name="Scotland1837">{{cite book|author=Great Britain.

A college of [[theology]] and [[Humanities|arts]] called [[St John's College, St Andrews|St John's College]] was founded in 1418<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gashe.ac.uk/isaar/P0243.html |title=Lindores, Lawrence of, ? 1372–1437, Rector, University of St Andrews, Scotland |publisher=Gashe.ac.uk |date=15 August 2002 |accessdate=17 April 2011 }}{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> by Robert of Montrose and Lawrence of Lindores.

St John's College was refounded by Cardinal [[James Beaton]] under the name [[St Mary's College, St Andrews|St Mary's College]] in 1538 for the study of divinity and law. It was intended to encourage traditional Catholic teachings in opposition to the emerging [[Scottish Reformation]], but once Scotland had formally split with the [[Papacy]] in 1560, it became a teaching institution for Protestant clergy.<ref name="Beaton, James, d 1539, Archbishop of St Andrews">{{cite web|title=Beaton, James, d 1539, Archbishop of St Andrews|url=http://www.gashe.ac.uk/isaar/P0209.html|accessdate=3 January 2013}}{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> Some university buildings that date from this period are still in use today, such as [[St Salvator's Chapel]], St Leonard's College Chapel and St Mary's College quadrangle. At this time, the majority of the teaching was of a religious nature and was conducted by clerics associated with the [[St Andrew's Cathedral, St Andrews|cathedral]].

===Development===
During the 17th and 18th centuries, the university had mixed fortunes and was often beset by civil and religious disturbances. In a particularly acute depression in 1747, severe financial problems triggered the dissolution of St Leonard's College, whose properties and staff were merged into St Salvator's College to form the [[United College, St Andrews|United College of St Salvator and St Leonard]].<ref name="Meadieval university" /> Throughout this period student numbers were very low; for instance, when [[Samuel Johnson]] visited the university in 1773, the university had fewer than 100 pupils, and was in his opinion in a steady decline. He described it as "pining in decay and struggling for life".<ref name="gutenberg.org">{{cite web|url=http://www.gutenberg.org/files/2064/2064-h/2064-h.htm |title=A Journey to the Western Isles of Scotland |publisher=Gutenberg.org |date=20 April 2005 |accessdate=17 April 2011}}</ref> The poverty of Scotland during this period also damaged St Andrews, as few were able to patronise the university and its colleges, and with state support being improbable, the income they received was scarce.

===Modern period===

In the second half of the 19th century, pressure was building upon universities to open up higher education to women.<ref name="Discovery in archives">{{cite web|title=Discovery in archives sheds new light on Jex-Blake's campaign for medical education for women|url=https://standrewsrarebooks.wordpress.com/2012/02/27/discovery-in-archives-sheds-new-light-on-jex-blakes-campaign-for-medical-education-for-women/}}</ref> In 1876, the University Senate decided to allow women to receive an education at St Andrews at a level roughly equal to the [[MA (Scotland)|Master of Arts degree]] that men were able to take at the time. The scheme came to be known as the '[[Lady Literate in Arts|LLA examination]]' (Lady Literate in Arts). It required women to pass five subjects at an ordinary level and one at honours level and entitled them to hold a degree from the university.<ref name="Ladies Literate in Arts">{{cite web|title=Ladies Literate in Arts|url=http://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/library/specialcollections/didyouknow/lla/|accessdate=2 January 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120620201913/http://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/library/specialcollections/didyouknow/lla/|archivedate=20 June 2012|df=dmy-all}}</ref> In 1889 the [[Ancient university governance in Scotland|Universities (Scotland) Act]]<ref name="Universities (Scotland) Act 1889">{{cite web|title=Universities (Scotland) Act 1889|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/Vict/52-53/55/contents|accessdate=2 January 2013}}</ref> made it possible to formally admit women to St Andrews and to receive an education equal to that of male students. Agnes Forbes Blackadder became the first woman to graduate from St Andrews on the same level as men in October 1894, gaining her MA. She entered the university in 1892, making St Andrews the first university in Scotland to admit female undergraduates on the same level as men.<ref name="Who was the first female graduate of the University of St Andrews?">{{cite web|title=Who was the first female graduate of the University of St Andrews?|url=http://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/library/specialcollections/didyouknow/femalegraduate/|accessdate=2 January 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130110152020/http://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/library/specialcollections/didyouknow/femalegraduate/|archivedate=10 January 2013|df=dmy-all}}</ref> In response to the increasing number of female students attending the university, the first women's hall was built in 1896 and was named University Hall.<ref name="Literate Ladies – A fifty year experiment">{{cite web|url=http://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/media/special-collections/documents/Literate%20Ladies%20Alumnus%20Chronicle%20vol%2059%20June%201968.pdf|title=Literate Ladies – A fifty year experiment|accessdate=2 January 2013}}</ref>

Up until the start of the 20th century, St Andrews offered a traditional education based on classical languages, divinity and philosophical studies, and was slow to embrace more practical fields such as science and medicine that were becoming more popular at other universities. In response to the need for modernisation and in order to increase student numbers and alleviate financial problems, the university merged with [[University of Dundee|University College, Dundee]] in 1897, which had a focus on scientific and professional subjects. After the incorporation of University College Dundee, St Andrews' various problems generally receded. Of note is that, up until 1967, many students who obtained a degree from the University of St Andrews had in fact spent most, and sometimes all, of their undergraduate career based in Dundee.

[[File:University of St Andrews Gateway.JPG|thumb|left|The "Gateway" building, built in 2000 and now used for the university's management department]]

As the 20th century progressed, it became increasingly popular among the Scottish upper classes to send their children to the country's oldest higher learning institution,{{citation needed|date=August 2016}} and the university's student population rose sharply.{{tone inline|date=August 2016}} This revival has been maintained to the present day.{{tone inline|date=August 2016}} Despite this, there have been some notable changes.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}} In 1967, the union with University College Dundee ended, when that College became an independent institution under the name of the [[University of Dundee]]. As a result of this, St Andrews lost its capacity to provide degrees in many areas such as Law, Accountancy, Dentistry and Engineering, while it also lost the right to confer the undergraduate medical degree MBChB. However, the university has prospered in other ways.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}{{tone inline|date=August 2016}} In 1972, the College of St Leonard was reconstituted as a postgraduate institute.<ref name="St leonards college">{{cite web|title=St leonards college|url=http://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/pgstudents/stleonards/|accessdate=3 January 2013}}</ref>

===Links with the United States===

St Andrews' historical links with the [[United States]] predate the country's independence. [[James Wilson]], a signer of the [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]], attended (but did not graduate from) St Andrews. Wilson one of six original justices appointed by [[George Washington]] to the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] and was a founder of the [[University of Pennsylvania Law School]]. Other prominent American figures associated with St Andrews include [[Scottish American]] industrialist [[Andrew Carnegie]], who was elected [[Rector of the University of St Andrews|Rector]] in 1901 and whose name is given to the prestigious [[Carnegie Trust for the Universities of Scotland|Carnegie Scholarship]], and [[Edward Harkness]], an American philanthropist who in 1930 provided for the construction of [[St Salvator's Hall]]. American [[Bobby Jones (golfer)|Bobby Jones]], co-founder of the [[Augusta National Golf Club]] and the [[Masters Tournament]], was named a [[Freedom of the City|Freeman of the City]] of St Andrews in 1958, becoming only the second American to be so honored, the other being Benjamin Franklin in 1759.<ref name="Citizen Jones">{{cite news|title=Citizen Jones|url=http://www.golfdigest.com/magazine/bobbyjones|accessdate=11 August 2014}}</ref> Today a highly competitive scholarship exchange, The Robert T. Jones Scholarship, exists between St Andrews and [[Emory University]] in [[Atlanta]].

==Governance and administration==
[[File:University of St Andrews Courtyard.jpg|thumb|Courtyard of the United College]]
{{Main article|Governance of the University of St Andrews}}

As with the other ancient universities of Scotland, the governance of the university is determined by the [[Universities (Scotland) Act 1858]]. This Act created three bodies: the [[General Council (Scottish university)|General Council]], [[University Court]] and [[Academic Senate]] (''Senatus Academicus'').

===General Council===
{{Main article|General Council of St Andrews University}}
The General Council is a standing advisory body of all the [[Alumnus|graduates]], academics and former academics of the university. It meets twice a year and appoints a business committee to manage business between these meetings. Its most important functions are to appoint two [[Assessor (law)|assessors]] to the [[University Court]] and elect the university's [[Chancellor of the University of St Andrews|chancellor]].

===University Court===
[[File:Castle House - geograph.org.uk - 1041518.jpg|thumbnail|left|School of English]]
The [[University Court]] is the body responsible for administrative and financial matters, and is in effect the governing body of the university. It is chaired by the [[Rector (academia)|rector]], who is elected by the [[matriculation|matriculated]] students of the University. Members are appointed by the General Council, [[Academic Senate]] and Fife Council. The President of the [[University of St Andrews Students' Association|Students' Association]] and Director of Representation are ''ex officio'' members of the Court. Several [[Laity|lay]] members are also co-opted and must include a fixed number of alumni of the University.

===''Senatus Academicus''===
The [[Academic Senate]] (Latin ''Senatus Academicus'') is the supreme academic body for the university. Its members include all the professors of the university, certain senior [[Reader (academic rank)|readers]], a number of [[senior lecturer]]s and [[lecturer]]s and three elected student senate representatives – one from the arts and divinity faculty, one from the science and medicine faculty and one postgraduate student. It is responsible for authorising degree programmes and issuing all degrees to graduates, and for managing student discipline. The President of the Senate is the [[University Principal]].

===Office of the Principal===
The [[Principal of the University of St Andrews|Principal]] is the chief executive of the university and is assisted in that role by several key officers, including the Deputy Principal, [[Master of the United College]] and [[Quaestor (University of St Andrews)|Quaestor]]. The principal has responsibility for the overall running of the university and presides over the University Senate.<ref name="Office of the Principal">{{cite web|title=Office of the Principal|url=http://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/administration/principalsoffice/|accessdate=3 January 2013}}</ref>

===Rector===
{{Main article|Rector of the University of St Andrews}}

In Scotland, the position of rector exists at the four [[ancient universities]] (St Andrews, [[Glasgow University|Glasgow]], [[Aberdeen University|Aberdeen]] and [[Edinburgh University|Edinburgh]]) – as well as the [[University of Dundee]]. The post was made an integral part of these universities by the Universities (Scotland) Act 1889. The Rector of the University of St Andrews chairs meetings of the University Court, the governing body of the university; and is elected by the matriculated student body to ensure that their needs are adequately considered by the university's leadership. Through St Andrews' history a number of notable people have been elected to the post, including the actor [[John Cleese]], industrialist and philanthropist [[Andrew Carnegie]], author and poet [[Rudyard Kipling]] and the [[British Prime Minister]] [[Archibald Primrose, 5th Earl of Rosebery]].<ref name="The rector of the university">{{cite web|title=The rector of the university|url=https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/about/governance/therector/https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/about/governance/therector/|accessdate=3 January 2013}}{{Dead link|date=July 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>

===Colleges===
The university encompasses three [[college]]s:  [[United College, St Andrews|United College]], [[St Mary's College, St Andrews|St Mary's College]] and [[St Leonard's College (University of St Andrews)|St Leonard's College]].  The purpose of the colleges at St Andrews is mainly ceremonial, as students are housed in separate residential halls or private accommodations. United College is responsible for all students in the faculties of arts, sciences and medicine, and is based around St Salvator's Quadrangle.<ref name="United College">{{cite web|title=United College|url=http://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/administration/principalsoffice/members/master/|accessdate=15 February 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130209064511/http://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/administration/principalsoffice/members/master/|archivedate=9 February 2013|df=dmy-all}}</ref> St Mary's College is responsible for all students studying in the Faculty of Divinity, and has its own dedicated site in St Mary's Quadrangle.<ref name="St Marys college">{{cite web|title=St Marys college|url=http://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/divinity/|accessdate=15 February 2013}}</ref> St Leonard's College is now responsible for all postgraduate students.<ref name="St Leonards College">{{cite web|title=St Leonards College|url=http://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/pgstudents/stleonards/|accessdate=15 February 2013}}</ref>

===Faculties and schools===
The four academic [[Faculty (division)|faculties]] collectively encompass 18 schools. A [[Dean (education)|dean]] is appointed by the [[Master of the United College]] to oversee the day-to-day running of each faculty. Students apply to become members of a particular faculty, as opposed to the school within which teaching is based. The faculties and their affiliated schools are:

*Faculty of Arts: art history, classics, economics, English, film studies, history, international relations, management, modern languages, philosophy.<ref name="Faculty of Arts">{{cite web|title=Faculty of Arts|url=http://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/study/ug/options/faculties/arts/|accessdate=13 August 2014}}</ref>

==Academics==

===Semesters===
[[File:The Scores, St Andrews - geograph.org.uk - 139944.jpg|thumb|The Scores]]
The academic year at St Andrews is divided into two semesters, [[Martinmas]] and [[Candlemas]], named after two of the four [[Scottish term days|Scottish Term and Quarter Days]]. Martinmas, on 11 November, was originally the feast of [[Saint Martin of Tours]], a 4th-century bishop and hermit. Candlemas originally fell on 2 February, the day of the feast of the [[Presentation of Jesus at the Temple|Purification]], or the Presentation of Christ. Martinmas semester runs from early September until mid-December, with examinations taking place just before the Christmas break. There follows an inter-semester period when Martinmas semester business is concluded and preparations are made for the new Candlemas semester, which starts in January and concludes with examinations at the end of May. Graduation is celebrated at the end of June.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/semesterdates/ |title=Semester dates &|publisher=University of St Andrews  |date=August 2014}}</ref>

The [[Guardbridge]] Biomass Energy Centre will generate power using locally sourced wood-fuelled biomass, hot water will be transported to the university through underground pipes to heat and cool laboratories and student residences.<ref>{{cite web|author=|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-edinburgh-east-fife-25448039 |title=St Andrews University plans a £25m energy centre  |work=BBC News |date=20 December 2013| accessdate= 19 May 2015}}</ref> The £25 million project is expected to save 10,000 tonnes of carbon annually and the university aims to establish the site as a knowledge exchange hub which would provide "missing link" facilities to allow research and discoveries made in university labs to be translated to working prototypes.

In October 2013, the university received permission to build six medium-sized turbines at Kenly Wind Farm, near [[Boarhills]]. The wind farms are expected to be operational by 2017 and will bring an estimated £22 million boost to the local and national economy with 19,000 tonnes of carbon saved annually.<ref>{{cite web|author=|url=http://www.fifetoday.co.uk/news/local-headlines/developer-wanted-for-st-andrews-university-s-windfarm-1-3531596 |title=Developer wanted for St Andrews University's windfarm  |work=Fife Today |date=5 September 2014| accessdate= 19 May 2015}}</ref>

==Traditions==
[[File:University Gates - geograph.org.uk - 392463.jpg|thumb|Entrance to St Mary's College]]

===''Sponsio Academica''===
In order to become a student at the university<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/students/rules/ConductDiscipline/Conduct/|title=Student Conduct|publisher=University of St Andrews|accessdate=15 April 2011}}</ref> a person must take an oath in [[Latin language|Latin]] at the point of [[matriculation]], called the ''[[Sponsio Academica]]'', although this tradition now has been digitised and is agreed to as part of an online matriculation process.

''<blockquote>{{lang|la|Nos ingenui adolescentes, nomina subscribentes, sancte pollicemur nos preceptoribus obsequium debitum exhibituros in omnibus rebus ad disciplinam et bonos mores pertinentibus, Senatus Academici autoritati obtemperaturos, et hujus Academiae Andreanae emolumentum et commodum, quantum in nobis sit, procuraturos, ad quemcunque vitae statum pervenerimus. Item agnoscimus si quis nostrum indecore turbulenterve se gesserit vel si parum diligentem in studiis suis se praebuerit neque admonitus se in melius correxerit eum licere Senatui Academico vel poena congruenti adficere vel etiam ex Universitate expellere.}}</blockquote>''

In English:

<blockquote>We students who set down our names hereunder in all good faith make a solemn promise that we shall show due deference to our teachers in all matters relating to order and good conduct, that we shall be subject to the authority of the Senatus Academicus and shall, whatever be the position we attain hereafter, promote, so far as lies in our power, the profit and the interest in our University of St Andrews. Further, we recognise that, if any of us conducts ourselves in an unbecoming or disorderly manner or shows insufficient diligence in their studies and, though admonished, does not improve, it is within the power of the Senatus Academicus to inflict on such students a fitting penalty or even expel them from the University.</blockquote>

===Gowns===
[[File:St Andrews gowns.jpg|thumbnail|left|St Andrews students in undergraduate gowns]]
{{See also|Undergraduate gowns in Scotland}}
One of the most conspicuous traditions at St Andrews is the wearing of academic dress, particularly the distinctive red undergraduate gown of the United College. Undergraduates in Arts and Science subjects can be seen wearing these garments at the installation of a Rector or Chancellor, at chapel services, on 'Pier Walks', at formal hall dinners, at meetings of the Union Debating Society, giving tours to prospective students and visitors as well as on St Andrews day. Divinity students wear a black undergraduate gown with a purple saltire cross on the left facing. Postgraduates wear the graduate gown or, as members of St Leonard College, may wear a black gown trimmed with burgundy, introduced for graduate students whose original university is without academic dress. (See [[Academic dress of the University of St Andrews]].) St Mary's College Post Graduates, however, wear their graduate gown with a purple saltire cross on the left facing.

===Bejant===
Bejant is a term used to refer to first year male students; females being described as Bejantines. Second-year students are known as a Semis, a student in their third year may be referred to as a Tertian, and in their final year as a Magistrand. These terms are thought<ref>See A.S.Neill 'A Dominie's Log', page 193 (ch. XVII): "... the St. Andrew's students form a small happy family; if a reference is made to Bejant Smith everyone understands it. If you mentioned Bejant Smith in the Edinburgh 'Student' no one would know whom you were referring to."</ref>{{verification failed|date=October 2018}} to be unique to St Andrews. When wearing their traditional red gowns, students in each year may be identified according to the way they wear their gowns. In the first year, the gown is worn on the shoulders, in the second year it is worn slightly off the shoulders. In the third year arts students wear their gowns off their left shoulders, and science students off their right shoulders. Finally, fourth years wear their gowns right down to their elbows, ready to shed their scarlet gowns for the black graduation gown. The gown is never to be joined at the top as this is considered bad luck.

===Academic parents===
The students of the University enjoy an unusual ''family tradition'' designed to make new students feel at home and build relationships within the student body. Traditionally, a Bejant or Bejantine acquires academic parents who are at least in their third year as students. These older students act as informal mentors in academic and social matters and it is not uncommon for such academic family ties to stretch well beyond student days. Tradition has it that a Bejant may ask a man to be his ''Senior Man'' but must be invited by a woman who is prepared to be his ''Senior Woman''. Similarly, a Bejantine may ask a male to be her Senior Man but there is no overt ''rule'' regarding how she acquires a Senior Woman. The establishment of these relationships begins at the very start of the first semester – with the aim of being in place ahead of Raisin Weekend.<ref name="St Andrews Fresher">{{cite web|title=St Andrews Fresher A guide to academic families|url=http://www.standrewsfreshers.com/index.php?content=traditions&subcontent=academic_families|accessdate=31 December 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120718063819/http://www.standrewsfreshers.com/index.php?content=traditions|archivedate=18 July 2012|df=dmy-all}}</ref>

===Raisin Weekend===
[[File:St Andrews Quad.jpg|thumb|St Salvator's Quadrangle during the Raisin Weekend foam fight]]
Raisin Weekend celebrates the relationship between the Bejants/Bejantines (First-Year students) and their respective Academic Parents who, in St. Andrews' tradition, guide and mentor them in their time at the University. It is traditionally said that students went up to study with a sack of oatmeal and a barrel of salt-herring as staple foods to last them a term and that therefore anything more exotic was seen as a luxury. In return for the guidance from academic parents a further tradition sprang up of rewarding these "parents" with a pound of raisins. Since the 19th century the giving of raisins was steadily transformed into the giving of a more modern alternative – such as a bottle of wine. In return for the raisins or equivalent present the parents give their "children" a formal receipt – the ''Raisin Receipt'' – composed in Latin. Over time this receipt progressively became more elaborate and often humorous. The receipt can be written on anything and is to be carried everywhere by the Bejant/Bejantine on the morning of Raisin Monday until midday.<ref>{{cite web|author=BAM Agency Ltd |url=http://www.yourunion.net/raisin |title=St Andrews Students' Association – The Home for St Andrews University Students |publisher=Yourunion.net |date= |accessdate=3 January 2013}}</ref>

Raisin Weekend is held annually over the last weekend of November. Affairs often begin with a tea party (or similar) thrown by the mother(s) and then a pub-crawl or house party led by the father(s). It is fairly common for several academic families to combine in the latter stages of the revels.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.standrewsfreshers.com/index.php?content=traditions&subcontent=raisin_weekend |title=Raisin Weekend |publisher=St. Andrews Freshers |date= |accessdate=3 January 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120718063819/http://www.standrewsfreshers.com/index.php?content=traditions |archivedate=18 July 2012 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> At midday all the First-Years gather in Quad of St Salvator's College to compare their receipts and also to be open to challenge from older students who may look for errors in the Latin of the receipt (an almost inevitable occurrence). Upon detection of such error(s) the bearer may be required to sing the [[Gaudeamus igitur|Gaudie]]. In recent years the gathering has culminated in a shaving foam fight.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.spiegel.de/international/europe/raisin-weekend-foam-fondling-and-malfeasance-at-st-andrews-a-583468.html |title=Raisin Weekend: Foam, Fondling and Malfeasance at St. Andrews|publisher=Spiegel.de |date= |accessdate=3 January 2013}}</ref>
Raisin Weekend has also become synonymous with binge drinking and a certain amount of humiliation of "academic children", commonly involving embarrassing costumes or drinking games. The University Students' Association provides a special First Aid hotline for Raisin Weekend.<ref name="Raisin weekend youtube video 2012">{{cite web|author=|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JPMTuNYxe20 |title=Raisin Weekend 2012 – University of St Andrews |publisher=YouTube |date=31 March 2012 |accessdate=4 November 2012}}</ref>

===Cobblestones===
Situated around the town of St Andrews are cobblestone markings denoting where [[Protestant]] [[martyr]]s were burnt at the stake. To students, the most notable of these is the cobblestone initials "PH" located outside the main gate of St Salvator's College. These cobblestones denote where [[Patrick Hamilton (martyr)|Patrick Hamilton]] was martyred in 1528.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://reformationhistory.org/patrickhamilton.html|title=Reformation History|website=reformationhistory.org}}</ref> According to student tradition, stepping on the "PH" will cause a student to become cursed, with the effect that the offender will fail his or her degree and so students are known to jump over the cobblestones when passing. The 'curse' is said to be lifted by running backwards around St. Salvator's College 8 times while naked, or by participating in the May Dip.<ref>[http://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/about/UniversityChapels/ChapelofStSalvator/] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070609103751/http://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/about/UniversityChapels/ChapelofStSalvator/|date=9 June 2007}}</ref> [[File:St Andrews May Dip 2013.jpg|thumb|right|St Andrews May Dip 2013]]

===May Dip===
The May Dip is a student tradition held annually at dawn on [[May Day]]. Students usually stay awake until dawn, at which time they collectively run into the North Sea to the sound of [[madrigal (music)|madrigals]] sung by the University Madrigal Group.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/potw/2011/Name,67906,en.html |title=2011 &#124; University of St Andrews |publisher=University of St Andrews |date=5 May 2011 |accessdate=5 June 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120620100224/http://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/potw/2011/Name,67906,en.html |archive-date=20 June 2012 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}</ref> Students purportedly do so to cleanse themselves of any academic sins (which they may have acquired by stepping on the PH cobblestone) before they sit exams in May.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.visitstandrews.com/themaydip/|title=The May Dip|publisher=Visit St Andrews}}</ref> In 2011, the event was 'officially' moved by the Students' Association to East Sands in response to concerns for health and safety in its former location on Castle Sands.
