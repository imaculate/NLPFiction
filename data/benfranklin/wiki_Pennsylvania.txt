'''Pennsylvania''',<ref>Pronounced {{IPAc-en|audio=en-us-Pennsylvania.ogg|ˌ|p|ɛ|n|s|ɪ|l|ˈ|v|eɪ|n|j|ə|}}, {{respell|PEN|sil|VAYN|yuh}}</ref> officially the '''Commonwealth of Pennsylvania''', is a [[U.S. state|state]] located in the [[Northeastern United States|northeastern]] and [[Mid-Atlantic States|Mid-Atlantic]] regions of the [[United States]]. The [[Appalachian Mountains]] run through its middle. The [[Commonwealth (U.S. state)|Commonwealth]] is bordered by [[Delaware]] to the southeast, [[Maryland]] to the south, [[West Virginia]] to the southwest, [[Ohio]] to the west, [[Lake Erie]] and the [[List of Canadian provinces and territories|Canadian]] province of [[Ontario]] to the northwest, [[New York (state)|New York]] to the north, and [[New Jersey]] to the east.

Pennsylvania is the [[List of U.S. states and territories by area|33rd-largest]] state by area, and the [[List of U.S. states and territories by population|6th-most populous]] state according to the most recent official [[2010 United States Census|U.S. Census count in 2010]]. It is the [[List of U.S. states and territories by population density|9th-most densely populated]] of the 50 states. Pennsylvania's two most populous cities are [[Philadelphia]] (1,580,863), and [[Pittsburgh]] (302,407). The state capital and its 10th largest city is [[Harrisburg, Pennsylvania|Harrisburg]]. Pennsylvania has {{convert|140|mi|km|0}} of waterfront along [[Erie Triangle|Lake Erie]] and the [[Delaware River|Delaware]] Estuary.<ref name="Coastalmanagement.noaa.gov">{{cite web|url=https://coast.noaa.gov/data/docs/states/shorelines.pdf |title=General Coastline and Shoreline Mileage of the United States |publisher=NOAA Office of Coastal Management |accessdate=December 31, 2016}}</ref>

The state is one of the [[Thirteen Colonies|13 original founding states]] of the United States; it came into being in 1681 as a result of a royal [[land grant]] to [[William Penn]], the son of the state's namesake. Part of Pennsylvania (along the Delaware River), together with the present State of Delaware, had earlier been organized as the Colony of New Sweden. It was the second state to ratify the [[United States Constitution]], on December 12, 1787. [[Independence Hall]], where the [[United States Declaration of Independence]] and United States Constitution were drafted, is located in the state's [[List of cities in Pennsylvania|largest city]] of Philadelphia. During the [[American Civil War]], the [[Battle of Gettysburg]] was fought in the [[South Central Pennsylvania|south central]] region of the state. [[Valley Forge National Historical Park|Valley Forge]] near Philadelphia was [[George Washington|General Washington]]'s headquarters during the bitter winter of 1777–78.

Of the original [[Thirteen Colonies]], Pennsylvania is the only state that does not border the [[Atlantic Ocean]].

The boundaries of the state are the [[Mason–Dixon line]] (39° 43' N) to the south, the [[Twelve-Mile Circle]] on the Pennsylvania-Delaware border, the [[Delaware River]] to the east, 80° 31' W to the west and the [[42nd parallel north|42° N]] to the north, with the exception of a short segment on the western end, where a triangle extends north to [[Lake Erie]].

Cities include [[Philadelphia]], [[Reading, Pennsylvania|Reading]], [[Lebanon, Pennsylvania|Lebanon]] and [[Lancaster, Pennsylvania|Lancaster]] in the southeast, [[Pittsburgh]] in the southwest, the tri-cities of [[Allentown, Pennsylvania|Allentown]], [[Bethlehem, Pennsylvania|Bethlehem]], and [[Easton, Pennsylvania|Easton]] in the central east (known as the [[Lehigh Valley]]). The [[Northeastern Pennsylvania|northeast]] includes the former anthracite coal mining cities of [[Scranton, Pennsylvania|Scranton]], [[Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania|Wilkes-Barre]], [[Pittston, Pennsylvania|Pittston]] ([[Greater Pittston]]), and [[Hazleton, Pennsylvania|Hazleton]]. [[Erie, Pennsylvania|Erie]] is located in the northwest. [[State College, Pennsylvania|State College]] serves the central region while [[Williamsport, Pennsylvania|Williamsport]] serves the commonwealth's north-central region, with [[York, Pennsylvania|York]], [[Carlisle, Pennsylvania|Carlisle]], and the state capital Harrisburg on the [[Susquehanna River]] in the east-central region of the Commonwealth and [[Altoona, Pennsylvania|Altoona]] and [[Johnstown, Pennsylvania|Johnstown]] in the west-central region.

The state has five geographical regions, namely the [[Allegheny Plateau]], [[Ridge-and-Valley Appalachians|Ridge and Valley]], [[Atlantic Coastal Plain]], [[Piedmont (United States)|Piedmont]], and the [[Erie Plain]].

==Climate==
[[File:Pennsylvania Köppen.svg|thumb|Köppen climate types of Pennsylvania]]
[[File:Flickr - Nicholas T - Endless Mountains Landscape (1).jpg|thumb|Autumn in North Branch Township, [[Wyoming County, Pennsylvania]]]]
{{Main|Climate of Pennsylvania}}
Pennsylvania's diverse topography also produces a variety of climates, though the entire state experiences cold winters and humid summers. Straddling two major zones, the majority of the state, with the exception of the southeastern corner, has a [[humid continental climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification]] ''Dfa''). The largest city, [[Philadelphia]], has some characteristics of the [[humid subtropical climate]] (Köppen ''Cfa'') that covers much of [[Delaware]] and [[Maryland]] to the south.

Moving toward the mountainous interior of the state, the winter climate becomes colder, the number of cloudy days increases, and snowfall amounts are greater. Western areas of the state, particularly locations near [[Lake Erie]], can receive over {{convert|100|in|cm}} of snowfall annually, and the entire state receives plentiful precipitation throughout the year. The state may be subject to severe weather from spring through summer into fall. Tornadoes occur annually in the state, sometimes in large numbers, such as 30 recorded tornadoes in 2011; generally speaking, these tornadoes do not cause significant damage.<ref>[http://www.homefacts.com/tornadoes/Pennsylvania.html/] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150517123642/http://www.homefacts.com/tornadoes/Pennsylvania.html/ |date=May 17, 2015 }}</ref>

On March 12, 1664, [[Charles II of England|King Charles II of England]] gave [[James II of England|James, Duke of York]] a grant that incorporated all lands included in the original Virginia Company of Plymouth Grant plus other lands.

Between 1730 and when it was shut down by Parliament with the Currency Act of 1764, the Pennsylvania Colony made its own paper money to account for the shortage of actual gold and silver. The paper money was called [[Colonial Scrip]]. The Colony issued "bills of credit", which were as good as gold or silver coins because of their legal tender status. Since they were issued by the government and not a banking institution, it was an interest-free proposition, largely defraying the expense of the government and therefore taxation of the people. It also promoted general employment and prosperity, since the Government used discretion and did not issue too much to inflate the currency. [[Benjamin Franklin]] had a hand in creating this currency, of which he said its utility was never to be disputed, and it also met with the "cautious approval" of [[Adam Smith]].<ref>Hamilton, Alexander and Syrett, Harold C. ''The Papers of Alexander Hamilton''. 1963, page 240.</ref>

The General Assembly met at Grace Methodist Church on State Street (still standing) until a new capitol could be built. Following an architectural selection contest that many alleged had been "rigged", [[Chicago]] architect [[Henry Ives Cobb]] was charged with designing and building a replacement building; however, the legislature had little money to allocate to the project, and a roughly finished, somewhat industrial building (the Cobb Capitol) was completed. The General Assembly refused to occupy the building. Political and popular indignation in 1901 prompted a second contest that was restricted to Pennsylvania architects, and [[Joseph Miller Huston]] of Philadelphia was chosen to design the present [[Pennsylvania State Capitol]] that incorporated Cobb's building into magnificent public work finished and dedicated in 1907.<ref name=legiscap/>

At the beginning of the 20th century Pennsylvania's economy centered on steel production, logging, coal mining, textile production and other forms of industrial manufacturing.

As of 2011, 32.1% of Pennsylvania's population younger than age one were minorities.<ref>"[http://www.cleveland.com/datacentral/index.ssf/2012/06/americas_under_age_1_populatio.html Americans under age 1 now mostly minorities, but not in Ohio: Statistical Snapshot]". ''[[The Plain Dealer]]''. June 3, 2012.</ref>

Pennsylvania's Hispanic population grew by 82.6% between 2000 and 2010, making it one of the largest increases in a state's Hispanic population. The significant growth of the Hispanic population is due to immigration to the state mainly from Puerto Rico, which is a US territory, but to a lesser extent from countries such as the Dominican Republic, Mexico, and various Central and South American nations, as well as from the wave of Hispanics leaving New York and New Jersey for safer and more affordable living. The Asian population swelled by almost 60%, which was fueled by Indian, Vietnamese, and Chinese immigration, as well the many Asian transplants moving to Philadelphia from New York. The rapid growth of this community has given Pennsylvania one of the largest Asian populations in the nation by numerical values. The Black and African American population grew by 13%, which was the largest increase in that population amongst the state's peers (New York, New Jersey, Ohio, Illinois, and Michigan). The White population declined by 0.7%, a trend that is beginning to reverse itself. Twelve other states saw decreases in their White populations.<ref>{{cite web|author=2010 Census Data |url=http://2010.census.gov/2010census/data/ |title=2010 Census Data – 2010 Census |publisher=2010.census.gov |accessdate=July 7, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706203009/http://2010.census.gov/2010census/data/ |archivedate=July 6, 2011 }}</ref> The state of Pennsylvania has a high in-migration of blacks and Hispanics from other nearby states, with eastern and south-central portions of the state seeing the bulk of the increases.<ref name="pasdc.hbg.psu.edu">{{cite web|url=https://pasdc.hbg.psu.edu/sdc/pasdc_files/researchbriefs/2010_Census_PL94_Release_RB_FINAL.pdf |format=PDF |title=Research Brief : The Commonwealth's Official Source for Population and Economic Statistics |date=March 9, 2011 |website=Pasdc.hbg.psu.edu |accessdate=June 26, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://centropr.hunter.cuny.edu/research/datacenter/puerto-ricans-leave-ny-report-tells-where-they-go|title=Puerto Ricans Leave N.Y.

As of 2018, Pennsylvania has an estimated population of 12,823,989, which is an increase of 18,452 from the previous year and an increase of 121,610 since the year 2010. Net [[Human migration|migration]] to other states resulted in a decrease of 27,718, and [[Immigration to the United States|immigration]] from other countries resulted in an increase of 127,007. Net migration to the Commonwealth was 98,289. Migration of native Pennsylvanians resulted in a decrease of 100,000 people.

Foreign born Pennsylvanians are largely from Asia (36.0%), Europe (35.9%), and Latin America (30.6%), with the remainder from Africa (5%), North America (3.1%), and Oceania (0.4%).

The majority of Hispanics in Pennsylvania are of [[Puerto Rican American|Puerto Rican]] descent, having one of the largest and fastest-growing Puerto Rican populations in the country.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://factfinder.census.gov/faces/tableservices/jsf/pages/productview.xhtml?pid=ACS_10_1YR_DP05&prodType=table|title=American FactFinder – Results|author=Data Access and Dissemination Systems (DADS)|website=census.gov}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://content.usatoday.com/dist/custom/gci/InsidePage.aspx?cId=thedailyjournal&sParam=53490820.story|title=Thedailyjournal – Puerto Rico's population exodus is all about jobs|website=usatoday.com}}</ref> Most of the remaining Hispanic population is made up of [[Mexican American|Mexicans]] and [[Dominican American|Dominicans]].

As of 2010, it is estimated that about 85% of all Hispanics in Pennsylvania live within a {{convert|150|mi|km|adj=mid}} radius of Philadelphia, with about 20% living within the city itself.

Of the black population, the vast majority in the state are African American, being descendants of [[Slavery in the United States|African slaves brought to the US south]] during the colonial era.

Whites make-up the majority of Pennsylvania, they are mostly descended from German, Irish, Italian, and English immigrants, among others.

The "[[Wyoming Valley]]" or the [[Scranton/Wilkes-Barre Metropolitan Area]] has a large concentration of whites. As a matter of fact, it has the highest percentage of white residents than any other metropolitan area in the U.S. with 96.2% of its population claiming to be white with no Hispanic background.

====Pennsylvania German language====
{{Main|Pennsylvania German language}}

Pennsylvania German is often—even though misleadingly—called "Pennsylvania Dutch". The term "Dutch" used to mean "German"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=dutch&x=57&y=13 |title=Definition of "dutch" |publisher=Dictionary.reference.com |accessdate=July 31, 2010}}</ref> (including the Netherlands), before the Latin name for them replaced it (but stuck with the Netherlands). When referring to the language spoken by the [[Pennsylvania Dutch|Pennsylvania Dutch people]] ([[Pennsylvania German language|Pennsylvania German]]) it means "German" or "Teutonic" rather than "Netherlander". Germans, in their own language, call themselves "Deutsch", (Pennsylvania German: "Deitsch"). The [[Pennsylvania German language]] is a descendant of German, in the [[West Central German]] dialect family. It is closest to [[Palatine German language|Palatine German]]. Pennsylvania German is still very vigorous as a first language among [[Amish|Old Order Amish]] and [[Old Order Mennonite]]s (principally in the [[Lancaster County, Pennsylvania|Lancaster County area]]), whereas it is almost extinct as an everyday language outside the [[Plain people|plain communities]], though a few words have passed into English usage.

===Banking===
The first nationally chartered bank in the United States, the [[Bank of North America]], was founded in 1781 in Philadelphia. After a series of mergers, the Bank of North America is part of [[Wells Fargo]], which uses national charter 1.

Pennsylvania is also the home to the first nationally chartered bank under the 1863 [[National Banking Act]]. That year, the Pittsburgh Savings & Trust Company received a national charter and renamed itself the First National Bank of Pittsburgh as part of the National Banking Act. That bank is still in existence today as [[PNC Financial Services]] and remains based in Pittsburgh. PNC is the state's largest bank, and the sixth-largest in the United States.

Casino gambling was legalized in Pennsylvania in 2004. Currently, there are nine casinos across the state with three under construction or in planning. Only horse racing, slot machines and electronic table games were legal in Pennsylvania, although a bill to legalize [[table games]] was being negotiated in the fall of 2009.<ref>[http://www.kyw1060.com/Pa--Lawmakers-Consider-Table-Games--More-Small-Cas/5763077] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091128081600/http://www.kyw1060.com/Pa--Lawmakers-Consider-Table-Games--More-Small-Cas/5763077 |date=November 28, 2009 }}</ref> Table games such as poker, roulette, blackjack and craps were finally approved by the state legislature in January 2010, being signed into law by the Governor on January 7. 

Former Governor [[Ed Rendell]] had considered legalizing video poker machines in bars and private clubs in 2009, since an estimated 17,000 operate illegally across the state.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.post-gazette.com/pg/09035/946691-85.stm |title=Rendell wants legal video poker |publisher=Post-gazette.com |date=February 4, 2009 |accessdate=July 31, 2010 | first1=Tom | last1=Barnes | first2=Gary | last2=Rotstein}}</ref> Under this plan, any establishment with a liquor license would be allowed up to 5 machines. All machines would be connected to the state's computer system, like commercial casinos. The state would impose a 50% tax on net gambling revenues, after winning players have been paid, with the remaining 50% going to the establishment owners.

[[File:United States presidential election in Pennsylvania, 2016.svg|thumb|left|[[Treemap]] of the popular vote by county, 2016 presidential election.]]

For most of the second half of the 20th century and into the 21st century, Pennsylvania has been a powerful [[swing state]]. It only supported the losing candidate in a presidential election twice from 1932 to 1988. Since 1992, Pennsylvania has been trending Democratic in Presidential elections, voting for Bill Clinton twice by large margins, and slightly closer in 2000 for Al Gore. In the 2004 Presidential Election, Senator [[John F. Kerry]] beat President [[George W. Bush]] in Pennsylvania 2,938,095 (50.92%) to 2,793,847 (48.42%). In the [[United States presidential election, 2008|2008 Presidential Election]], Democrat [[Barack Obama]] defeated Republican [[John McCain]] in Pennsylvania, 3,184,778 (54%) to 2,584,088 (44%). Most recently, in the [[United States presidential election, 2016|2016 Presidential Election]], [[Donald Trump]] became the first Republican candidate to win the state since 1988, winning the state 48.6% to 47.8%.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://lancasteronline.com/news/local/donald-trump-becomes-st-republican-to-win-pennsylvania-since/article_9173e044-a647-11e6-885f-a35dd164ac8c.html|title=Donald Trump becomes 1st Republican to win Pennsylvania since 1988|last=PRESS|first=ASSOCIATED|newspaper=LancasterOnline|access-date=November 13, 2016}}</ref> The state holds 20 [[Electoral college|electoral]] votes.<ref name="PAFacts">{{cite web|url=https://pasdc.hbg.psu.edu/sdc/pasdc_files/pastats/PAFacts_2017.pdf|title=Pennsylvania Facts 2017|last=|first=|date=|year=2017|website=|publisher=Pennsylvania State Data Center Penn State Harrisburg|format=PDF|accessdate=February 11, 2018}}</ref>

In recent national elections, Pennsylvania has leaned [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]]. The state voted for the Democratic ticket for president in every election between 1992 and 2012. During the 2008 election campaign a recruitment drive saw registered Democrats outnumber registered Republicans by 1.2 million. However, Pennsylvania has a history of electing Republican senators. From 2009 to 2011, the state was represented by two Democratic senators for the first time since 1947. In 2010, Republicans recaptured a U.S. Senate seat as well as a majority of the state's congressional seats, control of both chambers of the state legislature and the governor's mansion. Democrats won back the governor's mansion 4 years later in the [[Pennsylvania gubernatorial election, 2014|2014 election]]. It was the first time since a governor became eligible to succeed himself that an incumbent governor had been defeated for reelection.

Historically, Democratic strength was concentrated in Philadelphia in the southeast, the Pittsburgh and [[Johnstown, Pennsylvania|Johnstown]] areas in the southwest, and [[Scranton]]/[[Wilkes-Barre]] in the northeast. Republican strength was concentrated in the Philadelphia suburbs, as well as the more rural areas in the central, northeastern, and western portions. The latter counties have long been among the most conservative areas in the nation. Since 1992, however, the Philadelphia suburbs have swung Democratic; the brand of Republicanism there was traditionally a moderate one. The Pittsburgh suburbs, historically a Democratic stronghold, have swung more Republican since the turn of the millennium.

Democratic political consultant [[James Carville]] once pejoratively described Pennsylvania as "Philadelphia in the east, Pittsburgh in the west and Alabama in the middle". Political analysts and editorials refer to central Pennsylvania as the "T" in statewide elections. Philadelphia, Pittsburgh, and Scranton/Wilkes-Barre generally vote for Democratic candidates, while the majority of the counties in the central part of the state vote Republican. As a result, maps showing the results of statewide elections invariably form a "T" shape.

====Taxation====
Pennsylvania has the 10th-highest tax burden in the United States.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://taxfoundation.org/state-tax-climate/pennsylvania|title=The facts on Pennsylvania's Tax Climate|publisher=Tax Foundation|accessdate=August 22, 2012}}</ref> Residents pay a total of $83.7 billion in state and local taxes with a per capita average of $6,640 annually. Residents share 76% of the total tax burden. Many state politicians have tried to increase the share of taxes paid by out of state sources. Suggested revenue sources include taxing natural gas drilling as Pennsylvania is the only state without such a tax on gas drilling.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://articles.philly.com/2011-07-03/news/29733315_1_shale-tax-extraction-tax-drilling-tax |title=Shale tax comes up dry for 3d year |publisher=Articles.philly.com |date=July 3, 2011 |accessdate=September 19, 2011}}</ref> Additional revenue prospects include trying to place tolls on interstate highways; specifically [[Interstate 80 in Pennsylvania|Interstate 80]] which is used heavily by out of state commuters with high maintenance costs.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tollroadsnews.com/node/4527 |title=Gov Rendell says all of Pennsylvania's transit agencies will get I-80 toll $s |publisher=TOLLROADSnews |date=January 6, 2010 |accessdate=September 19, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120405231239/http://www.tollroadsnews.com/node/4527 |archivedate=April 5, 2012 |df= }}</ref>

[[Sales tax]] provides 39% of Commonwealth's revenue; [[State income tax|personal income tax]] 34%; motor vehicle taxes about 12%, and taxes on [[Cigarette tax#Taxation|cigarettes]] and alcohol beverage 5%.<ref>[http://www.revenue.state.pa.us/revenue/CWP/view.asp?Q=261929&A=208 ''Revenue Department Releases August Collections (09/01/2006)''] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080515021138/http://www.revenue.state.pa.us/revenue/CWP/view.asp?Q=261929&A=208 |date=May 15, 2008 }}</ref> Personal income tax is a flat 3.07%. An individual's taxable income is based on the following eight types of income: compensation (salary); interest; dividends; net profits from the operation of a business, profession or farm; net gains or income from the dispositions of property; net gains or income from rents, royalties, patents and copyrights; income derived through estates or trusts; and gambling and [[lottery]] winnings (other than [[Pennsylvania Lottery]] winnings).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.portal.state.pa.us/portal/server.pt/community/personal_income_tax/11409 |title=Personal Income Tax |publisher=Portal.state.pa.us |accessdate=July 31, 2010}}</ref>

Counties, municipalities, and [[school district]]s levy taxes on real estate. In addition, some local bodies assess a [[income tax|wage tax]] on personal income. Generally, the total wage tax rate is capped at 1% of income but some municipalities with [[home rule]] charters may charge more than 1%. Thirty-two of the Commonwealth's sixty-seven counties levy a [[property tax|personal property tax]] on stocks, bonds, and similar holdings.

With the exception of the city of [[Philadelphia]], Pennsylvania, municipalities and school districts are allowed to enact a local earned income tax within the purview of Act 32. Residents of these municipalities and school districts are required to file a local income tax return in addition to federal and state returns. This local return is filed with the local income tax collector, a private collection agency (e.g. [[Berkheimer]], [[Keystone Collections]], and [[Jordan Tax Service]]) appointed by a particular county to collect the local earned income and local services tax (the latter a flat fee deducted from salaried employees working within a particular municipality or school district).<ref>{{cite web|title=Local Income Tax Information|url=http://dced.pa.gov/local-government/local-income-tax-information/#.WD8AMuYrJEY|website=PA Department of Community & Economic Development|accessdate=November 30, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Berkheimer|url=http://www.hab-inc.com/|website=Berkheimer|accessdate=November 30, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Keystone Collections Group|url=https://www.keystonecollects.com/|website=Keystone Collections Group|accessdate=November 30, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Jordan Tax Service|url=https://www.jordantax.com/|website=Jordan Tax Service|accessdate=November 30, 2016}}</ref>

The City of [[Philadelphia]] has its own local income taxation system. Philadelphia-based employers are required to withhold the Philadelphia wage tax from the salaries of their employees. Residents of Philadelphia working for an employer are not required to file a local return as long as their Philadelphia wage tax is fully withheld by their employer. If their employer does not withhold the Philadelphia wage tax, residents are required to register with the Revenue Department and file an Earnings Tax return. Residents of Philadelphia with self-employment income are required to file a Net Profits tax (NPT) return, while those with business income from Philadelphia sources are required to obtain a Commercial Activity License (CAL) and pay the Business Income and Receipts tax (BIRT) and the NPT. Residents with unearned income (except for interest from checking and savings accounts) are required to file and pay the School Income tax (SIT).<ref>{{cite web|title=Department of Revenue|url=https://beta.phila.gov/departments/department-of-revenue/|website=City of Philadelphia|accessdate=November 30, 2016}}</ref>

The complexity of Pennsylvania local tax filing system has been criticized by experts, who note that the outsourcing collections to private entities is akin to [[tax farming]] and that many new residents are caught off guard and end up facing "failure to file" penalties even if they did not have any tax due. Attempts to transfer local income tax collections to the state level (i.e. by having a separate local section on the state income tax return, currently the method used to collect local income taxes in [[New York (state)|New York]], [[Maryland]], [[Indiana]], and [[Iowa]]) have been unsuccessful.<ref>{{cite web|title=Taking a Closer Look at Government: Pennsylvania's Local Taxation "System"|url=http://issuespa.org/content/taking-closer-look-government-pennsylvanias-local-taxation-system|website=issuespa.org|accessdate=November 30, 2016}}</ref>

====Federal Representation====
{{Main|Pennsylvania's congressional districts}}
Pennsylvania's two [[United States Senate|U.S. Senators]] are [[Bob Casey, Jr.]] and [[Pat Toomey]].

Pennsylvania currently has 18 seats in the [[United States House of Representatives]], as of the [[2010 United States Census|2010 Census]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.govtrack.us/congress/members/PA |title=Pennsylvania's Members of Congress & Congressional District Map |accessdate=February 11, 2013}}</ref>

==Health==
Pennsylvania has a mixed health record, and is ranked as the 29th-overall-healthiest state according to the 2013 United Health Foundation's Health Rankings.<ref name=ahr>{{cite web|title=Pennsylvania|website=America's Health Rankings 2013|publisher=United Health Foundation|date=|url=http://www.americashealthrankings.org/PA |accessdate=August 28, 2014}}</ref>

==Education==
{{Main|Education in Pennsylvania}}
[[File:Penn campus 2.jpg|thumb|The [[University of Pennsylvania]] quadrangle in [[Philadelphia]]]]

Pennsylvania has 500 public school districts, thousands of private schools, publicly funded colleges and universities, and over 100 private institutions of higher education.

===Primary and secondary education===
In general, under state law, school attendance in Pennsylvania is mandatory for a child from the age of 8 until the age of 17, or until graduation from an accredited high school, whichever is earlier.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pde.state.pa.us/|title=Pennsylvania Department of Education (PDE)|accessdate=December 4, 2009}}</ref> As of 2005, 83.8% of Pennsylvania residents age 18 to 24 have completed high school. Among residents age 25 and over, 86.7% have graduated from high school.

The following are the four-year graduation rates for students completing high school in 2016:<ref>{{cite web|publisher=Pennsylvania Department of Education|title=Cohort Graduation Rate|url= http://www.education.pa.gov/Data-and-Statistics/Pages/Cohort-Graduation-Rate-.aspx#tab-1 |accessdate=October 6, 2016}}</ref>

Additionally, 27.5% have gone on to obtain a bachelor's degree or higher.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://nces.ed.gov/|title=National Center for Education Statistics (NCES)|accessdate=December 4, 2009}}</ref> State students consistently do well in standardized testing. In 2007, Pennsylvania ranked 14th in mathematics, 12th in reading, and 10th in writing for 8th grade students.<ref>'NCES.'</ref>

In 1988, the Pennsylvania General Assembly passed Act 169, which allows parents or guardians to homeschool their children as an option for compulsory school attendance. This law specifies the requirements and responsibilities of the parents and the school district where the family lives.<ref>[http://www.pde.state.pa.us/home_education/site/default.asp] 'Pennsylvania Department of Education: Home Education and Private Tutoring.

===Higher education===
{{See also|List of colleges and universities in Pennsylvania}}

The [[Pennsylvania State System of Higher Education]] (PASSHE) is the [[public university]] system of the Commonwealth, with 14 state-owned schools. The [[Commonwealth System of Higher Education]] is an organizing body of the 4 state-related schools in Pennsylvania, these schools are independent institutions that receive some state funding. There are also 15 publicly funded two-year [[Community colleges in the United States|community colleges]] and technical schools that are separate from the PASSHE system. Additionally there are many private two- and four-year [[technical school]]s, colleges and universities.

[[Carnegie Mellon University]], [[The Pennsylvania State University]], the [[University of Pennsylvania]], and the [[University of Pittsburgh]], are members of the [[Association of American Universities]], an invitation only organization of leading research universities. [[Lehigh University]] is also another renowned private research university located in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania. The Pennsylvania State University is the Commonwealth's [[Land-grant university]], [[National Sea Grant College Program|Sea Grant College]] and, [[National Space Grant College and Fellowship Program|Space Grant College]].
