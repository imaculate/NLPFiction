The '''Edict of Fontainebleau''' (22 October 1685) was an [[edict]] issued by [[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]] of [[France]], also known as the '''Revocation of the Edict of Nantes'''. The [[Edict of Nantes]] (1598) had granted the [[Huguenot]]s the right to practice their religion without persecution from the state. Though Protestants had lost their independence in places of refuge under [[Cardinal Richelieu|Richelieu]] on account of [[Huguenot rebellions|their supposed insubordination]], they continued to live in comparative security and political contentment. From the outset, [[religious toleration]] in France had been a royal, rather than a popular policy.<ref>"The fate of Catholics at the hands of a triumphant Parliament in England suggests that the Protestants in France would have been no better off under more popular institutions," observed R.R. Palmer, ''A History of the Modern World'', rev. ed. 1956:164.</ref> The lack of universal adherence to his religion did not sit well with Louis XIV's vision of perfected [[autocracy]]: "Bending all else to his will, Louis XIV resented the presence of [[heresy|heretics]] among his subjects."{{Attribution needed|date=February 2018}}<ref name="Palmer">Palmer, ''eo. loc.''</ref>

==Edict of Nantes==

The [[Edict of Nantes]] had been issued on 13 April 1598 by [[Henry IV of France]]. It had granted the [[Calvinism|Calvinist]] [[Protestants]] of [[France]] (also known as [[Huguenots]]) substantial [[rights]] in the predominantly [[Catholicism|Catholic]] state. Through the [[Edict]], Henry had aimed to promote civil unity.<ref>In 1898 the tricentennial celebrated the Edict as the foundation of the coming Age of Toleration; the 1998 anniversary, by contrast, was commemorated with a book of essays under the evocatively ambivalent title, ''Coexister dans l'intolérance'' (Michel Grandjean and Bernard Roussel, editors, Geneva, 1998).</ref> The Edict treated some Protestants with tolerance and opened a path for [[secularism]]. It offered general [[freedom of thought|freedom of conscience]] to individuals and many specific concessions to the Protestants, such as amnesty and the reinstatement of their [[civil rights]], including the right to work in any field (including for the state), and to bring grievances directly to the king. It marked the end of the [[French Wars of Religion]] which had afflicted France during the second half of the 16th century.

== Revocation of the Edict of Nantes ==
[[File:Fontainebleau - panoramio.jpg|thumb|The palace at Fontainebleau as it now stands]]
By the Edict of Fontainebleau, Louis XIV revoked the [[Edict of Nantes]] and ordered the destruction of [[Huguenot]] [[Religion in France|churches]], as well as the closing of [[Protestant]] [[Education in France|school]]s. This policy made official the persecution already enforced since the ''[[dragonnade]]s'' created in 1681 by the king in order to intimidate Huguenots into [[religious conversion|converting]] to Catholicism. As a result of the officially sanctioned persecution by the ''[[dragoon]]s'' who were [[billet]]ed upon prominent Huguenots, a large number of Protestants — estimates range from 210,000 to 900,000 — left France over the next two decades. They sought [[refugee|asylum]] in [[England]], the [[Dutch Republic|United Provinces]], [[Sweden]], [[Switzerland]], [[Brandenburg-Prussia]], [[Denmark]], Protestant states of the [[Holy Roman Empire]], the [[Cape Colony]] in Africa, and [[European colonization of the Americas|North America]]<ref>[[Jackson J. Spielvogel|Spielvogel]], 0''Western Civilization — Volume II: Since 1500'' (5th Edition, 2003) p.410</ref> On 17 January 1686, Louis XIV himself claimed that out of a Huguenot population of 800,000 to 900,000, only 1,000 to 1,500 had remained in France.

A strong advocate for persecution of the Protestants was Louis XIV's pious second wife [[Françoise d'Aubigné, Marquise de Maintenon|Madame de Maintenon]], who urged Louis to revoke Henry IV's edict.

The revocation of the Edict of Nantes brought France into line with virtually every other European country of the period (with the brief exception of England, Scotland and the [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]]), where only the majority state religion was legally tolerated. The experiment of religious tolerance in Europe was effectively ended for the time being.

== Effects of the Revocation of the Edict of Nantes ==

The Edict of Fontainebleau is compared by many historians with the 1492 [[Alhambra Decree]], ordering the [[Expulsion of the Jews from Spain]]; and with the [[Expulsion of the Moriscos]] during 1609-1614. The three are similar both as outbursts of religious intolerance ending periods of relative tolerance, and in their social and economic effects. In practice, the revocation caused France to suffer a kind of early [[brain drain]], as it lost a large number of [[skill]]ed [[crafts]]men, including key designers such as [[Daniel Marot]]. Upon leaving France, Huguenots took with them knowledge of important techniques and styles — which had a significant effect on the quality of the [[history of silk|silk]], [[plate glass]], [[silversmithing]], [[watchmaking]], and [[cabinet making]] [[industry|industries]] of those regions to which they relocated. Some rulers, such as [[Friedrich Wilhelm I of Brandenburg|Frederick Wilhelm]], [[Duke]] of [[Prussia]] and [[Prince-elector|Elector]] of [[Brandenburg]], who issued the [[Edict of Potsdam]] in late October 1685, encouraged the Protestants to seek refuge in their nations.

==End of the Edict of Fontainebleau==

In practice, the stringency of policies outlawing Protestants, opposed by the [[Jansenist]]s,<ref>Charles H. O'Brien, "The Jansenist Campaign for Toleration of Protestants in Late Eighteenth-Century France: Sacred or Secular?" ''Journal of the History of Ideas'', 1985:523ff.</ref> was relaxed during the reign of [[Louis XV of France|Louis XV]], especially among discreet members of the upper classes. "The fact that a hundred years later, when Protestants were again tolerated, many of them were found to be both commercially prosperous and politically loyal indicates that they fared far better than the [[Penal Laws|Catholic Irish]]", [[R.R. Palmer]] concluded.<ref name="Palmer"/>

By the end of the 18th century, prominent French philosophers and literary personalities of the day, including [[Anne-Robert-Jacques Turgot]], were making persuasive arguments to promote religious tolerance. Efforts by [[Guillaume-Chrétien de Lamoignon de Malesherbes|Guillaume-Chrétien de Malesherbes]], minister to [[Louis XVI of France|Louis XVI]], and [[Jean-Paul Rabaut Saint-Etienne]], spokesman for the Protestant community in with members of a provincial appellate court or [[parlement]] of the [[Ancien Régime]], were particularly effective in convincing the king to open French society over the concern expressed by some advisors. Thus, on 7 November 1787, Louis XVI signed the [[Edict of Versailles]], known as the edict of tolerance registered in ''parlement'' two-and-a-half months later, on 29 January 1788. This edict offered relief to the main alternative faiths of [[Calvinist]] [[Huguenots]], [[Lutherans]] and [[Judaism in France|Judaism]] – giving followers the civil and legal recognition, as well as the right to openly form congregations after 102 years of prohibition. Full religious freedom had to wait two more years, with enactment of the [[Declaration of the Rights of Man and Citizen of 1789]].  The 1787 edict was a pivotal step in eliminating religious strife, and it officially ended religious persecution in France.<ref>[http://booking-help.org/book_338_glava_314_Edict_of_Versailles_%281787%29.html Encyclopedia of the Age of Political Ideals, ''Edict of Versailles (1787)''], downloaded 29 January 2012</ref> Moreover, once French Revolutionary armies got to other European countries between 1789 and 1815, they followed a consistent policy of [[emancipation|emancipating]] persecuted or discriminated religious communities (Catholic in some countries, Protestant in others, Jews in virtually all).

==The apology==
In October 1985, [[President of France|French President]] [[François Mitterrand]] issued a public apology to the descendants of Huguenots around the world.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://discours.vie-publique.fr/notices/857015500.html |title=Allocution de M.
