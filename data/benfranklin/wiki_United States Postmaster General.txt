The '''Postmaster General of the United States''' is the chief executive officer of the [[United States Postal Service]]; Megan Brennan is the current Postmaster General.

Appointed members of the [[Board of Governors of the United States Postal Service]] select the Postmaster General and Deputy Postmaster General, who then join the Board.

== History ==
The office, in one form or another, is older than both the [[United States Constitution]] and the [[United States Declaration of Independence]].  [[Benjamin Franklin]] was appointed by the [[Continental Congress]] as the first Postmaster General in 1775, serving just over 15 months.

Until 1971, the postmaster general was the head of the [[United States Post Office Department|Post Office Department]] (or simply "Post Office" until the 1820s).<ref>[http://about.usps.com/publications/pub100/welcome.htm Publication 100 – The United States Postal Service: An American History 1775–2006]. [[United States Postal Service]], May 2007. Also available in [http://about.usps.com/publications/pub100.pdf PDF] format.</ref> During that era, the postmaster general was appointed by the [[President of the United States]], with the [[Advice and Consent Clause|advice and consent]] of the [[United States Senate]].<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|url=http://about.usps.com/publications/pub100/pub100_074.htm|title=Postmasters General|last=United States Postal Service|first=|date=|website=about.usps.com|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-05-18}}</ref> From 1829 to 1971, the postmaster general was a member of the [[President of the United States|President's]] [[United States Cabinet|Cabinet]].

The Cabinet post of Postmaster General was often given{{when|date=July 2017}} to a new President's campaign manager or other key political supporter, and was considered something of a [[sinecure]]. The Postmaster General was in charge of the governing party's [[patronage]], and was a powerful position which held much influence within the party.

In 1971, the Post Office Department was re-organized into the [[United States Postal Service]], an independent agency of the executive branch. Therefore, the Postmaster General is no longer a member of the Cabinet and is no longer in the line of [[United States presidential line of succession|presidential succession]]. The postmaster general is now appointed by nine "governors," appointed by the President with the advice and consent of the Senate. The governors, along with the postmaster general and the deputy postmaster general, constitute the full Postal Service Board of Governors.<ref name=":0" /><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://about.usps.com/who-we-are/leadership/board-governors.htm|title=About the Board of Governors|last=United States Postal Service|first=|date=|website=about.usps.com|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-05-18}}</ref>

The Postmaster General is the second-highest paid U.S. government official, based on publicly available salary information, after the President of the United States.<ref>{{cite web|title=The 10 Highest-Paid Government Jobs|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160305081942/https://finance.yahoo.com/news/pf_article_112283.html |archive-date=March 5, 2016 |dead-url=yes |publisher=24/7WallSt.com|accessdate=5 September 2011|author=Michael B.
