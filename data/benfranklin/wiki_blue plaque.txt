A '''blue plaque''' is a permanent sign installed in a public place in the United Kingdom and elsewhere to commemorate a link between that location and a famous person, event, or former building on the site, serving as a [[historical marker]]. The term is used in the United Kingdom in two different senses. It may be used narrowly and specifically to refer to the "official" scheme administered by [[English Heritage]], and currently restricted to sites within [[Greater London]]; or it may be used less formally to encompass a number of similar schemes administered by organisations throughout the UK.

The "official" scheme traces its origins to that launched in 1866 in London, on the initiative of the politician [[William Ewart (British politician)|William Ewart]], to mark the homes and workplaces of famous people.<ref name="spencer">{{cite web |last=Spencer |first=Howard |url=http://www.history.ac.uk/makinghistory/resources/articles/blue_plaques.html#1 |publisher=Institute of Historical Research |title=The commemoration of historians under the blue plaque scheme in London |year=2008 |accessdate=16 June 2011}}</ref><ref name="EHhistory">{{cite web |url=http://www.english-heritage.org.uk/visit/blue-plaques/about-blue-plaques/history-of-blue-plaques/ |publisher=English Heritage |title=The History of Blue Plaques |accessdate=16 December 2017}}</ref> It has been administered successively by the [[Royal Society of Arts|Society of Arts]] (1866–1901), the [[London County Council]] (1901–1965), the [[Greater London Council]] (1965–1986) and [[English Heritage]] (1986 to date). It remains focused on London (now defined as [[Greater London]]), although between 1998 and 2005, under a trial programme since discontinued, 34 plaques were erected elsewhere in England. The first such scheme in the world, it has directly or indirectly provided the inspiration and model for many others.

Many other plaque schemes have since been initiated in the United Kingdom. Some are restricted to a specific geographical area, others to a particular theme of historical commemoration. They are administered by a range of bodies including [[Local government|local authorities]], [[Civic society|civic societies]], [[residents' association]]s and other organisations such as the [[Transport Trust]], the [[Royal Society of Chemistry]], the [[Music Hall Guild of Great Britain and America]] and the British Comic Society. The plaques erected are made in a variety of designs, shapes, materials and colours: some are blue, others are not. However, the term "blue plaque" is often used informally to encompass all such schemes.

There are also commemorative plaque schemes throughout the world such as those in [[Paris]], [[Rome]], [[Oslo]], [[Dublin]]; and in other cities in Australia, Canada, the [[Historical markers of the Philippines|Philippines]], Russia and the United States. The forms these take vary, and they are more likely to be known as [[historical marker]]s.

===English Heritage scheme===
{{Further|List of English Heritage blue plaques in London}}
The original blue plaque scheme was established by the [[Royal Society of Arts|Society of Arts]] in 1867, and since 1986 has been run by [[English Heritage]]. It is the oldest such scheme in the world.<ref name="EHhistory"/><ref name="spencer"/> Since 1984 English Heritage have commissioned Frank Ashworth to make the plaques which have then been inscribed by his wife, Sue, at their home in Cornwall.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.english-heritage.org.uk/visit/blue-plaques/about-blue-plaques/ |title=Built to last: the making of a blue plaque |publisher=English Heritage |accessdate=16 December 2016 }}</ref>

English Heritage plans to erect an average of twelve new blue plaques each year in London.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.english-heritage.org.uk/about/news/blue-plaques/ |publisher=English Heritage |title=Blue Plaque FAQS  |accessdate=15 March 2013}}</ref> Many are unveiled by prominent public people: for example, in 2010 a plaque dedicated to [[John Lennon]] was unveiled in Montagu Square by [[Yoko Ono]], at the house where the couple shot the cover of the album ''[[Unfinished Music No.1: Two Virgins|Two Virgins]]''.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-1323118/John-Lennon-Yoko-Onos-London-home-gets-blue-plaque.html |title=Getting back to where she once belonged: Yoko Ono unveils blue plaque at John Lennon's London home |work=Daily Mail |location=London |date=23 October 2010 |accessdate=7 July 2011}}</ref>

====History====
After being conceived by politician [[William Ewart (British politician)|William Ewart]] in 1863, the scheme was initiated in 1866 by Ewart, [[Henry Cole]] and the Society of Arts (now the [[Royal Society of Arts]]),<ref>Hansard vol 172 17 July 1863 quoted in 'The commemoration of historians under the blue plaque scheme in London' by author Howard Spencer</ref> which erected plaques in a variety of shapes and colours.

The first plaque was unveiled in 1867 to commemorate [[Lord Byron]] at his birthplace, 24 Holles Street, [[Cavendish Square]]. This house was demolished in 1889. The earliest blue plaque to survive, also put up in 1867, commemorates [[Napoleon III]] in King Street, [[St James's]].<ref name="EHhistory"/> Byron’s plaque was blue, but the colour was changed by the manufacturer [[Mintons Ltd|Minton, Hollins & Co]] to chocolate brown to save money.<ref name="lbkc">{{cite web |url=http://www.rbkc.gov.uk/vmblueplaques/general/about_blue_plaques.asp |title=About blue plaques |publisher=Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea |accessdate=16 June 2011}}</ref>

In total the Society of Arts put up 35 plaques, fewer than half of which survive today. The Society only erected one plaque within the square-mile of the [[City of London]], that to [[Samuel Johnson]] on his [[Dr Johnson's House|house in Gough Square]], in 1876. In 1879, it was agreed that the [[City of London Corporation]] would be responsible for erecting plaques within the City to recognise its jurisdictional independence. This demarcation has remained ever since.<ref name="EHhistory"/>

In 1901, the Society of Arts scheme was taken over by the [[London County Council]] (LCC),<ref name="spencer"/> which gave much thought to the future design of the plaques. It was eventually decided to keep the basic shape and design of the Society's plaques, but to make them uniformly blue, with a laurel wreath and the LCC's title.<ref name="EHdesign">{{cite web |url=http://www.english-heritage.org.uk/discover/blue-plaques/about/design/ |publisher=English Heritage |title=The Blue Plaque Design |accessdate=16 June 2011}}</ref> Though this design was used consistently from 1903 to 1938, some experimentation occurred in the 1920s, and plaques were made in bronze, stone and lead. Shape and colour also varied.<ref name="EHdesign"/>

In 1921, the most common (blue) plaque design was revised, as it was discovered that glazed ceramic [[Royal Doulton|Doulton ware]] was cheaper than the [[encaustic tile|encaustic]] formerly used. In 1938, a new plaque design was prepared by an unnamed student at the LCC's Central School of Arts and Crafts and was approved by the committee. It omitted the decorative elements of earlier plaque designs, and allowed for lettering to be better spaced and enlarged. A white border was added to the design shortly after, and this has remained the standard ever since.<ref name="lbkc"/> No plaques were erected between 1915 and 1919, or between 1940 and 1947, owing to the two world wars.<ref name="quinn"/> The LCC formalised the selection criteria for the scheme in 1954.<ref name="EHhistory"/>

When the LCC was abolished in 1965, the scheme was taken over by the [[Greater London Council]] (GLC). The principles of the scheme changed little, but now applied to the entire, much larger, administrative county of [[Greater London]]. The GLC was also keen to broaden the range of people commemorated. The GLC erected 252 plaques, the subjects including [[Sylvia Pankhurst]],<ref>{{openplaque|473}}</ref> [[Samuel Coleridge-Taylor]],<ref>{{openplaque|136}}</ref> and [[Mary Seacole]].<ref>{{openplaque|604}}</ref>

In 1986, the GLC was disbanded and the blue plaques scheme passed to [[English Heritage]]. English Heritage erected more than 300 plaques in London.

In January 2013 English Heritage suspended proposals for plaques owing to funding cuts.<ref name="quinn">{{cite news |title=Blue plaques scheme suspended after 34% cut in government funding |url=https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2013/jan/06/blue-plaques-cut-government-funding|accessdate=7 January 2013 |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |date=6 January 2013 |location=London |first=Ben |last=Quinn}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.english-heritage.org.uk/about/news/blue-plaques/ |title=Blue Plaques scheme position statement |date=8 January 2013 |accessdate=15 March 2013}}</ref> The [[National Trust for Places of Historic Interest or Natural Beauty|National Trust]]'s chairman stated that his organisation might step in to save the scheme.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/9786341/National-Trust-could-save-blue-plaques.html | location=London | work=The Daily Telegraph | first=Louise | last=Gray | title=National Trust could save blue plaques | date=7 January 2013}}</ref> In the event the scheme was relaunched by English Heritage in June 2014 with private funding (including support from a new donors' club, the Blue Plaques Club, and from property developer [[David Pearl (businessman)|David Pearl]]).<ref name=web>{{cite web|url=http://www.english-heritage.org.uk/about/news/london-blue-plaques-re-open-for-nominations/|title=London Blue Plaques Re-Open For Nominations – 18 June 2014 |work=English Heritage |accessdate=27 June 2014}}</ref> Two members of the advisory panel, Professor [[David Edgerton (historian)|David Edgerton]] and author and critic Gillian Darley, resigned over this transmutation, concerned that the scheme had been "reduced to a marketing tool for English Heritage".<ref>{{citation |title=London Blue Plaques scheme re-launched |journal=Salon: [[Society of Antiquaries of London]] Online Newsletter |volume=322 |date=23 June 2014 |url=http://us6.campaign-archive2.com/?u=5557bc147d34993782f185bde&id=413251937e#mctoc16 |accessdate=27 June 2014 }}</ref>

In April 2015, English Heritage was divided into two parts, [[Historic England]] (a statutory body), and the new English Heritage Trust (a charity, which took over the English Heritage operating name and logo). Responsibility for the blue plaque scheme passed to the English Heritage Trust.

====Criteria====
To be eligible for an English Heritage blue plaque in London the famous person concerned must:<ref name="how">{{cite web |url=http://www.english-heritage.org.uk/visit/blue-plaques/propose-a-plaque/ |publisher=English Heritage |title=Propose a plaque |accessdate=16 December 2016}}</ref>
* Have been dead for 20 years or have passed the centenary of their birth. Fictional characters are not eligible;
* Be considered eminent by a majority of members of their own profession; have made an outstanding contribution to human welfare or happiness;
* Have lived or worked in that building in London (excluding the City of London and [[Whitehall]]) for a significant period, in time or importance, within their life and work; be recognisable to the well-informed passer-by, or deserve national recognition.

In cases of foreigners and overseas visitors, candidates should be of international reputation or significant standing in their own country.

With regards to the location of a plaque:
* Plaques can only be erected on the actual building inhabited by a figure, not the site where the building once stood, or on buildings that have been radically altered;
* Plaques are not placed onto boundary walls, gate piers, educational or ecclesiastic buildings, or the [[Inns of Court]];
* Buildings marked with plaques should be visible from the public highway;
* A single person may not be commemorated with more than one blue plaque in London.<ref name="how"/>

Other schemes have different criteria, which are often less restrictive: in particular, it is common under other schemes for plaques to be erected to mark the sites of demolished buildings.

====Selection process====
Almost all the proposals for English Heritage blue plaques are made by members of the public who write or email the organisation before submitting a formal proposal.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.english-heritage.org.uk/discover/blue-plaques/how-to-propose-a-blue-plaque/ |title=How to propose a Blue Plaque |accessdate=7 July 2011}}</ref>

English Heritage's in-house historian researches the proposal, and the Blue Plaques Panel advises on which suggestions should be successful. This is composed of 9 people from various disciplines from across the country. The panel is chaired by Professor [[Ronald Hutton]], and includes former [[Poet Laureate]] Professor Sir [[Andrew Motion]] and buildings historian Professor [[Gavin Stamp]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Blue Plaques Panel |url=http://www.english-heritage.org.uk/about/who-we-are/how-we-are-run/committees-and-panels/blueplaquespanel/ |publisher=English Heritage |accessdate=10 February 2015}}</ref> The actor and broadcaster [[Stephen Fry]] was formerly a member of the panel, and wrote the foreword to the book ''Lived in London: Blue Plaques and the Stories Behind Them'' (2009).<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/books/bookreviews/5788181/Lived-in-London-Blue-Plaques-and-the-Stories-Behind-Them-by-Emily-Cole-review.html  |title=Lived in London: Blue Plaques and the Stories Behind Them by Emily Cole: review  |author=Parker, Peter |work=The Daily Telegraph |location=London |date=11 July 2009 |accessdate=7 July 2010}}</ref>

Roughly a third of proposals are approved in principle, and are placed on a shortlist. Because the scheme is so popular, and because a lot of detailed research has to be carried out, it takes about three years for each case to reach the top of the shortlist. Proposals not taken forward can only be re-proposed once 10 years have elapsed.<ref name="how"/>

====Event plaques====
A small minority of GLC and English Heritage plaques have been erected to commemorate events which took place at particular locations rather than the famous people who lived there.

====Outside London====
[[File:Peter Ellis Plaque at 40 Falkner Square.JPG|thumb|upright=0.9|English Heritage plaque<ref>{{openplaque|1412}}</ref> at 40 [[Falkner Square]], [[Liverpool]], commemorating [[Peter Ellis (architect)|Peter Ellis]], architect (erected 2001)]]
In 1998, English Heritage initiated a trial national plaques scheme, and over the following years erected 34 plaques in [[Birmingham]], [[Merseyside]], [[Southampton]] and [[Portsmouth]]. The scheme was discontinued in 2005. Although English Heritage no longer erects plaques outside Greater London, it does provide advice and guidance to individuals and organisations interested or involved in doing so.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.english-heritage.org.uk/visit/blue-plaques/about-blue-plaques/faq/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150517233221/http://www.english-heritage.org.uk/visit/blue-plaques/about-blue-plaques/faq/ |dead-url=yes |archive-date=17 May 2015 |title=About Blue Plaques: Frequently Asked Questions |publisher=English Heritage |accessdate=13 May 2015}}</ref>

===Other schemes===
The popularity of English Heritage's London blue plaques scheme has meant that a number of comparable schemes have been established elsewhere in the United Kingdom. Many of these schemes also use blue plaques, often manufactured in metal or plastic rather than the ceramic used in London, but some feature plaques of different colours and shapes. In July 2012, English Heritage published a register of plaque schemes run by other organisations across England.<ref name="local register">{{cite web |url=http://www.english-heritage.org.uk/discover/blue-plaques/register/ |title=Register of Plaque Schemes |publisher=[[English Heritage]] |accessdate=16 July 2012}}</ref>

The criteria for selection varies greatly. Many schemes treat plaques primarily as memorials and place them on the sites of former buildings, in contrast to the strict English Heritage policy of only installing a plaque on the actual building in which a famous person lived or an event took place.

====London====
[[File:Lloyds Coffee House (3984416269).jpg|thumb|left|Corporation of London plaque on the site of [[Lloyd's Coffee House]] in [[Lombard Street, London|Lombard Street]]]]
[[File:Josef Dallos plaque.jpg|thumb|right|upright|City of Westminster green plaque at 18 [[Cavendish Square]], [[Marylebone]], commemorating [[Josef Dallos]], contact lens pioneer (erected 2010)]]

The [[City of London Corporation|Corporation of London]] continues to run its own plaque scheme for the [[City of London]], where English Heritage does not erect plaques. City of London plaques are blue and ceramic, but are rectangular in shape and carry the [[Coat of arms of the City of London|City of London coat of arms]].<ref name="EHhistory"/><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cityoflondon.gov.uk/things-to-do/visiting-the-city/walks-tours-and-architecture/blue-plaques/Pages/default.aspx |title=Blue plaques |publisher=City of London |accessdate=19 May 2015 }}</ref> Because of the rapidity of change in the built environment within the City, a high proportion of Corporation of London plaques mark the sites of former buildings.

Many of the 32 [[London boroughs]] also now have their own schemes, running alongside the English Heritage scheme. [[Westminster City Council]] runs a green plaque scheme, each plaque being sponsored by a group with a particular interest in its subject.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.westminster.gov.uk/services/leisureandculture/greenplaques/ |title=Green Plaques Scheme |accessdate=7 July 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120716210428/http://www.westminster.gov.uk/services/leisureandculture/greenplaques/ |archivedate=16 July 2012 |df=dmy }}</ref> The [[London Borough of Southwark]] started its own blue plaque scheme in 2003, under which the borough awards plaques through popular vote following public nomination: living people may be commemorated.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.southwark.gov.uk/DiscoverSouthwark/BluePlaquesSection/blueplaques2007/ |title=Blue Plaque Winners 2007 |publisher=Southwark Borough Council |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080913030453/http://www.southwark.gov.uk/DiscoverSouthwark/BluePlaquesSection/blueplaques2007/ |archivedate=13 September 2008 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> The [[London Borough of Islington]] has a very similar green heritage plaque scheme, initiated in 2010.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.islington.gov.uk/islington/history-heritage/heritage_borough/bor_plaques/recent_plaques/Pages/default.aspx |title=Recent Plaques |publisher=London Borough of Islington |accessdate=19 May 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150322125600/http://www.islington.gov.uk/islington/history-heritage/heritage_borough/bor_plaques/recent_plaques/Pages/default.aspx |archivedate=22 March 2015 |df=dmy }}</ref>

Other plaques may be erected by smaller groups, such as [[residents' association]]s. In 2007 [http://www.hgsra.org.uk/ The Hampstead Garden Suburb Residents Association] erected a blue plaque in memory of Prime Minister [[Harold Wilson]] at 12 Southway as part of the centenary celebrations of [[Hampstead Garden Suburb]].

====Northern Ireland====
In [[Northern Ireland]] the [[Ulster History Circle]] is one of a small number of groups administering blue plaques. Established in 1983, it has erected around 140 plaques.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ulsterhistory.co.uk/index.htm  |title=THe Ulster History Circle |accessdate=7 July 2011}}</ref> [[Belfast City Council]] also has a scheme.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.belfastcity.gov.uk/news/news.asp?id=2492&month=February%202011 |title=Poet and broadcaster remembered  |date=8 February 2011 |accessdate=7 July 2011}}</ref>

From 1985, they were made of cast aluminium, colour-coded to reflect the type of commemoration (blue for people; red for events in the city's social history; black for buildings of architectural or historic interest; green for other subjects). After a period of abeyance, the scheme has been revived and all plaques are now patinated bronze.<ref name="manchester plaques"/>

A long-running [[List of Gateshead blue plaques|blue plaque]] scheme is in operation in [[Metropolitan Borough of Gateshead|Gateshead]]. Run by the council, the scheme was registered with English Heritage in 1970<ref name="local register"/> and 29 blue plaques were installed between the inception of the scheme in 1977 and the publication of a commemorative document in 2010.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gateshead.gov.uk/Leisure%20and%20Culture/Local%20History/Commemorativeplaques.aspx |title=Commemorative Plaques |publisher=Gateshead Council |year=2012 |accessdate=29 December 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/north-east-news/history-newcastle-north-east/remember-when/2010/09/09/blue-plaques-map-shows-off-famous-spots-72703-27234399/ |title=Blue Plaques mapshows off famous spots |work=[[Evening Chronicle|Newcastle Evening Chronicle]] |first=Linda |last=Richards |date=9 September 2010 |accessdate=29 December 2012}}</ref> The Gateshead scheme aims to highlight notable persons who lived in the borough, notable buildings within it and important historical events.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gateshead.gov.uk/DocumentLibrary/Leisure/BluePlaqueleaflet.pdf |title=Gateshead's Commemorative Plaques |publisher=Gateshead Council |date=June 2012 |accessdate=29 December 2012}} at p.2</ref> Some of those commemorated through the scheme include [[George "Geordie" Ridley|Geordie Ridley]], author of the [[Blaydon Races]],<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gateshead.gov.uk/DocumentLibrary/Leisure/BluePlaqueleaflet.pdf |title=Gateshead's Commemorative Plaques |publisher=Gateshead Council |date=June 2012 |accessdate=29 December 2012}} at p.3</ref> [[William Wailes]], a noted 19th&nbsp;century proponent of stained glass who lived in a "fairytale mansion" at [[Saltwell Park]],<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/tyne/4096264.stm|title=Plaque honours famous ex-resident |publisher=[[BBC|the BBC]] |date=15 June 2005 |accessdate=29 December 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/tyne/3892855.stm |title=Fairytale mansion gets new life |work=[[BBC]]  |date=14 July 2004 |accessdate=29 November 2012}}</ref> the industrialist and co-founder of [[Clarke Chapman]], [[William Clarke (industrialist)|William Clarke]]<ref name="Gateshead's Commemorative Plaques">{{cite web |url=http://www.gateshead.gov.uk/DocumentLibrary/Leisure/BluePlaqueleaflet.pdf|title=Gateshead's Commemorative Plaques |publisher=Gateshead Council |date=June 2012 |accessdate=29 December 2012}} at p.8</ref> and [[Joseph Swan|Sir Joseph Swan]], the inventor of the [[incandescent light bulb]] whose [[Low Fell#Buildings and Landmarks|house in Low Fell]] was the first in the world to be illuminated by electric light.<ref name="Gateshead's Commemorative Plaques"/><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.localhistorygateshead.com/local-and-family-history/gateshead-blue-plaques/joseph-swan-1828--1914 |title=Gateshead Blue Plaques&nbsp;– Joseph Swan 1828–1914 |publisher=Gateshead Libraries |year=2011 |accessdate=29 December 2012 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130127231023/http://www.localhistorygateshead.com/local-and-family-history/gateshead-blue-plaques/joseph-swan-1828--1914 |archive-date=27 January 2013 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}</ref>

Further Gateshead blue plaques have since been erected.

In 2012, further blue plaques were unveiled in commemoration of [[Vincent Raven|Vincent Litchfield Raven]], an "engineering genius" who was the chief mechanical engineer at the [[North Eastern Railway (UK)|North Eastern Railway]] where his successes in steam engineering ultimately frustrated his own visionary work on the possibility of electric trains,<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/the-northerner/2012/mar/21/vincent-raven-electric-trains-steam-locomotives-gateshead |title=Gateshead honours an engineering giant whose genius has lessons for our times |work=[[The Guardian]] |first=Martin |last=Wainwright |date=21 March 2012 |accessdate=29 December 2012 |location=London}}</ref> and the 19th&nbsp;century [[Felling, Tyne and Wear#Felling Mining Disasters|Felling mining disasters]].<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-tyne-18194972 |title=Felling Pit Disaster remembered on 200th anniversary |publisher=[[BBC|the BBC]] |date=25 May 2012 |accessdate=29 December 2012}}</ref>

In 2017 in [[Aldershot]] in [[Hampshire]] the Aldershot Civic Society unveiled its first blue plaque to comedian and actor [[Arthur English]] at the house where he had been born. It is intended that this will be the first in a series dedicated to notable local people or historic buildings.<ref>[http://www.aldershotcivicsociety.org.uk/2017/05/31/blue-plaque-for-arthur-english/ Blue Plaque for Arthur English – Aldershot Civic Society website]</ref><ref>[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-hampshire-40617726 'Are You Being Served? actor Arthur English honoured with blue plaque' – BBC News Online – 15 July 2017]</ref><ref>[https://www.964eagle.co.uk/news/local-news/2330897/blue-plaque-unveiled-for-aldershots-arthur-english/ 'Blue plaque unveiled for Aldershot's Arthur English' – [[Eagle Radio]] – 15 July 2017]</ref>

==In other countries==
Commemorative plaque schemes (not all of them using blue plaques) also exist most notably in the cities of Paris, Rome, Oslo and Dublin.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://openplaques.org/places |title=Plaques by Country |accessdate=7 July 2011}}</ref>

In the United States, commemorative plaques similar to those used in Europe are called [[historical marker]]s. These vary in colour and design by state. The [[National Trust for Historic Preservation]] or the U.S. government, through the [[National Register of Historic Places]], can bestow historical status, with a small bronze marker affixed to the building.  Other markers are erected by state historical commissions and similar authorities, local governments or civic groups.  These can also be affixed to the building, but are frequently free-standing markers with the text on each side, or, in larger instances, beginning on one side and continuing to the other.

Most states in Australia have historic marker programs. For example, in [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]] all places and objects listed on the [[Victorian Heritage Register]] are entitled to a blue plaque.<ref>{{cite web |title=Blue Plaques |url=http://www.dpcd.vic.gov.au/heritage/heritage-places-and-objects/blue-plaques-how-to-obtain |publisher=Department of Planning and Community Development, Victoria |accessdate=14 February 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110225065540/http://www.dpcd.vic.gov.au/heritage/heritage-places-and-objects/blue-plaques-how-to-obtain |archive-date=25 February 2011 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}</ref> The Mechanics' Institutes of Victoria Inc. have also adopted a blue plaques program, and more than 30 Mechanics' Institutes throughout the state have installed plaques on their buildings.<ref>{{cite web |title=Historical Plaques Program |url=http://home.vicnet.net.au/~mivic/projects.htm |publisher=Mechanics' Institutes of Victoria Inc. |accessdate=13 January 2013}}</ref>

The Philippines have more than 1,500 [[Historical markers of the Philippines|historical markers]] installed for numerous personalities, places, structures, and events around the country. There are also a number of ones [[List of historical markers of the Philippines overseas|installed outside the country]]. The government agency tasked for this is the [[National Historical Commission of the Philippines]] (NHCP), although local government units can also install markers of local significance.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B9c6mrxI4zoYN0Ewdlk4WG9Ha28/view|title=GUIDELINES_IDENTIF CLASSIF AND RECOG OF HIST SITES & STRUCTS IN THE PHIL.pdf|work=Google Docs|access-date=2018-02-02}}</ref> The policy of installing markers started in 1933.<ref name=":12">{{Cite book|title=Historical Markers Placed by the Philippine Historical Committee|last=|first=|publisher=Bureau of Printing|year=1958|isbn=|location=Manila|pages=}}</ref> The initial markers were placed in 1934.
