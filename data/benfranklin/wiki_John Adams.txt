'''John Adams''' (October 30 &#91;[[Old Style and New Style dates|O.S.]] October 19,&nbsp;1735&nbsp;– July 4, 1826) was one of the [[Founding Fathers of the United States]]. He served as the first [[vice president of the United States|vice president]] (1789–1797) and second [[president of the United States]] (1797–1801). He was a lawyer, diplomat, and leader of American independence from [[Kingdom of Great Britain|Great Britain]]. Adams was a dedicated diarist, and correspondent with his wife and advisor [[Abigail Adams|Abigail]], recording important historical information on the era.

A political activist prior to the [[American Revolution]], Adams was devoted to the [[right to counsel]] and [[presumption of innocence]]. He defied anti-British sentiment and successfully defended British soldiers against murder charges arising from the [[Boston Massacre]]. Adams was a [[Province of Massachusetts Bay|Massachusetts]] delegate to the [[Continental Congress]] and became a principal leader of the Revolution. He assisted in drafting the [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]] in 1776 and was its foremost advocate in Congress. As a diplomat in Europe, he helped negotiate the [[Treaty of Paris (1783)|peace treaty]] with Great Britain and secured vital governmental loans. Adams was the primary author of the [[Massachusetts Constitution]] in 1780, which influenced the United States' own [[United States Constitution|constitution]], as did his earlier ''[[Thoughts on Government]]''.

Adams was elected to two terms as Vice President under [[George Washington]]. He was then elected President in [[United States presidential election, 1796|1796]]; during his single term, he encountered fierce criticism from the [[Jeffersonian Republicans]] and from some in his own [[Federalist Party]], led by his rival [[Alexander Hamilton]]. Adams signed the controversial [[Alien and Sedition Acts]] and built up the army and navy in the undeclared "[[Quasi-War]]" with France. The main accomplishment of his presidency was a [[Convention of 1800|peaceful resolution]] of this conflict in the face of public anger and Hamilton's opposition. He was the first president to reside in the executive mansion now known as the [[White House]].

Opposition from Federalists and accusations of despotism from Republicans led to Adams' [[United States presidential election, 1800|re-election]] loss to his former friend [[Thomas Jefferson]], and he retired to Massachusetts. He eventually resumed his friendship with Jefferson by initiating a correspondence that lasted fourteen years. He and his wife generated a family of politicians, diplomats, and historians now referred to as the [[Adams political family]], which includes their son [[John Quincy Adams]], the sixth president of the United States. John Adams died on the fiftieth anniversary of the adoption of the Declaration of Independence, hours after Jefferson's death. Surveys of historians and scholars have [[Historical rankings of presidents of the United States|favorably ranked his administration]].

==Early life and education==

===Childhood===
[[File:John Adams birthplace, Quincy, Massachusetts.JPG|thumb|right|Adams' birthplace in [[Quincy, Massachusetts]]|alt=Small wooden house with red-brick chimney in the middle]]
John Adams was born on October 30, 1735 (October 19, 1735, [[Old Style and New Style dates|Old Style]], [[Julian calendar]]) to [[John Adams Sr.]] and [[Susanna Boylston]]. He had two younger brothers, Peter and Elihu.{{sfn|Ferling|1992|p=11}} Adams was [[John Adams Birthplace|born on the family farm]] in [[Braintree, Massachusetts]].{{sfn|Ferling|1992|p=317}} His mother was from a leading medical family of present-day [[Brookline, Massachusetts]]. His father was a [[deacon]] in the [[Congregationalism in the United States|Congregational Church]], a farmer, a [[cordwainer]], and a lieutenant in the [[Massachusetts National Guard|militia]].{{sfn|McCullough|2001|pp=29–30}} John Sr. served as a [[Board of selectmen|selectman]] (town councilman) and supervised the building of schools and roads. Adams often praised his father and recalled their close relationship.{{sfn|Ferling|1992|pp=11–14}} Adams' great-grandfather [[Henry Adams (Braintree)|Henry Adams]] emigrated to Massachusetts from [[Braintree, Essex]], England around 1638.{{sfn|McCullough|2001|pp=29–30}}

Though raised in modest surroundings, Adams felt pressured to live up to his heritage. His was a family of [[Puritans]], who profoundly affected their region's culture, laws, and traditions. By the time of John Adams' birth, Puritan tenets such as [[predestination]] had waned and many of their severe practices moderated, but Adams still "considered them bearers of freedom, a cause that still had a holy urgency."{{sfn|Brookhiser|2002|p=13}} Adams recalled that his parents "held every Species of Libertinage in ... Contempt and horror," and detailed "pictures of disgrace, or baseness and of Ruin" resulting from any debauchery.{{sfn|Ferling|1992|p=11}} Adams later noted that, "As a child I enjoyed perhaps the greatest of blessings that can be bestowed upon men—that of a mother who was anxious and capable to form the characters of her children."{{sfn|Kirtley|1910|p=366}}

Adams, as the eldest child, was compelled to obtain a formal education. This began at age six at a [[Dame school]] for boys and girls, conducted at a teacher's home, and was centered upon ''[[The New England Primer]]''. Shortly thereafter, Adams attended Braintree Latin School under Joseph Cleverly, where studies included [[Latin]], rhetoric, logic, and arithmetic. Adams' early education included incidents of [[truancy]], a dislike for his master, and a desire to become a farmer. All discussion on the matter ended with his father's command that he remain in school: "You shall comply with my desires." Deacon Adams hired a new schoolmaster named Joseph Marsh, and his son responded positively.{{sfn|Ferling|1992|pp=12–14}}

===College education and adulthood===
At age sixteen, Adams entered [[Harvard College]] in 1751, studying under [[Joseph Mayhew]].{{sfn|McCullough|2001|p=35}} As an adult, Adams was a keen scholar, studying the works of ancient writers such as [[Thucydides]], [[Plato]], [[Cicero]], and [[Tacitus]] in their original languages.{{sfn|McCullough|2001|p=13}} Though his father expected him to be a minister,{{sfn|Ferling|1992|p=16}} after his 1755 graduation with an [[Bachelor of Arts|A.B. degree]], he taught school temporarily in [[Worcester, Massachusetts|Worcester]], Massachusetts, while pondering his permanent vocation. In the next four years, he began to seek prestige, craving "Honour or Reputation" and "more {{sic|def|ference|hide=y}} from [his] fellows", and was determined to be "a great Man." He decided to become a lawyer to further those ends, writing his father that he found among lawyers "noble and gallant achievements" but, among the clergy, the "pretended sanctity of some absolute dunces." His aspirations conflicted with his Puritanism, though, prompting reservations about his self-described "trumpery" and failure to share the "happiness of [his] fellow men."{{sfn|Ferling|1992|pp=17–18}}

As the [[French and Indian War]] began in 1754, Adams, aged nineteen, began to struggle with his responsibility in the conflict as his many of his contemporaries joined the war for money. Adams later said, "I longed more ardently to be a Soldier than I ever did to be a Lawyer," recognizing that he was the first of his family to "[degenerate] from the virtues of the house so far as not to have been an officer in the militia."{{sfn|Ferling|1992|p=21}}

}}
In 1756, Adams began [[reading law]] under John Putnam, a leading lawyer in Worcester.{{sfn|Ferling|1992|p=19}} In 1758, he earned an [[Master of Arts|A.M.]] from Harvard,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2008/11/obama-joins-list-of-seven-presidents-with-harvard-degrees/ |title=Obama joins list of seven presidents with Harvard degrees |publisher=''The Harvard Gazette'' |date=November 6, 2008 |accessdate=December 5, 2011 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160801190338/http://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2008/11/obama-joins-list-of-seven-presidents-with-harvard-degrees/ |archivedate=August 1, 2016 |df=mdy-all}}</ref> and was soon admitted to the bar, having completed his studies under Putnam.{{sfn|McCullough|2001|p=44}} He developed an early habit of writing about events and impressions of men in his diary; this included [[James Otis Jr.|James Otis Jr.'s]] 1761 legal argument challenging the legality of British [[Writ of assistance|Writs of Assistance]], allowing the British to search a home without notice or reason. Otis's argument inspired Adams to the cause of the American colonies.{{sfn|Ferling|1992|p=46}}

In 1763, Adams forged into various aspects of political theory by publishing seven essays in Boston newspapers. He offered them anonymously, under the [[nom de plume]] "Humphrey Ploughjogger", and in them ridiculed the selfish thirst for power he perceived among the Massachusetts colonial elite.{{sfn|Ferling|1992|pp=36–39}} Adams was initially less well known than his older cousin [[Samuel Adams]], but his influence emerged from his work as a constitutional lawyer, his analysis of history, and his dedication to [[republicanism]]. Adams often found his irascible nature a constraint in his political career.{{sfn|Ferling|1992|p=16}}

In the late 1750s, Adams fell in love with Hannah Quincy; while they were alone, he was poised to propose, but was interrupted by friends, and the moment was lost. In 1759, he met 15-year-old [[Abigail Adams|Abigail Smith]] through his friend Richard Cranch, who was courting Abigail's older sister. Adams initially was not impressed with Abigail and her two sisters, writing that they were not "fond, nor frank, nor candid."{{sfn|McCullough|2001|pp=51–52}} In time they grew close and were married on October 25, 1764, despite the opposition of Abigail's haughty mother. They shared a love of books, and kindred personalities that proved honest in their praise and criticism of each other. After his father's death in 1761, Adams had inherited a {{cvt|9+1/2|acre|ha|adj=on}} farm and [[John Quincy Adams Birthplace|a house]] where they lived until 1783.<ref name=Life1961 />{{sfn|McCullough|2001|pp=55–56}} John and Abigail had six children: [[Abigail Adams Smith|Abigail]] "Nabby" in 1765,{{sfn|McCullough|2001|p=58}} future president [[John Quincy Adams]] in 1767,{{sfn|Ferling|1992|p=57}} Susanna in 1768, [[Charles Adams (1770–1800)|Charles]] in 1770, [[Thomas Boylston Adams (1772–1832)|Thomas]] in 1772,{{sfn|Ferling|1992|p=71}} and Elizabeth in 1777.{{sfn|McCullough|2001|pp=171–172}} Susanna died when she was one year old,{{sfn|Ferling|1992|p=71}} while Elizabeth was stillborn.{{sfn|McCullough|2001|pp=171–172}} All three of his sons became lawyers; Charles and Thomas were unsuccessful, became alcoholics, and died young, while John Quincy excelled and launched a career in politics. Adams' writings are devoid of his feelings about the sons' fates.{{sfn|McCullough|2001|pp=634–35}}

==Career before the Revolution==

===Opponent of Stamp Act===
Adams rose to prominence leading widespread opposition to the [[Stamp Act 1765|Stamp Act of 1765]]. The Act was imposed by the British Parliament without consulting the American legislatures. It required payment of a direct tax by the colonies for stamped documents,<ref name="Declaration of Independence">{{cite web |url=https://www.archives.gov/founding-docs/declaration-transcript |title=Declaration of Independence: A Transcription |publisher=United States National Archives |access-date=October 1, 2018|date=November 2015 }}</ref><ref name="Stamp Act">{{cite web |url=http://www.john-adams-heritage.com/political-activism/|title=Stamp Act and the beginning of political activism |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160614042234/http://www.john-adams-heritage.com/political-activism/ |publisher=John Adams Historical Society |archivedate=June 14, 2016|deadurl=no|accessdate=2016-07-05|df=mdy-all}}</ref> and was designed to pay for the costs of Britain's war with France. Power of enforcement was given to British Vice Admiralty Courts, rather than [[common law]] courts.{{sfn|Smith|1962a|pp=72–76}}<ref name="Stamp Act"/> These Admiralty courts acted without juries and were greatly disliked.<ref name="Declaration of Independence"/> The Act was despised for both its monetary cost and implementation without colonial consent, and encountered violent resistance, preventing its enforcement.{{sfn|Smith|1962a|pp=72–76}} Adams authored the "[[Braintree Instructions]]" in 1765, in the form of a letter sent to the representatives of Braintree in the Massachusetts legislature. In it he explained that the Act should be opposed since it denied two fundamental rights guaranteed to all Englishmen (and which all free men deserved): rights to be taxed only by consent and to be tried by a jury of one's peers. The instructions were a succinct and forthright defense of colonial rights and liberties, and served as a model for other towns' instructions.{{sfn|Ferling|1992|pp=55–56}}

Adams also reprised his pen name "Humphrey Ploughjogger" in opposition to the Stamp Act in August of that year. Included were four articles to the ''[[Boston Gazette]]''. The articles were republished in ''The London Chronicle'' in 1768 as ''True Sentiments of America'', also known as ''A Dissertation on the Canon and Feudal Law''. He also spoke in December before the governor and council, pronouncing the Stamp Act invalid in the absence of Massachusetts representation at Parliament.{{sfn|Ferling|1992|p=39}}{{sfn|McCullough|2001|pp=59–61}} He noted that many protests were sparked by a popular sermon of Boston minister [[Jonathan Mayhew]], invoking [[Epistle to the Romans|Romans 13]] to justify insurrection.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.teachingamericanhistory.org/library/index.asp?document=905|title=Discourse Concerning Unlimited Submission and Non-resistance to the Higher Powers|first=Rev. Jonathan|last=Mayhew|publisher=Ashbrook Center|year=1750|accessdate=August 22, 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130415082838/http://teachingamericanhistory.org/library/index.asp?document=905|archivedate=April 15, 2013|df=mdy-all}}</ref> While Adams took a strong stand against the Act in writing, he rebuffed attempts by Samuel Adams, a leader in the popular protest movements, to involve him in mob actions and public demonstrations.{{sfn|Ferling|1992|pp=47–49}} In 1766, a town meeting of Braintree elected Adams as a selectman.{{sfn|McCullough|2001|p=63}}

With the repeal of the Stamp Act in early 1766, tensions with Britain temporarily eased.{{sfn|McCullough|2001|pp=62–63}} Putting politics aside, Adams moved his family to Boston in April 1768 to focus on his law practice. The family rented a clapboard house on [[Brattle Street (Boston)|Brattle Street]] that was known locally as the "White House". He, Abigail, and the children lived there for a year, then moved to Cold Lane; still later, they moved again to a larger house in Brattle Square in the center of the city.{{sfn|Ferling|1992|p=57}} With the death of [[Jeremiah Gridley]] and mental collapse of Otis, Adams became Boston's most prominent lawyer.{{sfn|McCullough|2001|p=63}}

===Counsel for the British: Boston Massacre===
[[File:BostonMassacre byAlonzoChappel1878.png|thumb|Boston Massacre of 1770 by Alonzo Chappel (1878)|alt=Depiction of chaotic confrontation between British soldiers and Bostonians]]
Britain's passage of the [[Townshend Acts]] in 1767 revived tensions, and an increase in mob violence led the British to dispatch more troops to the colonies.{{sfn|Ferling|1992|pp=57–59}} On March 5, 1770, when a lone British sentry was accosted by an mob of citizens, eight of his fellow [[29th (Worcestershire) Regiment of Foot|soldiers]] reinforced him, and the crowd around them grew to several hundred. The soldiers were struck with snowballs, ice, and stones, and in the chaos the soldiers opened fire, killing five civilians, bringing about the infamous [[Boston Massacre]]. The accused soldiers were arrested on charges of murder. When no other attorneys would come to their defense, Adams was impelled to do so despite the risk to his reputation—he believed no person should be denied the right to counsel and a fair trial. The trials were delayed so that passions could cool.{{sfn|McCullough|2001|pp=65–66}}

The week-long trial of the commander, Captain [[Thomas Preston (British Army officer)|Thomas Preston]], began on October 24 and ended in his acquittal, because it was impossible to prove that he had ordered his soldiers to fire.{{sfn|Morse|1884|p=39}} The remaining soldiers were tried in December, when Adams made his legendary argument regarding jury decisions: "Facts are stubborn things; and whatever may be our wishes, our inclinations, or the dictates of our passion, they cannot alter the state of facts and evidence."<ref>{{cite book |last=Adams |first=John |title=Argument in Defense of the Soldiers in the Boston Massacre Trials |url=https://founders.archives.gov/documents/Adams/05-03-02-0001-0004-0016 |publisher=Adams Papers, Massachusetts Historical Society |date=December 1770 |access-date=July 29, 2018}}</ref> He added, "It is more important that innocence be protected than it is that guilt be punished, for guilt and crimes are so frequent in this world that they cannot all be punished. But if innocence itself is brought to the bar and condemned, perhaps to die, then the citizen will say, 'whether I do good or whether I do evil is immaterial, for innocence itself is no protection,' and if such an idea as that were to take hold in the mind of the citizen that would be the end of security whatsoever." Adams won acquittal for six of the soldiers. Two, who had fired directly into the crowd, were convicted of manslaughter. Adams was paid a small sum by his clients.<ref name=Life1961>{{cite magazine |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |date=June 30, 1961 |title=Private Thoughts of a Founding Father |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=V1QEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA82 |magazine=[[Life (magazine)|Life]] |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150407141509/http://books.google.com/books?id=V1QEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA82 |archivedate=April 7, 2015 |access-date=June 7, 2015 |page=82 }}</ref>

According to biographer [[John E. Ferling]], during [[Voir dire|jury selection]] Adams "expertly exercised his right to challenge individual jurors and contrived what amounted to a packed jury. Not only were several jurors closely tied through business arrangements to the British army, but five ultimately became Loyalist exiles." While Adams' defense was helped by a weak prosecution, he also "performed brilliantly."{{sfn|Ferling|1992|p=69}} Ferling surmises that Adams may have been encouraged to take the case in exchange for political office; one of Boston's seats opened three months later in the Massachusetts legislature, and Adams was the town's first choice to fill the vacancy.{{sfn|Ferling|1992|pp=67–68}}

The prosperity of his law practice increased from this exposure, as did the demands on his time. In 1771, Adams moved his family to Braintree, but kept his office in Boston. He noted on the day of the family's move, "Now my family is away, I feel no Inclination at all, no Temptation, to be any where but at my Office. I am in it by 6 in the Morning – I am in it at 9 at night. ... In the Evening, I can be alone at my Office, and no where else." After some time in the capital, he became disenchanted with the rural and "vulgar" Braintree as a home for his family—in August 1772, he moved them back to Boston. He purchased a large brick house on [[Court Street (Boston)|Queen Street]], not far from his office.{{sfn|Ferling|1992|p=74}} In 1774, Adams and Abigail returned the family to the farm due to the increasingly unstable situation in Boston, and Braintree remained their permanent Massachusetts home.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/adams/peopleevents/p_callender.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150906091054/http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/adams/peopleevents/p_callender.html |archivedate=2015-09-06 |title=American Experience – John & Abigail Adams – Timeline |publisher=PBS |access-date=September 7, 2015}}</ref>

===Becoming a revolutionary===
Adams, who had been among the more conservative of the Founders, persistently held that while British actions against the colonies had been wrong and misguided, open insurrection was unwarranted and peaceful petition with the ultimate view of remaining part of Great Britain was a better alternative.{{sfn|Ferling|1992|pp=72–73}} His ideas began to change around 1772, as the British Crown assumed payment of the salaries of Governor [[Thomas Hutchinson (governor)|Thomas Hutchinson]] and his judges instead of the Massachusetts legislature. Adams wrote in the ''Gazette'' that these measures would destroy judicial independence and place the colonial government in closer subjugation to the Crown. After discontent among members of the legislature, Hutchinson delivered a speech warning that Parliament's powers over the colonies were absolute and that any resistance was illegal. Subsequently, John Adams, Samuel, and [[Joseph Hawley (Massachusetts)|Joseph Hawley]] drafted a resolution adopted by the House of Representatives threatening independence as an alternative to tyranny. The resolution argued that the colonists had never been under the sovereignty of Parliament. Their original charter, as well as their allegiance, was exclusively with the King.{{sfn|Ferling|1992|pp=78–80}}

The [[Boston Tea Party]], a historic demonstration against the British [[East India Company]]'s tea monopoly over American merchants, took place on December 16, 1773. The British schooner ''Dartmouth'', loaded with tea to be traded subject to the new [[Tea Act]], had previously dropped anchor in Boston harbor. By 9:00 PM, the work of the protesters was done – they had demolished 342 chests of tea worth about ten thousand pounds, the 1992 equivalent of about $1 million. The ''Dartmouth'' owners briefly retained Adams as legal counsel regarding their liability for the destroyed shipment. Adams himself applauded the destruction of the tea, calling it the "grandest Event" in the history of the colonial protest movement,{{sfn|Ferling|1992|pp=92–94}} and writing in his diary that the dutied tea's destruction was an "absolutely and indispensably" necessary action.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://founders.archives.gov/?q=absolutely%20and%20indispensably&s=1511311111&sa=&r=2&sr=|title=1773.

Adams is depicted at center with his hand on his hip.|alt=depicts the five-man committee presenting the draft of the Declaration of Independence to Congress.|alt=56 figures stand or sit in a room. Five lay papers on a table.]]

In 1774, at the instigation of Samuel Adams, the [[First Continental Congress]] was convened in response to the [[Intolerable Acts]], a series of deeply unpopular measures intended to punish Massachusetts, centralize authority in Britain, and prevent rebellion in other colonies. Four delegates were chosen by the Massachusetts legislature, including Adams, who agreed to attend,{{sfn|Ferling|1992|pp=95–97}} despite an emotional plea from his friend [[Jonathan Sewall]] not to.{{sfn|McCullough|2001|p=71}}

Shortly after he arrived in Philadelphia, Adams was placed on the 23-member Grand Committee tasked with drafting a letter of grievances to [[George III of the United Kingdom|King George III]]. The members of the committee soon split into conservative and radical factions.{{sfn|Ferling|1992|pp=107–108}} Although the Massachusetts delegation was largely passive, Adams criticized conservatives such as [[Joseph Galloway]], [[James Duane]], and [[Peter Oliver (loyalist)|Peter Oliver]] who advocated a conciliatory policy towards the British or felt that the colonies had a duty to remain loyal to Britain, although his views at the time did align with those of conservative [[John Dickinson (Pennsylvania and Delaware)|John Dickinson]].

Adams' absence from home was hard on Abigail, who was left alone to care for the family. She still encouraged her husband in his task, writing: "You cannot be, I know, nor do I wish to see you an inactive Spectator, but if the Sword be drawn I bid adieu to all domestick felicity, and look forward to that Country where there is neither wars nor rumors of War in a firm belief that thro the mercy of its King we shall both rejoice there together."<ref>{{cite web |url=https://founders.archives.gov/documents/Adams/04-01-02-0116 |title=Abigail Adams to John Adams, 16 October 1774 |publisher=Adams Papers, Massachusetts Historical Society |access-date=September 22, 2017}}</ref>

News of the opening hostilities with the British at the [[Battles of Lexington and Concord]] made Adams hope that independence would soon become a reality. Three days after the battle, he rode into a militia camp and, while reflecting positively on the high spirits of the men, was distressed by their poor condition and lack of discipline.{{sfn|Smith|1962a|p=196}} A month later, Adams returned to Philadelphia for the [[Second Continental Congress]] as the leader of the Massachusetts delegation.{{sfn|McCullough|2001|pp=87–88}} He moved cautiously at first, noting that the Congress was divided between [[Loyalist (American Revolution)|Loyalists]], those favoring independence, and those hesitant to take any position.{{sfn|McCullough|2001|p=90}} He became convinced that Congress was moving in the proper direction – away from Great Britain. Publicly, Adams supported "reconciliation if practicable," but privately agreed with [[Benjamin Franklin]]'s confidential observation that independence was inevitable.{{sfn|Ferling|1992|p=136}}

In June 1775, with a view of promoting union among the colonies against Great Britain, he nominated [[George Washington]] of Virginia as commander-in-chief of the [[Continental Army|army]] then assembled around Boston.<ref name="Time Line">{{cite web|url=http://masshist.org/adams/timeline.cfm |title=Adams Time Line |publisher=Massachusetts Historical Society |accessdate=August 22, 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090324015852/http://masshist.org/adams/timeline.cfm |archivedate=March 24, 2009 }}</ref> He praised Washington's "skill and experience" as well as his "excellent universal character."{{sfn|Ferling|1992|p=124}} Adams opposed various attempts, including the [[Olive Branch Petition]], aimed at trying to find peace between the colonies and Great Britain.{{sfn|McCullough|2001|pp=94–95}} Invoking the already-long list of British actions against the colonies, he wrote, "In my opinion Powder and Artillery are the most efficacious, Sure, and infallibly conciliatory Measures We can adopt."<ref>{{cite web |url=https://founders.archives.gov/documents/Adams/06-03-02-0014 |title=From John Adams to Moses Gill, 10 June 1775 |publisher=Adams Papers, Massachusetts Historical Society |access-date=October 11, 2017}}</ref> After his failure to prevent the petition from being enacted, he wrote a private letter derisively referring to Dickinson as a "piddling genius."

===Independence===
Throughout the first half of 1776, Adams grew increasingly impatient with what he perceived to be the slow pace of declaring independence.{{sfn|Smith|1962a|p=263}} He kept busy on the floor of the Congress, helping push through a plan to outfit armed ships to launch raids on enemy vessels. Later in the year, he drafted the first set of regulations to govern the provisional navy.{{sfn|McCullough|2001|pp=99–100}} Adams drafted the preamble to the [[Lee resolution]] of colleague [[Richard Henry Lee]].{{sfn|Maier|1998|p=37}} He developed a rapport with Delegate [[Thomas Jefferson]] of Virginia, who had been slower to support independence but by early 1776 agreed that it was necessary.{{sfn|McCullough|2001|pp=113–117}} On June 7, 1776, Adams seconded the resolution, which stated, "These colonies are, and of right ought to be, free and independent states."{{sfn|Ferling|1992|p=146}}

Prior to independence being declared, Adams organized and selected a [[Committee of Five]] charged with drafting a Declaration of Independence. He chose himself, Jefferson, Benjamin Franklin, [[Robert R. Livingston (chancellor)|Robert R. Livingston]] and [[Roger Sherman]].{{sfn|Boyd|Gawalt|1999|p=21}} Jefferson thought Adams should write the document, but Adams persuaded the Committee to choose Jefferson. Adams recorded his exchange with Jefferson on the question: Jefferson asked, "Why will you not? You ought to do it." To which Adams responded, "I will not – reasons enough." Jefferson replied, "What can be your reasons?" And Adams responded, "Reason first, you are a Virginian, and a Virginian ought to appear at the head of this business. Reason second, I am obnoxious, suspected, and unpopular. You are very much otherwise. Reason third, you can write ten times better than I can." "Well," said Jefferson, "if you are decided, I will do as well as I can."{{sfn|McCullough|2001|p=119}} The Committee left no minutes, and the drafting process itself remains uncertain. Accounts written many years later by Jefferson and Adams, although frequently cited, are often contradictory.{{sfn|Maier|1998|pp=97–105}} Although the first draft was written primarily by Jefferson, Adams assumed a major role in its completion.{{sfn|McCullough|2001|pp=130–135}} On July 1, the resolution was debated in Congress. It was expected to pass, but opponents such as Dickinson made a strong effort to oppose it anyhow. Jefferson, a poor debater, remained silent while Adams argued for its adoption.{{sfn|Morse|1884|pp=127–128}} Many years later, Jefferson hailed Adams as "the pillar of [the Declaration's] support on the floor of Congress, [its] ablest advocate and defender against the multifarious assaults it encountered."<ref>Jefferson, Thomas. To William P. Gardner. ''The Works of Thomas Jefferson''. Federal Edition (New York and London, G.P. Putnam's Sons, 1904–05). Vol. 11.</ref> After editing [[United States Declaration of Independence|the document]] further, Congress approved it on July 2. Twelve colonies voted in the affirmative, while New York abstained. Dickinson was absent.{{sfn|McCullough|2001|p=136}} On July 3, Adams wrote to Abigail that "yesterday was decided the greatest question which was ever debated in America, and a greater perhaps never was nor will be decided among men." He predicted that "[t]he second day of July, 1776, will be the most memorable epoch in the history of America," and would be commemorated annually with great festivities.{{sfn|Morse|1884|p=128}}

After defeating the [[Continental Army]] at the [[Battle of Long Island]] on August 27, British Admiral [[Richard Howe, 1st Earl Howe|Richard Howe]] determined that a strategic advantage was at hand, and requested that Congress send representatives to negotiate peace. A delegation, including Adams and Benjamin Franklin, met with Howe at the [[Staten Island Peace Conference]] on September 11.{{sfn|McCullough|2001|pp=153–157}} Howe's authority was premised on the states' submission, so the parties found no common ground. When Lord Howe stated he could only view the American delegates as British subjects, Adams replied, "Your lordship may consider me in what light you please, ... except that of a British subject."{{sfn|McCullough|2001|p=157}} Adams learned many years later that his name was on a list of people specifically excluded from Howe's pardon-granting authority.{{sfn|McCullough|2001|p=158}} Adams was unimpressed with Howe and predicted American success.{{sfn|Ferling|1992|pp=164–65}}

In 1775, Adams became head of the [[Board of War and Ordnance]], charged with keeping accurate record of the officers in the army and their ranks, the disposition of troops throughout the colonies, and ammunition.{{sfn|Smith|1962a|p=267}} He sat on ninety committees, chairing twenty-five, an unmatched workload among the congressmen. As Benjamin Rush reported, he was acknowledged "to be the first man in the House."{{sfn|McCullough|2001|p=163}} He was referred to as a "one man war department," working up to eighteen-hour days and mastering the details of raising, equipping and fielding an army under civilian control. He authored the "Plan of Treaties," laying out the Congress's requirements for a treaty with France.{{sfn|Ellis|1993|pp=41–42}}

==Diplomatic service==
{{main|Diplomacy of John Adams}}

===Commissioner to France===
Before the signing of the Declaration of Independence in 1776, Adams advocated in Congress that independence was necessary to establish trade, and conversely trade was essential for the attainment of independence; he specifically urged negotiation of a commercial treaty with France. He was then appointed, along with Franklin, Dickinson, [[Benjamin Harrison V|Benjamin Harrison]] of Virginia and Robert Morris of Pennsylvania, "to prepare a plan of treaties to be proposed to foreign powers." While Jefferson was laboring over the Declaration of Independence, Adams worked on the [[Model Treaty]]. The Model Treaty authorized a commercial agreement with France but contained no provisions for formal recognition or military assistance. There were provisions for what constituted French territory. The treaty adhered to the provision that "[[freedom of navigation|free ships make free goods]]," allowing neutral nations to trade reciprocally while exempting an agreed upon list of contraband. By late 1777, America's finances were in tatters, and that September a British army had [[Battle of Brandywine|defeated]] General Washington and captured Philadelphia. More Americans came to determine that mere commercial ties between the U.S. and France would not be enough, and that military assistance would be needed to end the war. The defeat of the British at [[Battles of Saratoga|Saratoga]] was expected to help induce France to agree to an alliance.{{sfn|Ferling|1992|pp=189–190}}

In November, Adams learned that he was to be named commissioner to France, replacing [[Silas Deane]] and joining Franklin and [[Arthur Lee (diplomat)|Arthur Lee]] in Paris to negotiate an alliance with the hesitant French. [[James Lovell (Continental Congress)|James Lovell]] invoked Adams' "inflexible integrity" and the need to have a youthful man who could counterbalance Franklin's advanced age. On November 27, Adams accepted, wasting no time. He wrote to Lovell that he "should have wanted no motives or arguments" for his acceptance if he "could be sure that the public would be benefited by it." Abigail was left in Massachusetts to manage their home, but it was agreed that 10-year-old John Quincy would go with Adams, for the experience was "of inestimable value" to his maturation.{{sfn|McCullough|2001|pp=174–176}} On February 17, Adams set sail aboard the [[frigate]] ''[[USS Boston (1777)|Boston]]'', commanded by Captain [[Samuel Tucker]].{{sfn|McCullough|2001|pp=177–179}} The trip was stormy and treacherous. Lightning injured 19 sailors and killed one. The ship was pursued by several British vessels, with Adams taking up arms to help capture one. A cannon malfunction killed one and injured five of the crew.{{sfn|McCullough|2001|p=186}} On April 1, the ''Boston'' arrived in Spain, where Adams learned that France had agreed to an [[Treaty of Alliance (1778)|alliance]] with the United States on February 6.{{sfn|McCullough|2001|p=187}} Shortly after, they arrived in France.{{sfn|McCullough|2001|p=189}} Adams was annoyed by the other two commissioners: Lee, whom he thought paranoid and cynical, and the popular and influential Franklin, whom he found lethargic and overly deferential and accommodating to the French.{{sfn|McCullough|2001|pp=198, 209}} He assumed a less visible role but helped manage the delegation's finances and record-keeping.{{sfn|Ferling|1992|p=199}} Frustrated by the perceived lack of commitment on the part of the French, Adams wrote a letter to French foreign minister [[Charles Gravier, comte de Vergennes|Vergennes]] in December, arguing for French naval support in North America. Franklin toned down the letter, but Vergennes still ignored it.{{sfn|McCullough|2001|p=210}} In September 1778, Congress increased Franklin's powers by naming him [[minister plenipotentiary]] to France while Lee was sent to Spain. Adams received no instructions. Frustrated by the apparent slight, he departed France with John Quincy on March 8, 1779.{{sfn|McCullough|2001|pp=210–213}} On August 2, they arrived in Braintree.{{sfn|McCullough|2001|p=218}}

[[File:Joseph Siffrein Duplessis - Benjamin Franklin - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Adams frequently clashed with [[Benjamin Franklin]] over how to manage French relations.]]
In late 1779, Adams was appointed as the sole minister charged with negotiations to establish a commercial treaty with Britain and end the war.{{sfn|Ferling|1992|p=221}} Following the conclusion of the Massachusetts constitutional convention, he departed for France in November{{sfn|Smith|1962a|p=451}} aboard the French frigate ''Sensible'' – accompanied by John Quincy and 9-year-old son Charles. Constant disagreement between Lee and Franklin eventually resulted in Adams assuming the role of tie-breaker in almost all votes on commission business. He increased his usefulness by mastering the French language. Lee was eventually recalled. Adams closely supervised his sons' education while writing to Abigail about once every ten days.{{sfn|Ferling|1992|pp=218–222}}

In contrast to Franklin, Adams viewed the Franco-American alliance pessimistically. The French, he believed, were involved for their own self-interest, and he grew frustrated by what he saw as their sluggishness in providing substantial aid to the Revolution. The French, Adams wrote, meant to keep their hands "above our chin to prevent us from drowning, but not to lift our heads out of water."{{sfn|McCullough|2001|p=233}} In March 1780, Congress, trying to curb inflation, voted to devalue the dollar. Vergennes summoned Adams for a meeting. In a letter sent in June, he insisted that any fluctuation of the dollar value without an exception for French merchants was unacceptable and requested that Adams write to Congress asking it to "retrace its steps." Adams bluntly defended the decision, not only claiming that the French merchants were doing better than Vergennes implied, but voicing other grievances he had with the French. The alliance had been made over two years before. During that period, an army under the [[Jean-Baptiste Donatien de Vimeur, comte de Rochambeau|comte de Rochambeau]] had been sent to assist Washington, but it had yet to do anything of significance and America was expecting French warships. These were needed, Adams wrote, to contain the British armies in the port cities and contend with the powerful British Navy. However, the French Navy had been sent not to the United States but to the West Indies to protect French interests there. France, Adams believed, needed to commit itself more fully to the alliance. Vergennes responded that he would deal only with Franklin, who sent a letter back to Congress critical of Adams.{{sfn|McCullough|2001|pp=239–241}} Adams then left France of his own accord.{{sfn|McCullough|2001|p=242}}

===Ambassador to the Dutch Republic===
In mid-1780, Adams travelled to the [[Dutch Republic]]. One of the few other existing republics at the time, Adams thought it might be sympathetic to the American cause. Securing a Dutch loan could increase American independence from France and pressure Britain into peace. At first, Adams had no official status, but in July he was formally given permission to negotiate for a loan and took up residence in [[Amsterdam]] in August. Adams was originally optimistic and greatly enjoyed the city, but soon became disappointed. The Dutch, fearing British retaliation, refused to meet Adams. Before he had arrived, the British found out about secret aid the Dutch had sent to the Americans, the British authorized reprisals against their ships, which only increased their apprehension. Word had also reached Europe of American battlefield defeats. After five months of not meeting with a single Dutch official, Adams in early 1781 pronounced Amsterdam "the capital of the reign of [[Mammon]]."{{sfn|Ferling|1992|pp=228–230}} He was finally invited to present his credentials as ambassador to the Dutch government at [[The Hague]] on April 19, 1781, but they did not promise any assistance. In the meantime, Adams thwarted an attempt by neutral European powers to mediate the war without consulting the United States.{{sfn|McCullough|2001|pp=254–255}} In July, Adams consented to the departure of both of his sons; John Quincy went with Adams' secretary [[Francis Dana]] to [[Saint Petersburg]] as a [[French language|French]] interpreter, in an effort to seek recognition from [[Russia]], and a homesick Charles returned home with Adams' friend [[Benjamin Waterhouse]].{{sfn|McCullough|2001|p=262}} In August, shortly after being removed from his position of sole head of peace treaty negotiations, Adams fell seriously ill in "a major nervous breakdown."{{sfn|Ferling|1992|p=236}} That November, he learned that American and French troops had decisively defeated the British at [[Siege of Yorktown|Yorktown]]. The victory was in large part due to the assistance of the French Navy, which vindicated Adams' stand for increased naval assistance.{{sfn|Ferling|1992|pp=239–240}}

News of the American triumph at Yorktown convulsed Europe. In January 1782, after recovering, Adams arrived at The Hague to demand that the [[States General of the Netherlands]] answer his petitions. His efforts stalled, and he took his cause to the people, successfully capitalizing on popular pro-American sentiment to push the States General towards recognizing the U.S. Several provinces began recognizing American independence. On April 19, the States General in The Hague formally recognized American independence and acknowledged Adams as ambassador.{{sfn|McCullough|2001|pp=268–270}} On June 11, with the aid of the Dutch [[Patriottentijd|''Patriotten'']] leader [[Joan van der Capellen tot den Pol]], Adams negotiated a loan of five million guilders. In October, he negotiated with the Dutch a treaty of amity and commerce.{{sfn|McCullough|2001|pp=171–173}} The house that Adams bought during this stay in the [[Netherlands]] became the first American embassy on foreign soil.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://thehague.usembassy.gov/friendship_days2.html |title=Dutch American Friendship Day / Heritage Day – U.S. Embassy The Hague, Netherlands |publisher=U.S. Embassy |date=November 16, 1991 |accessdate=2010-03-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100527103140/http://thehague.usembassy.gov/friendship_days2.html |archivedate=May 27, 2010 |df= }}</ref>

===Treaty of Paris===
After negotiating the loan with the Dutch, Adams was re-appointed as the American commissioner to negotiate the war-ending treaty, the [[Treaty of Paris (1783)|Treaty of Paris]]. Vergennes still disapproved of Adams, so Franklin, Thomas Jefferson, [[John Jay]], and [[Henry Laurens]] were appointed to collaborate with Adams, although Jefferson did not go to Europe and Laurens was posted to the Dutch Republic.<ref>Ferling, ch. 11–12.</ref>

In the final negotiations, securing fishing rights off [[Newfoundland]] and [[Cape Breton Island]] proved both very important and very difficult. In response to very strict restrictions proposed by the British, Adams insisted that not only should American fishermen be allowed to travel as close to shore as desired, but that they should be allowed to cure their fish on the shores of Newfoundland.{{sfn|Smith|1962a|pp=545–546}} This, and other statements, prompted Vergennes to secretly inform the British that France did not feel compelled to "sustain [these] pretentious ambitions." Overruling Franklin and distrustful of Vergennes, Jay and Adams decided not to consult with France, instead dealing directly with the British.{{sfn|McCullough|2001|pp=281–284}} During these negotiations, Adams mentioned to the British that his proposed fishing terms were more generous than those offered by France in 1778, and that accepting would foster good will between Britain and the United States while putting pressure on France. Britain agreed, and the two sides worked out other provisions afterwards. Vergennes was angered when he learned from Franklin of the American duplicity, but did not demand renegotiation,{{sfn|Smith|1962a|pp=546–547}} and was supposedly surprised at how much the Americans could extract. The independent negotiations allowed the French to plead innocence to their Spanish allies, whose demands for [[Gibraltar]] might have caused significant problems.{{sfn|Smith|1962a|pp=546–547}} On September 3, 1783, the treaty was signed and American independence was recognized.{{sfn|McCullough|2001|p=285}}

===Ambassador to Great Britain===

Adams was appointed the first American ambassador to Great Britain in 1785. When a counterpart assumed that Adams had family in England, Adams replied, "Neither my father or mother, grandfather or grandmother, great grandfather or great grandmother, nor any other relation that I know of, or care a farthing for, has been in England these one hundred and fifty years; so that you see I have not one drop of blood in my veins but what is American."{{sfn|Adams|Adams|1851|p=392}}

[[File:JohnAdams.png|thumb|left|Portrait by Mather Brown|right|Adams – 1785 [[Mather Brown]] Portrait]]After arriving in London from Paris, Adams had his first audience with King George III on June 1, which he meticulously recorded in a letter to Foreign Minister Jay the next day. The pair's exchange was respectful; Adams promised to do all that he could to restore friendship and cordiality "between People who, tho Seperated [sic] by an Ocean and under different Governments have the Same Language, a Similar Religion and kindred Blood," and the King agreed to "receive with Pleasure, the Assurances of the friendly Dispositions of the United States." The King added that although "he had been the last to consent" to American independence, he wanted Adams to know that he had always done what he thought was right. Towards its end, he startled Adams by commenting that "There is an Opinion, among Some People, that you are not the most attached of all Your Countrymen, to the manners of France." Adams replied, "That Opinion sir, is not mistaken, I must avow to your Majesty, I have no Attachments but to my own Country." To this King George responded, "An honest Man will never have any other."<ref>{{cite web |url=https://founders.archives.gov/documents/Adams/06-17-02-0078#ADMS-06-17-02-0078-fn-0013 |title=From John Adams to John Jay, 2 June 1785 |publisher=Adams Papers, Massachusetts Historical Society |access-date=September 18, 2017}}</ref>

Adams was joined by Abigail while in London. Suffering the hostility of the King's courtiers, they escaped when they could by seeking out [[Richard Price]], minister of [[Newington Green Unitarian Church]] and instigator of the [[Revolution Controversy|debate over the Revolution]] within Britain.{{sfn|McCullough|2001|pp=343–344}} Adams corresponded with his sons John Quincy and Charles, both of whom were at Harvard, cautioning the former against the "smell of the midnight lamp" while admonishing the latter to devote sufficient time to study.{{sfn|McCullough|2001|pp=364–365}} Jefferson visited Adams in 1786 while serving as Minister to France; the two toured the countryside and saw many British historical sites.{{sfn|McCullough|2001|pp=354–357}} While in London, he briefly met his old friend Jonathan Sewall, but the two discovered that they had grown too far apart to renew their friendship. Adams considered Sewall one of the war's casualties, and Sewall critiqued him as an ambassador:

{{quote|His abilities are undoubtedly equal to the mechanical parts of his business as ambassador; but this is not enough. He cannot dance, drink, game, flatter, promise, dress, swear with the gentlemen, and small talk and flirt with the ladies; in short, he has none of those essential arts or ornaments which constitute a courtier. There are thousands who, with a tenth of his understanding and without a spark of his honesty, would distance him infinitely in any court in Europe.{{sfn|McCullough|2001|pp=348–350}}}}

Adams' tenure in Britain was complicated by both countries failing to follow their treaty obligations. The American states had been delinquent in paying debts owed to British merchants, and in response, the British refused to vacate forts in the northwest as promised. Adams' attempts to resolve this dispute failed, and he was often frustrated by a lack of news of progress from home.{{sfn|Smith|1962b|p=655}} The news he received of tumult at home, such as [[Shays' Rebellion]], heightened his anxiety. He then asked Jay to be relieved;{{sfn|Smith|1962b|p=702}} in 1788, he took his leave of George III, who engaged Adams in polite and formal conversation, promising to uphold his end of the treaty once America did the same.{{sfn|Smith|1962b|p=729}} Adams then went to The Hague to take formal leave of his ambassadorship there and to secure refinancing from the Dutch, allowing the United States to meet obligations on earlier loans.{{sfn|McCullough|2001|p=382}}

==Vice Presidency, 1789–97==
===Election===
On June 17, Adams arrived back in Massachusetts to a triumphant welcome. He returned to farming life in the months after. The nation's first [[U.S. presidential election, 1789|presidential election]] was soon to take place. Because George Washington was widely expected to win the presidency, many felt that the vice presidency should go a northerner. Although he made no public comments on the matter, Adams was the primary contender.{{sfn|McCullough|2001|pp=389–392}} Each state's [[Electoral College (United States)|presidential electors]] gathered on February 4, 1789 to cast their two votes for the president. The person with the most votes would be President and the second would become Vice President.{{sfn|Ferling|2009|pp=270–274}} Adams received 34 [[United States Electoral College|electoral college]] votes in the election, second place behind George Washington, who garnered 69 votes. As a result, Washington became the nation's [[List of Presidents of the United States|first president]], and Adams became its first [[List of Vice Presidents of the United States|vice president]]. Adams finished well ahead of all others except Washington, but was still offended by Washington receiving more than twice as many votes.{{sfn|McCullough|2001|pp=393–394}} To Benjamin Rush, he wrote, "Is not my election to this office, in the dark and scurvy manner in which it was done, a curse rather than a blessing?" Unbeknownst to Adams, [[Alexander Hamilton]] convinced many electors to not vote for him, under the pretext of not embarrassing Washington, to be absolutely sure that Adams did not win.{{sfn|Chernow|2004|pp=272–273}}

Although his term was scheduled to start on March 4, 1789, Adams did not become Vice President of the United States, until April 21, because Congress could not initially achieve a [[quorum]].<ref>{{cite web| title=Vice Presidential Inaugurations| url=https://www.aoc.gov/nations-stage/vice-president-inaugurations |publisher=Architect of the Capitol| location=Washington, D.C.| accessdate=July 15, 2017}}</ref>

===Tenure===

Although the House agreed that the president should be addressed simply as "George Washington, President of the United States", the Senate debated the issue at some length. Adams favored the adoption of the style of ''Highness'' (as well as the title of ''Protector of Their [the United States'] Liberties'') for the president.{{sfn|Hutson|1968|pp=30–39}} Some senators favored a variant of ''Highness'' or the lesser ''Excellency''."{{sfn|McCullough|2001|pp=404–405}} [[Anti-Federalism|Anti-federalists]] in the Senate objected to the monarchical sound of them all; Jefferson described them as "superlatively ridiculous."{{sfn|McCullough|2001|p=410}} The Senate emphasized simplicity and republicanism, and many argued that these "distinctions," as Adams called them, violated the Constitution's prohibition on titles of nobility. Adams argued that the distinctions were necessary because the highest office of the United States must be marked with "dignity and splendor" to command respect. He was widely derided for his combative nature and stubbornness, especially as he actively debated and lectured the senators. "For forty minutes he harangued us from the chair," wrote Senator [[William Maclay (Pennsylvania senator)|William Maclay]] of Pennsylvania. Maclay became Adams' fiercest opponent and repeatedly expressed personal contempt for him in both public and private. He likened Adams to "a monkey just put into breeches."{{sfn|McCullough|2001|pp=406–408}} [[Ralph Izard]] suggested that Adams be referred to by the title "His Rotundity," a joke which soon became popular.{{sfn|McCullough|2001|p=408}} On May 14, the Senate decided that the title of "[[Mr. President (title)|Mr. President]]" would be used.{{sfn|Wood|2006|p=54}} Privately, Adams conceded that his vice presidency had begun poorly, and that perhaps he had been out of the country too long to know the sentiment of the people. Washington quietly expressed his displeasure with the fuss and rarely consulted Adams.{{sfn|McCullough|2001|pp=408–409}}

[[File:George_Washington_1795.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Portrait of Washington by [[Gilbert Stuart]], 1795. Washington rarely consulted Vice President Adams, who often felt marginalized and overshadowed by his prestige.]]
As Vice President, Adams largely sided with the Washington administration and the emerging [[Federalist Party]]. He supported Washington's policies against opposition from anti-Federalists and [[Democratic-Republican Party|Republicans]]. He cast 31 [[List of tie-breaking votes cast by vice presidents of the United States|tie-breaking votes]], all in support of the administration, and more than any other vice president.{{sfn|McCullough|2001|p=460}} In 1790, Jefferson, Madison, and Hamilton struck a [[Compromise of 1790|bargain]] guaranteeing Republican support for Hamilton's [[Funding Act of 1790|debt assumption plan]] in exchange for the capital being temporarily moved from New York to [[Philadelphia]], and then to a permanent site on the [[Potomac River]] to placate Southerners. In the Senate, Adams cast a tie-breaking nay vote against a last-minute motion to keep the capital in New York.{{sfn|McCullough|2001|pp=425–426}} In another instance, he voted against a bill sponsored by Maclay that would have required Senate consent for the removal of executive branch officials who had been confirmed by the Senate.{{sfn|McCullough|2001|pp=413–414}}

Adams played a minor role in politics as Vice President. He attended few cabinet meetings, and the President sought his counsel infrequently.<ref name=USSadamsdoc/> While Adams brought energy and dedication to the office,{{sfn|Smith|1962b|p=769}} by mid-1789 he had already found it "not quite adapted to my character ... too inactive, and mechanical."<ref>{{cite web |url=https://founders.archives.gov/?q=%22not%20quite%20adapted%20to%20my%20character%22&s=1511311111&sa=&r=1&sr= |title=John Adams to John Quincy Adams, 9 July 1789 |publisher=Adams Papers, Massachusetts Historical Society |access-date=September 29, 2017}}</ref> He wrote, "My country has in its wisdom contrived for me the most insignificant office that ever the invention of man ... or his imagination contrived or his imagination conceived."{{sfn|Smith|1962b|p=844}} Adams' behavior made him a target for critics of the Washington administration. Toward the end of his first term, he grew accustomed to assuming a marginal role, and rarely intervened in debate.{{sfn|McCullough|2001|p=434}} Adams never questioned Washington's courage or patriotism, but Washington did join Franklin and others as the object of Adams' ire or envy. "The History of our Revolution will be one continued lie," Adams declared. "...&nbsp;The essence of the whole will be that Dr. Franklin's electrical Rod smote the Earth and out sprung General Washington. That Franklin electrified him with his Rod – and henceforth these two conducted all the Policy, Negotiations, Legislatures and War."{{sfn|Ferling|1992|p=310}} Adams won reelection with little difficulty in [[United States presidential election, 1792|1792]] with 77 votes. His strongest challenger, [[George Clinton (vice president)|George Clinton]], had 50.{{sfn|McCullough|2001|p=439}}

On July 14, 1789, the [[French Revolution]] began. Republicans were jubilant. Adams at first expressed cautious optimism, but soon began denouncing the revolutionaries as barbarous and tyrannical.{{sfn|McCullough|2001|pp=416–417}} Washington eventually consulted Adams more often, but not until near the end of his administration, by which point Hamilton, Jefferson, and [[Edmund Randolph]] had all resigned.{{sfn|Smith|1962b|p=878}} The British had been raiding American trading vessels, and John Jay was sent to London to negotiate an end to hostilities. When he returned with a [[Jay Treaty|peace treaty]] on terms unfavorable to the United States, Adams urged Washington to sign it to prevent war. Washington chose to do so, igniting protests and riots. He was accused of surrendering American honor to a tyrannical monarchy and of turning his back on the French Republic.{{sfn|McCullough|2001|pp=456–457}} John Adams predicted in a letter to Abigail that ratification would deeply divide the nation.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://founders.archives.gov/documents/Adams/04-11-02-0132 |title=John Adams to Abigail Adams, 16 April 1796 |publisher=Adams Papers, Massachusetts Historical Society |access-date=July 5, 2018}}</ref>

===Election of 1796===

Like the previous two presidential elections, no candidates were put forward for voters to choose between in 1796. The Constitution provided for the selection of electors who would then choose a president.{{sfn|Smith|1962b|pp=898–99}} In seven states voters chose the presidential electors. In the remaining nine states, they were chosen by the state's legislature.<ref name=JAelections>{{cite web |url=https://millercenter.org/president/adams/campaigns-and-elections |title=John Adams: Campaigns and Elections |last=Taylor |first=C.

The practice of not campaigning for office would remain for many decades.<ref name=JAelections/> Adams stated that he wanted to stay out of what he called the "silly and wicked game" of electioneering.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://founders.archives.gov/?q=silly%20and%20wicked%20game%20Author%3A%22Adams%2C%20John%22&s=1511311111&sa=&r=1&sr= |title=John Adams to Abigail Adams, 10 February 1796 |publisher=Adams Papers, Massachusetts Historical Society |access-date=November 13, 2017}}</ref>

As the campaign progressed, fears grew among Hamilton and his supporters that Adams was too vain, opinionated, unpredictable and stubborn to follow their directions.{{sfn|Elkins|McKitrick|1993|pp=513–537}} Indeed, Adams felt largely left out of Washington's administration and did not consider himself a strong member of the Federalist Party. He had remarked that Hamilton's economic program, centered around banks, would "swindle" the poor and unleash the "gangrene of avarice."{{sfn|Chernow|2004|p=521}} Desiring "a more pliant president than Adams," Hamilton maneuvered to tip the election to Pinckney. He coerced South Carolina Federalist electors, pledged to vote for "[[favorite son]]" Pinckney, to scatter their second votes among candidates other than Adams. Hamilton's scheme was undone when several [[New England]] state electors heard of it and agreed not to vote for Pinckney.{{sfn|Smith|1962b|p=902}} Adams wrote shortly after the election that Hamilton was a "proud Spirited, conceited, aspiring Mortal always pretending to Morality, with as debauched Morals as old Franklin who is more his Model than any one I know."<ref>{{cite web |url=https://founders.archives.gov/documents/Adams/04-11-02-0251 |title=John Adams to Abigail Adams, 9 January 1797 |publisher=Adams Papers, Massachusetts Historical Society |access-date=September 26, 2017}}</ref> Throughout his life, Adams made highly critical statements about Hamilton. He made derogatory references to his womanizing, real or alleged, and slurred him as the "[[Creole peoples|Creole]] bastard."{{sfn|Chernow|2004|p=522}}

In the end, Adams won the presidency by a narrow margin, receiving 71 electoral votes to 68 for Jefferson, who became the vice president; Pinckney finished in third with 59 votes, and Burr came in fourth with 30. The balance of the Electoral College votes were dispersed among nine other candidates.<ref name=ECscore>{{cite web| url=https://www.archives.gov/federal-register/electoral-college/scores.html#1789| title=Electoral College Box Scores 1789–1996| publisher=[[Office of the Federal Register]], [[National Archives and Records Administration]]| location=College Park, Maryland| accessdate=August 20, 2017}}</ref> This is the only election to date in which a president and vice president were elected from opposing tickets.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.latimes.com/opinion/la-oe-amar22-2008oct22-story.html |title=Vice president: a split-ticket vote? |last=Amar |first=Vikram David |date=October 22, 2008 |publisher=''The New York Times'' |access-date=October 17, 2017}}</ref>

{{Main|Presidency of John Adams}}
[[File:PhiladelphiaPresidentsHouse.jpg|thumb|[[President's House (Philadelphia)|President's House]], [[Philadelphia]]. Adams occupied this Philadelphia mansion from March 1797 to May 1800.]]

===Inauguration===
Adams was [[Inauguration of John Adams|sworn into office]] as the nation's second president on March 4, 1797 by [[Chief Justice of the United States|Chief Justice]] [[Oliver Ellsworth]]. As President, he followed Washington's lead in using the presidency to exemplify republican values and [[civic virtue]], and his service was free of scandal.<ref>{{cite web|title=The 3rd Presidential Inauguration, John Adams, March 04, 1797| url=https://www.inaugural.senate.gov/about/past-inaugural-ceremonies/3rd-inaugural-ceremonies/| publisher=U.S. Senate| location=Washington, D.C.| accessdate=August 23, 2017}}</ref> Adams spent much of his term at his Massachusetts home [[Peacefield]], preferring the quietness of domestic life to business at the capital. He ignored the political patronage and office seekers which other office holders utilized.{{sfn|Herring|2008|p=91}}

Historians debate his decision to retain the members of Washington's cabinet in light of the cabinet's loyalty to Hamilton. The "Hamiltonians who surround him," Jefferson soon remarked, "are only a little less hostile to him than to me."{{sfn|Ferling|1992|p=333}} Although aware of Hamilton's influence, Adams was convinced that their retention ensured a smoother succession.{{sfn|McCullough|2001|p=471}} Adams maintained the economic programs of Hamilton, who regularly consulted with key cabinet members, especially the powerful Treasury Secretary, [[Oliver Wolcott Jr.]]{{sfn|Kurtz|1957|p=272}} Adams was in other respects quite independent of his cabinet, often making decisions despite opposition from it.{{sfn|Chernow|2004|pp=593–594}} Hamilton had grown accustomed to being regularly consulted by Washington. Shortly after Adams was inaugurated, Hamilton sent him a detailed letter filled with policy suggestions for the new administration. Adams dismissively ignored it.{{sfn|Chernow|2004|p=524}}

===Failed peace commission and XYZ affair===
{{Main|XYZ Affair}}
[[File:Property protected à la françoise.jpg|thumb|right|A political cartoon depicts the XYZ Affair – America is a female being plundered by Frenchmen. (1798)]]
Historian [[Joseph Ellis]] writes that "[t]he Adams presidency was destined to be dominated by a single question of American policy to an extent seldom if ever encountered by any succeeding occupant of the office." That question was whether to make war with France or find peace.{{sfn|Ellis|1993|p=28}} In Europe, [[French Revolutionary Wars|Britain and France were at war]] as a result of the French Revolution. Hamilton and the Federalists favored the British monarchy against what they perceived to be the political and anti-religious radicalism of the French Revolution, while Jefferson and the Republicans, with their firm opposition to monarchy, strongly supported France.{{sfn|Wood|2009|pp=174–177; 240}} The French had supported Jefferson for president and became even more belligerent at his loss.{{sfn|Herring|2008|p=82}} When Adams entered office, he decided to continue Washington's policy of staying out of the war. Because of the Jay Treaty, the French saw America as Britain's junior partner and began seizing American merchant ships that were trading with the British. Most Americans were still pro-French due to France's assistance during the Revolution, the perceived humiliation of the Jay Treaty, and their desire to support a republic against the British monarchy, and would not tolerate war with France.{{sfn|Ferling|1992|pp=343–345}}

On May 16, 1797, Adams gave a speech to the House and Senate in which he called for increasing defense capabilities in case of war with France.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://avalon.law.yale.edu/18th_century/ja97-03.asp |title=John Adams – Special Message to the Senate and the House; May 16 1797 |publisher=''Avalon Project,'' Yale Law School |access-date=September 22, 2017}}</ref> He announced that he would send a peace commission to France but simultaneously called for a military buildup to counter any potential French threat. The speech was well received by the Federalists. Adams was depicted as an eagle holding an olive branch in one talon and the "emblems of defense" in the other. The Republicans were outraged, for Adams had not only failed to express support for the cause of the French Republic but appeared to be calling for war against it.{{sfn|McCullough|2001|pp=484–485}}

Sentiments changed with the [[XYZ Affair]]. The peace commission that Adams appointed consisted of [[John Marshall]], [[Charles Cotesworth Pinckney]] and [[Elbridge Gerry]].{{sfn|McCullough|2001|p=495}} Jefferson met four times with Joseph Letombe, the French consul in Philadelphia. Letombe wrote to Paris stating that Jefferson had told him that it was in France's best interest to treat the American ministers civilly but "then drag out the negotiations at length" to arrive at most favorable solution. According to Letombe, Jefferson called Adams "vain, suspicious, and stubborn."{{sfn|Chernow|2004|p=547}} When the envoys arrived in October, they were kept waiting for several days, and then granted only a 15-minute meeting with French Foreign Minister [[Charles Maurice de Talleyrand-Périgord|Talleyrand]]. The diplomats were then met by three of Talleyrand's agents. The French emissaries (later code-named, X, Y, and Z) refused to conduct negotiations unless the United States paid enormous bribes, one to Talleyrand personally, and another to the Republic of France.{{sfn|McCullough|2001|p=495}} Supposedly this was to make up for offenses given to France by Adams in his speech.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://founders.archives.gov/?q=talleyrand%20Author%3A%22Adams%2C%20John%22&s=1511311111&r=4 |title=Epitomy, and Remarks on Actions of Ministers at Paris, 22 October 1797 |publisher=Adams Papers, Massachusetts Historical Society |access-date=August 29, 2017}}</ref> The Americans refused to negotiate on such terms.{{sfn|McCullough|2001|pp=495–496}} Marshall and Pinckney returned home, while Gerry remained.{{sfn|McCullough|2001|p=502}}

News of the disastrous peace mission arrived in the form of a memorandum from Marshall on March 4, 1798. Adams, not wanting to incite violent impulses among the populace, announced that the mission had failed without providing details.{{sfn|Chernow|2004|p=550}} He also sent a message to Congress asking for a renewal of the nation's defenses. The Republicans frustrated the President's defense measures. Suspecting that he might be hiding material favorable to France, the House, with the support of Federalists who had heard rumors of what was contained in the messages and were happy to assist the Republicans, voted overwhelmingly to demand that Adams release the papers. Once they were released, the Republicans, according to Abigail, were "struck dumb."{{sfn|Smith|1962b|pp=957–960}} [[Benjamin Franklin Bache]], editor of the ''[[Philadelphia Aurora]],'' blamed Adams' aggression as the cause of the disaster. Among the general public, the effects were very different. The affair substantially weakened popular American support of France. Adams reached the height of his popularity as many in the country called for full-scale war against the French.{{sfn|McCullough|2001|p=498}}

===Alien and Sedition Acts===
{{Main|Alien and Sedition Acts}}
Despite the XYZ Affair, Republican opposition persisted. Federalists accused the French and their associated immigrants of provoking civil unrest. In an attempt to quell the outcry, the Federalists introduced, and the Congress passed, a series of laws collectively referred to as the [[Alien and Sedition Acts]], which were signed by Adams in June 1798.{{sfn|Ferling|1992|pp=365–368}} Congress specifically passed four measures – the [[Naturalization Act of 1798|Naturalization Act]], the Alien Friends Act, the Alien Enemies Act and the Sedition Act. All came within a period of two weeks, in what Jefferson called an "unguarded passion." The Alien Friends Act, Alien Enemies Act, and Naturalization Acts targeted immigrants, specifically French, by giving the president greater deportation authority and increasing citizenship requirements. The Sedition Act made it a crime to publish "false, scandalous, and malicious writing" against the government or its officials.{{sfn|Ferling|1992|p=365}} Adams had not promoted any of these acts, but was urged to sign them by his wife and cabinet. He eventually agreed and signed the bills into law.{{sfn|Ferling|1992|p=366}}

[[File:Thomas Jefferson rev.jpg|thumb|right|Thomas Jefferson, Adams' vice president, attempted to undermine many of his actions as President and eventually defeated him for reelection.]]
The administration initiated fourteen or more indictments under the Sedition Act, as well as suits against five of the six most prominent Republican newspapers. The majority of the legal actions began in 1798 and 1799, and went to trial on the eve of the 1800 presidential election. Other historians have cited evidence that the Alien and Sedition Acts were rarely enforced, namely: 1) only 10 convictions under the Sedition Act have been identified; 2) Adams never signed a deportation order; and 3) the sources of expressed furor over the acts were Republicans. The Acts allowed for prosecution of many who opposed the Federalists.{{sfn|Chernow|2004|p=668}} Congressman [[Matthew Lyon]] of Vermont was sentenced to four months in jail for criticizing the President.{{sfn|Chernow|2004|p=575}} Adams resisted Pickering's attempts to deport aliens, although many left on their own, largely in response to the hostile environment.{{sfn|Ferling|1992|p=367}} Republicans were outraged. Jefferson, disgusted by the acts, wrote nothing publicly but partnered with Madison to secretly draft the [[Kentucky and Virginia Resolutions]]. Jefferson, writing for Kentucky, wrote that states had the "natural right" to [[Nullification (U.S. Constitution)|nullify]] any acts they deemed unconstitutional. Writing to Madison, he speculated that as a last resort the states might have to "sever ourselves from the union we so much value."{{sfn|McCullough|2001|pp=520–521}} Federalists reacted bitterly to the resolutions, which were to have far more lasting implications for the country than the Alien and Sedition Acts. Still, the acts Adams signed into law energized and unified the Republican Party while doing little to unite the Federalists.{{sfn|Chernow|2004|pp=573–575}}

===Quasi-War===
In May 1798, a French privateer captured a merchant vessel off of the New York Harbor. An increase in attacks on sea marked the beginning of the undeclared naval war known as the [[Quasi-War]].{{sfn|Chernow|2004|p=553}} Adams knew that America would be unable to win a major conflict, both because of its internal divisions and because France at the time was dominating the fight in most of Europe. He pursued a strategy whereby America harassed French ships in an effort sufficient to stem the French assaults on American interests.{{sfn|Ferling|1992|pp=356–357}} In May, shortly after the attack in New York, Congress created a separate Navy Department. The prospect of a French invasion of the U.S. mainland led for calls to build up the army. Hamilton and other "High Federalists" were particularly adamant that a large army be called up, in spite of a common fear, particularly among Republicans, that large standing armies were subversive to liberty. In May, a "provisional" army of 10,000 soldiers was authorized by Congress. In July, Congress created twelve infantry regiments and provided for six cavalry companies. These numbers exceeded Adams' requests but fell short of Hamilton's.{{sfn|Chernow|2004|pp=552–553}}

Adams was pressured by Federalists to appoint Hamilton, who had served as Washington's aide-de-camp during the Revolution, to command the army.{{sfn|Flexner|1974|p=376}} Distrustful of Hamilton and fearing a plot to subvert his administration, Adams appointed Washington to command the army without consulting him. Washington was surprised, and as a condition of his acceptance demanded that he be permitted to appoint his own subordinates. He wished to have [[Henry Knox]] as second-in-command, followed by Hamilton, and then Charles Pinckney.{{sfn|Flexner|1974|pp=376–377}} On June 2, Hamilton wrote to Washington stating that he would not serve unless he was made Inspector General and second-in-command.{{sfn|Chernow|2004|p=555}} Washington conceded that Hamilton, despite holding a rank lower than that of Knox and Pinckney, had, by serving on his staff, more opportunity to comprehend the whole military scene, and should therefore outrank them. Adams sent Secretary of War McHenry to [[Mount Vernon]] to convince Washington to accept the post. McHenry put forth his opinion that Washington would not serve unless permitted to choose his own officers.{{sfn|Flexner|1974|p=378}} Adams had intended to appoint Republicans Burr and [[Frederick Muhlenberg]] to make the army appear bipartisan. Washington's list consisted entirely of Federalists.{{sfn|Smith|1962b|p=978}} Adams relented and agreed to submit to the Senate the names of Hamilton, Pinckney, and Knox, in that order, although final decisions of rank would be reserved to Adams.{{sfn|Flexner|1974|p=378}} Knox refused to serve under these conditions. Adams firmly intended to give to Hamilton the lowest possible rank, while Washington and many other Federalists wrongly insisted that the order in which the names had been submitted to the Senate must determine seniority. On September 21, Adams received a letter from McHenry relaying a statement from Washington threatening to resign if Hamilton were not made second-in-command.{{sfn|Flexner|1974|pp=380–381}} Adams knew of the backlash that he would receive from Federalists should he continue his course, and he was forced to capitulate despite bitter resentment against many of his fellow Federalists.{{sfn|Smith|1962b|pp=982–983}} The severe illness of Abigail, whom Adams was feared was near death, exacerbated his suffering and frustration.{{sfn|Flexner|1974|pp=380–381}}

[[File:Alexander Hamilton portrait by John Trumbull 1806.jpg|thumb|left|Alexander Hamilton's desire for high military rank and his push for war with France put him into conflict with Adams.]]
It quickly became apparent that due to Washington's advanced age, Hamilton was the army's ''de facto'' commander. He exerted effective control over the War Department, taking over supplies for the army.{{sfn|Kurtz|1957|p=331}} Meanwhile, Adams built up the Navy, adding [[six original United States frigates|six fast, powerful frigates]], most notably the [[USS Constitution|USS ''Constitution'']].{{sfn|McCullough|2001|p=507}}

The Quasi-War continued, but there was a noticeable decline in war fever beginning in the fall once news arrived of the French defeat at the [[Battle of the Nile]], which many Americans hoped would make them more disposed to negotiate.{{sfn|McCullough|2001|pp=516–517}} In October, Adams heard from Gerry in Paris that the French wanted to make peace and would properly receive an American delegation. That December in his address to Congress, Adams relayed these statements while expressing the need to maintain adequate defenses. The speech angered both Federalists, including Hamilton, many of whom had wanted a request for a declaration of war, and Republicans.{{sfn|Chernow|2004|pp=592–593}} Hamilton secretly promoted a plan, already rejected by Adams, in which American and British troops would combine to seize [[Spanish Florida]] and [[Louisiana (New Spain)|Louisiana]], ostensibly to deter a possible French invasion. Hamilton's critics, including Abigail, saw in his military buildups the signs of an aspiring military dictator.{{sfn|McCullough|2001|p=518}}

On February 18, 1799, Adams surprised many by nominating diplomat [[William Vans Murray]] on a peace mission to France. The decision was made without consulting his cabinet or even Abigail, who nonetheless upon hearing of it described it as a "master stroke." To placate Republicans, he nominated [[Patrick Henry]] and Ellsworth to accompany Murray and the Senate immediately approved them on March 3. Henry declined the nomination and Adams chose [[William Richardson Davie]] to replace him.{{sfn|McCullough|2001|pp=523–525}} Hamilton strongly criticized the decision, as did Adams' cabinet members, who maintained frequent communication with him. Adams again questioned the loyalty of those men but did not remove them.{{sfn|Chernow|2004|pp=593–594}} To the annoyance of many, Adams spent a full seven months–March to September–of 1799 in Peacefield, finally returning to Trenton, where the government had set up temporary quarters due to the [[yellow fever]] epidemic, after a letter arrived from Talleyrand confirming Gerry's statement that American ministers would be received. Adams then decided to send the commissioners to France.{{sfn|McCullough|2001|pp=526–529}} Adams arrived back in Trenton on October 10.{{sfn|Morse|1884|p=304}} Shortly after, Hamilton, in a breach of military protocol, arrived uninvited at the city to speak with the President, urging him not to send the peace commissioners but instead to ally with Britain, which he viewed to be the stronger party, to restore the [[House of Bourbon|Bourbons]] to France. "I heard him with perfect good humor, though never in my life did I hear a man talk more like a fool," Adams said. He regarded Hamilton's idea as chimerical and far-fetched. On November 15, the commissioners set sail for Paris.{{sfn|McCullough|2001|pp=530–531}}

To pay for the military buildup of the Quasi-War, Adams and his Federalist allies enacted the [[direct tax|Direct Tax]] of 1798. Direct taxation by the federal government was widely unpopular, and the government's revenue under Washington had mostly come from [[excise tax]]es and [[Tariffs in United States history|tariffs]]. Though Washington had maintained a balanced budget with the help of a growing economy, increased military expenditures threatened to cause major budget deficits, and the Federalists developed a taxation plan to meet the need for increased government revenue. The Direct Tax of 1798 instituted a [[progressive tax|progressive]] [[land value tax]] of up to 1% of the value of a property. Taxpayers in eastern Pennsylvania resisted federal tax collectors, and in March 1799 the bloodless Fries's Rebellion broke out. Led by Revolutionary War veteran [[John Fries]], rural German-speaking farmers protested what they saw as a threat to their liberties. They intimidated tax collectors, who often found themselves unable to go about their business.{{sfn|Elkins|McKitrick|1993|pp=696–700}} The disturbance was quickly ended with Hamilton leading the army to restore peace.{{sfn|Diggins|2003|pp=129–130}}

Fries and two other leaders were arrested, found guilty of treason, and sentenced to hang. They appealed to Adams requesting a pardon. The cabinet unanimously advised Adams to refuse, but he instead granted the pardon, using as justification the argument that the men had instigated a mere riot as opposed to a rebellion.{{sfn|McCullough|2001|pp=540–541}} In his pamphlet attacking Adams before the election, Hamilton wrote that "it was impossible to commit a greater error."<ref name="Adams Pamphlet">{{cite web |url=https://founders.archives.gov/documents/Hamilton/01-25-02-0110-0002#ARHN-01-25-02-0110-0002-fn-0166-ptr |title=Letter from Alexander Hamilton, Concerning the Public Conduct and Character of John Adams, Esq.

On May 5, 1800, Adams' frustrations with the Hamilton wing of the party exploded during a meeting with McHenry, a Hamilton loyalist who was universally regarded, even by Hamilton, as an inept Secretary of War. Adams accused him of subservience to Hamilton and declared that he would rather serve as Jefferson's vice president or minister at The Hague than be beholden to Hamilton for the presidency. McHenry offered to resign at once, and Adams accepted. On May 10, he asked Pickering to resign. Pickering refused and was summarily dismissed. Adams named John Marshall as Secretary of State and [[Samuel Dexter]] as Secretary of War.{{sfn|McCullough|2001|pp=538–539}}{{sfn|Smith|1962b|pp=1028–1029}} In 1799, [[Napoleon]] took over as head of the French government in the [[Coup of 18 Brumaire]] and declared the French Revolution over.{{sfn|McCullough|2001|p=534}} News of this event increased Adams' desire to disband the provisional army, which, with Washington now dead, was commanded only by Hamilton.{{sfn|McCullough|2001|pp=539–540}} His moves to end the army after the departures of McHenry and Pickering were met with little opposition.{{sfn|Ferling|1992|p=395}} Rather than allow Adams to receive the credit, Federalists joined with Republicans in voting to disband the army in mid-1800.{{sfn|McCullough|2001|pp=539–540}}

Napoleon, realizing that the conflict was pointless, signaled his readiness for friendly relations. By the [[Convention of 1800]], the two sides agreed to return any captured ships and to allow for the peaceful transfer of non-military goods to an enemy of the nation. On January 23, 1801, the Senate voted 16–14 in favor of the treaty, four votes short of the necessary two thirds. Some Federalists, including Hamilton, urged that the Senate vote in favor of the treaty with reservations. A new proposal was then drawn up demanding that the [[Treaty of Alliance (1778)|Treaty of Alliance of 1778]] be superseded and that France pay for its damages to American property. On February 3, the treaty with the reservations passed 22–9 and was signed by Adams.{{sfn|McCullough|2001|p=150}}{{efn|Jefferson, after entering office, approved a negotiated end to the 1778 alliance, freeing the United States of foreign entanglements, while excusing France from paying indemnities.{{sfn|Ferling|1992|p=423}}}} Adams proudly avoided war, but deeply split his party in the process. Historian [[Ron Chernow]] writes that "the threat of Jacobinism" was the one thing that united the Federalist Party, and that Adams' elimination of it unwittingly contributed to the party's demise.{{sfn|Chernow|2004|p=594}} News of the peace treaty did not arrive in the United States until after the election, too late to sway the results.{{sfn|Chernow|2004|p=631}}

===Establishing government institutions and move to Washington===
Adams' leadership on naval defense has sometimes led him to be called the "father of the [[American Navy]]."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.history.navy.mil/research/histories/ship-histories/danfs/j/john-adams-frigate-i.html|title=John Adams I (Frigate) 1799–1867|publisher=''Naval History and Heritage Command'' |access-date=August 22, 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150909083339/http://www.history.navy.mil/research/histories/ship-histories/danfs/j/john-adams-frigate-i.html|archivedate=September 9, 2015|df=mdy-all}}</ref>{{sfn|Miller|1997|p=9}} In July 1798, he signed into law [[An Act for the relief of sick and disabled seamen]], which authorized the establishment of a government-operated marine hospital service.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/rickungar/2011/01/17/congress-passes-socialized-medicine-and-mandates-health-insurance-in-1798/|title=Congress Passes Socialized Medicine and Mandates Health Insurance – In 1798|accessdate=August 23, 2015|publisher=''Forbes''|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150812024426/http://www.forbes.com/sites/rickungar/2011/01/17/congress-passes-socialized-medicine-and-mandates-health-insurance-in-1798/|archivedate=August 12, 2015|df=mdy-all}}</ref> In 1800, he signed the law establishing the [[Library of Congress]].<ref name="OLC"/>

Adams made his first official visit to the nation's new [[seat of government]] in early June 1800. Amid the "raw and unfinished" cityscape, the President found the public buildings "in a much greater forwardness of completion than expected."{{sfn|Smith|1962b|p=1036}} He moved into the nearly completed [[White House|President's Mansion]] (later known as the White House) on November 1.

===Election of 1800===
{{Main|United States presidential election, 1800}}
[[File:ElectoralCollege1800.svg|thumb|250px|1800 presidential election results]]
With the Federalist Party deeply split over his negotiations with France, and the opposition Republican Party enraged over the Alien and Sedition Acts and the expansion of the military, Adams faced a daunting reelection campaign in [[United States presidential election, 1800|1800]].<ref name=JAelections/> The Federalist congressmen caucused in the spring of 1800 and nominated Adams and [[Charles Cotesworth Pinckney]]. The Republicans nominated Jefferson and Burr, their candidates in the previous election.<ref name="Ferling, ch. 19">Ferling, ch. 19.</ref>

The campaign was bitter and characterized by malicious insults by partisan presses on both sides. Federalists claimed that the Republicans were the enemies of "all who love order, peace, virtue, and religion." They were said to be libertines and dangerous radicals who favored states' rights over the Union and would instigate anarchy and civil war. Jefferson's rumored [[Sally Hemmings|affairs]] with slaves were used against him. Republicans in turn accused Federalists of subverting republican principles through punitive federal laws and of favoring Britain and the other coalition countries in their war with France to promote aristocratic, anti-republican values. Jefferson was portrayed as an apostle of liberty and man of the people, while Adams was labelled a monarchist. He was accused of insanity and marital infidelity.{{sfn|McCullough|2001|pp=543–545}} [[James T. Callender]], a Republican propagandist secretly financed by Jefferson, degraded Adams' character and accused him of attempting to make war with France. Callender was arrested and jailed under the Sedition Act, which only further inflamed Republican passions.{{sfn|McCullough|2001|pp=536–537}}

Opposition from the Federalist Party was at times equally intense. Some, including Pickering, accused Adams of colluding with Jefferson so that he would end up either president or vice president.{{sfn|McCullough|2001|p=544}} Hamilton was hard at work, attempting to sabotage the President's reelection. Planning an indictment of Adams' character, he requested and received private documents from both the ousted cabinet secretaries and Wolcott.{{sfn|Chernow|2004|pp=619–620}} The letter was intended for only a few Federalist electors. Upon seeing a draft, several Federalists urged Hamilton not to send it. Wolcott wrote that "the poor old man" could do himself in without Hamilton's assistance. Hamilton did not heed their advice.{{sfn|McCullough|2001|p=549}} On October 24, he sent a pamphlet strongly attacking Adams' policies and character. Hamilton denounced the "precipitate nomination" of Murray, the pardoning of Fries, and the firing of Pickering. He included a fair share of personal insults, vilifying the President's "disgusting egotism" and "ungovernable temper." Adams, he concluded, was "emotionally unstable, given to impulsive and irrational decisions, unable to coexist with his closest advisers, and generally unfit to be president."<ref name="Adams Pamphlet"/> Strangely, it ended by saying that the electors should support Adams and Pinckney equally.{{sfn|McCullough|2001|p=550}} Thanks to Burr, who had covertly obtained a copy, the pamphlet became public knowledge and was distributed throughout the country by Republicans, who rejoiced in what it contained.{{sfn|Morse|1884|pp=320–321}} The pamphlet destroyed the Federalist Party, ended Hamilton's political career, and helped ensure Adams' already-likely defeat.{{sfn|McCullough|2001|p=550}}

When the electoral votes were counted, Adams finished in third place with 65 votes, and Pinckney came in fourth with 64 votes. Jefferson and Burr tied for first place with 73 votes each. Because of the tie, the election devolved upon the House of Representatives, with each state having one vote and a supermajority required for victory. On February 17, 1801 – on the 36th ballot – Jefferson was elected by a vote of 10 to 4 (two states abstained).<ref name=JAelections/><ref name=ECscore/> It is noteworthy that Hamilton's scheme, although it made the Federalists appear divided and therefore helped Jefferson win, failed in its overall attempt to woo Federalist electors away from Adams.{{sfn|Chernow|2004|p=626}}{{efn|Ferling attributes Adams's defeat to five factors: the stronger organization of the Republicans; Federalist disunity; the controversy surrounding the Alien and Sedition Acts; the popularity of Jefferson in the South; and the effective politicking of Burr in [[New York (state)|New York]].{{sfn|Ferling|1992|pp=404–405}} Adams wrote, "No party that ever existed knew itself so little or so vainly overrated its own influence and popularity as ours. None ever understood so ill the causes of its own power, or so wantonly destroyed them."{{sfn|Smith|1962b|p=1053}} Stephen G. Kurtz argues that Hamilton and his supporters were primarily responsible for the destruction of the Federalist Party. They viewed the party as a personal tool and played into the hands of the Jeffersonians by building up a large standing army and creating a feud with Adams.{{sfn|Kurtz|1957|p=331}} Chernow writes that Hamilton believed that by eliminating Adams, he could eventually pick up the pieces of the ruined Federalist Party and lead it back to dominance: "Better to purge Adams and let Jefferson govern for a while than to water down the party's ideological purity with compromises."{{sfn|Chernow|2004|p=626}}}}

To compound the agony of his defeat, Adams' son Charles, a long-time alcoholic, died on November 30. Anxious to rejoin Abigail, who had already left for Massachusetts, Adams departed the White House in the predawn hours of March 4, 1801, and did not attend [[First inauguration of Thomas Jefferson|Jefferson's inauguration]]. Since him, only three out-going presidents (having served a full term) have not attended their successors' inaugurations.<ref name="Ferling, ch. 19"/> The complications arising out of the 1796 and 1800 elections prompted Congress and the states to refine the process whereby the Electoral College elects a president and a vice president through the [[Twelfth Amendment to the United States Constitution|12th Amendment]], which became a part of the Constitution in 1804.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://constitutioncenter.org/interactive-constitution/amendments/amendment-xii |title=Election of President and Vice President |last=Levinson |first=Sanford V. |publisher=''Constitution Center'' |access-date=September 26, 2017}}</ref>

Adams appointed two [[Supreme Court of the United States|U.S. Supreme Court]] associate justices during his term in office: [[Bushrod Washington]], the nephew of American founding father and President George Washington, and [[Alfred Moore]].<ref name="Ferling, ch. 19"/> After the retirement of Ellsworth due to ill health in 1800, it fell to Adams to appoint the Court's fourth Chief Justice. At the time, it was not yet certain whether Jefferson or Burr would win the election. Regardless, Adams believed that the choice should be someone "in the full vigor of middle age" who could counter what might be a long line of successive Republican presidents. Adams chose his Secretary of State John Marshall.{{sfn|Smith|1962b|pp=1063–1064}} He, along with Stoddert, was one of Adams' few trusted cabinet members, and was among the first to greet him when he arrived at the White House.{{sfn|McCullough|2001|p=550}} Adams signed his commission on January 31 and the Senate approved it immediately.{{sfn|McCullough|2001|p=560}} Marshall's long tenure left a lasting influence on the Court. He maintained a carefully reasoned nationalistic interpretation of the Constitution and established the judicial branch as the equal of the executive and legislative branches.{{sfn|Ferling|1992|p=411}}

After the Federalists lost control of both houses of Congress along with the White House in the election of 1800, the [[lame-duck session]] of the 6th Congress in February 1801 approved a judiciary act, commonly known as the [[Midnight Judges Act]], which created a set of federal appeals courts between the district courts and the Supreme Court. Adams filled the vacancies created in this statute by appointing a series of judges, whom his opponents called the "Midnight Judges," just days before his term expired. Most of these judges lost their posts when the [[7th United States Congress|7th Congress]], with a solid Republican majority, approved the [[Judiciary Act of 1802]], abolishing the newly created courts.{{sfn|Ferling|1992|pp=408–410}}

==Retirement==
===Initial years===
Adams resumed farming at Peacefield in the town of Quincy and began work on an autobiography. The work had numerous gaps and was eventually abandoned and left unedited.{{sfn|Ferling|1992|pp=421–423}} Most of Adams' attention was focused on farm work. His frugal lifestyle and presidential salary had left him with a considerable fortune by 1801. In 1803, the bank holding his cash reserves of about $13,000 collapsed. John Quincy resolved the crisis by buying his properties in Weymouth and Quincy, including Peacefield, for $12,800.{{sfn|Ferling|1992|p=435}} During the first four years of retirement, Adams made little effort to contact others, but eventually resumed contact with old acquaintances such as [[Benjamin Waterhouse]] and [[Benjamin Rush]].{{sfn|Ferling|1992|p=426}}

Adams generally stayed quiet on public matters. He did not publicly denounce Jefferson's actions as President,{{sfn|McCullough|2001|p=595}} believing that "instead of opposing Systematically any Administration, running down their Characters and opposing all their Measures right or wrong, We ought to Support every Administration as far as We can in Justice."<ref name="Adams 1808">{{cite web |url=https://founders.archives.gov/documents/Adams/99-02-02-5238 |title=From John Adams to Benjamin Rush, 18 April 1808 |publisher=Adams Papers, Massachusetts Historical Society |access-date=October 7, 2017}}</ref> When a disgruntled James Callender, angry at not being appointed to an office, turned on the President by revealing the [[Sally Hemings]] affair, Adams said nothing.{{sfn|McCullough|2001|pp=579–585}} John Quincy was elected to the Senate in 1803. Shortly thereafter, both he and his father crossed party lines to support Jefferson's [[Louisiana Purchase]].{{sfn|McCullough|2001|p=586}} The only major political incident involving Adams during the Jefferson years was a dispute with [[Mercy Otis Warren]] in 1806. Warren, an old friend, had attacked Adams in a pamphlet for his "partiality for monarchy" and "pride of talents and much ambition." A tempestuous correspondence ensued. In time, their friendship healed.{{sfn|McCullough|2001|pp=594–596}} Adams did privately criticize the President over his [[Embargo Act of 1807|Embargo Act]],<ref name="Adams 1808"/> despite the fact that John Quincy voted for it.{{sfn|McCullough|2001|pp=598–599}} John Quincy resigned from the Senate in 1808 after the Federalist-controlled State Senate refused to nominate him for a second term. After the Federalists denounced John Quincy as no longer being of their party, Adams wrote to him that he himself had long since "abdicated and disclaimed the name and character and attributes of that sect."{{sfn|McCullough|2001|p=599}}

After Jefferson's retirement from public life in 1809, Adams became more vocal. He published a three-year marathon of letters in the ''[[Boston Patriot (newspaper)|Boston Patriot]]'' newspaper, refuting line-by-line Hamilton's 1800 pamphlet. The initial piece was written shortly after his return from Peacefield and "had gathered dust for eight years." Adams had decided to shelve it over fears that it could negatively impact John Quincy should he ever seek office. Although Hamilton had died in 1804 in [[Burr–Hamilton duel|a duel with Aaron Burr]], Adams felt the need to vindicate his character against his charges. With his son having broken from the Federalist Party and joined the Republicans, he felt he could safely do so without threatening his political career.{{sfn|Ferling|1992|pp=429–430}} Adams supported the [[War of 1812]]. Having worried over the rise of sectionalism, he celebrated the growth of a "national character" that accompanied it.{{sfn|Ferling|1992|pp=425–426}}

Daughter [[Abigail Adams Smith|Abigail ("Nabby")]] was married to [[Congressman|Representative]] [[William Stephens Smith]], but she returned to her parents' home after the failure of the marriage; she died of [[breast cancer]] in 1813.{{sfn|Ferling|1992|p=430}}

===Correspondence with Jefferson===
In early 1801, Adams sent Thomas Jefferson a brief note after returning to Quincy wishing him a happy and prosperous presidency. Jefferson failed to respond, and they did not speak again for nearly 12 years. In 1804, Abigail, unbeknownst to her husband, wrote to Jefferson to express her condolences upon the death of his daughter [[Mary Jefferson Eppes|Polly]], who had stayed with the Adamses in London in 1787. This initiated a brief correspondence between the two which quickly descended into political rancor. Jefferson terminated it by not replying to Abigail's fourth letter. Aside from that, by 1812 there had been no communication between Peacefield and Monticello since Adams left office.{{sfn|Ferling|1992|p=431}}

[[File:Brooklyn Museum - Portrait of John Adams - Samuel Finley Breese Morse - overall.jpg|thumb|right|John Adams, c. 1816, by [[Samuel Morse]] ([[Brooklyn Museum of Art|Brooklyn Museum]])|alt=An unsmiling elderly man sits in a red chair, slightly pointing left.]]

In early 1812, Adams reconciled with Jefferson. The previous year had been tragic for Adams; his brother-in-law and friend Richard Cranch had died along with his widow Mary, and Nabby had been diagnosed with breast cancer. These events mellowed Adams and caused him to soften his outlook.{{sfn|Ferling|1992|pp=429–430}} Their mutual friend Benjamin Rush, a fellow signer of the [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]] who had been corresponding with both, encouraged them to reach out to each other. On New Year's Day, Adams sent a brief, friendly note to Jefferson to accompany the delivery of "two pieces of homespun," a two-volume collection of lectures on rhetoric by John Quincy Adams. Jefferson replied immediately with a cordial letter, and the two men revived their friendship, which they sustained by mail. The correspondence that they resumed in 1812 lasted the rest of their lives, and has been hailed as among their great legacies of American literature. Their letters represent an insight into both the period and the minds of the two revolutionary leaders and presidents. The missives lasted fourteen years, and consisted of 158 letters – 109 from Adams and 49 from Jefferson.{{sfn|Ferling|1992|pp=431–432}}

Early on, Adams repeatedly tried to turn the correspondence to a discussion of their actions in the political arena.{{sfn|McCullough|2001|p=607}} Jefferson refused to oblige him, saying that "nothing new can be added by you or me to what has been said by others and will be said in every age."<ref>Thomas Jefferson to John Adams, June 27, 1813. Cappon p. 338.</ref> Adams made one more attempt, writing that "You and I ought not to die before we have explained ourselves to each other."<ref>John Adams to Thomas Jefferson, July 15, 1813. Cappon p. 358.</ref> Still, Jefferson declined to engage Adams in this sort of discussion. Adams accepted this, and the correspondence turned to other matters, particularly philosophy and their daily habits.{{sfn|McCullough|2001|p=608}}{{efn|The two men discussed "natural aristocracy." Jefferson said, "The natural aristocracy I consider as the most precious gift of nature for the instruction, the trusts, and government of society. And indeed it would have been inconsistent in creation to have formed man for the social state, and not to have provided virtue and wisdom enough to manage the concerns of society. May we not even say that the form of government is best which provides most effectually for a pure selection of these natural [aristocrats] into the offices of government?"<ref>Thomas Jefferson to John Adams, October 28, 1813. Cappon, p. 388.</ref> Adams wondered if it ever would be so clear who these people were, "Your distinction between natural and artificial aristocracy does not appear to me well founded. Birth and wealth are conferred on some men as imperiously by nature, as genius, strength, or beauty. ... When aristocracies are established by human laws and honour, wealth, and power are made hereditary by municipal laws and political institutions, then I acknowledge artificial aristocracy to commence." It would always be true, Adams argued, that fate would bestow influence on some men for reasons other than wisdom and virtue. A good government had to account for that reality.<ref>John Adams to Thomas Jefferson, November 15, 1813. Cappon, p. 400.</ref>}}

As the two grew older, the letters became fewer and farther between. There was also important information that each man kept to himself. Jefferson said nothing about his construction of a new house, domestic turmoil, slave ownership, or poor financial situation, while Adams did not mention the troublesome behavior of his son Thomas, who had failed as a lawyer and become an alcoholic, resorting afterwards to living primarily as a caretaker at Peacefield.{{sfn|McCullough|2001|p=634}}

===Last years and death===
Abigail died of [[typhoid]] on October 28, 1818.{{sfn|Ferling|1992|p=437}} The year 1824 was filled with excitement in America, featuring a [[United States presidential election, 1824|four way presidential contest]] which included John Quincy. The [[Marquis de Lafayette]] toured the country and met briefly with Adams, who greatly enjoyed the visit.{{sfn|McCullough|2001|p=637}} Adams was delighted by the election of John Quincy to the presidency. The results became official in February 1825 after a deadlock was decided in the House of Representatives. He did remark, "No man who ever held the office of President would congratulate a friend on obtaining it."{{sfn|McCullough|2001|p=639}}

Less than a month before his death, Adams issued a statement about the destiny of the United States, which historian [[Joy Hakim]] characterized as a warning for his fellow citizens: "My best wishes, in the joys, and festivities, and the solemn services of that day on which will be completed the fiftieth year from its birth, of the independence of the United States: a memorable epoch in the annals of the human race, destined in future history to form the brightest or the blackest page, according to the use or the abuse of those political institutions by which they shall, in time to come, be shaped by the human mind."{{sfn|Hakim|2003|p=97}}

During the First Continental Congress, Adams was sometimes solicited for his views on government. While recognizing its importance, Adams had privately criticized [[Thomas Paine]]'s 1776 pamphlet ''[[Common Sense (pamphlet)|Common Sense]]'', which attacked all forms of monarchy, even constitutional monarchy of the sort advocated by [[John Locke]]. It supported a unicameral legislature and a weak executive elected by the legislature. According to Adams, the author had "a better hand at pulling down than building."{{sfn|McCullough|2001|p=97}} He believed that the views expressed in the pamphlet were "so democratical, without any restraint or even an attempt at any equilibrium or counter poise, that it must produce confusion and every evil work."{{sfn|Foot|Kramnick|1987|p=11}} What Paine advocated was a radical democracy with the views of the majority neither checked nor counterbalanced. This was incompatible with the system of checks and balances that conservatives like Adams would implement.{{sfn|Gimbel|1956|p=21}} Some delegates urged Adams to commit his views to paper. He did so in separate letters to these colleagues. So impressed was Richard Henry Lee that, with Adams' consent, he had the most comprehensive letter printed. Published anonymously in April 1776, it was titled ''[[Thoughts on Government]]'' and styled as "a Letter from a Gentleman to his Friend." Many historians agree that none of Adams' other compositions rivaled the enduring influence of this pamphlet.{{sfn|Ferling|1992|pp=155–157}}

Adams advised that the form of government should be chosen to attain the desired ends – the happiness and virtue of the greatest number of people. He wrote that, "There is no good government but what is [[Republicanism in the United States|republican]]. That the only valuable part of the [[Constitution of the United Kingdom|British constitution]] is so because the very definition of a republic is an empire of laws, and not of men." The treatise defended [[bicameralism]], for "a single assembly is liable to all the vices, follies and frailties of an individual."<ref>[[#Adams|Adams]], Vol. IV, p. 195, "Thoughts on Government"</ref> Adams suggested that there should be a [[separation of powers]] between the [[executive (government)|executive]], the [[judicial]] and the [[legislative]] branches, and further recommended that if a continental government were to be formed then it "should sacredly be confined" to certain [[enumerated powers]]. ''Thoughts on Government'' was referenced in every state-constitution writing hall. Adams used the letter to attack opponents of independence. He claimed that [[John Dickinson]]'s fear of republicanism was responsible for his refusal to support independence, and wrote that opposition from Southern planters was rooted in fear that their aristocratic slaveholding status would be endangered by it.{{sfn|Ferling|1992|pp=155–157}}

===Massachusetts Constitution===
After returning from his first mission to France in 1779, Adams was elected to the [[Massachusetts Constitutional Convention of 1779–1780|Massachusetts Constitutional Convention]] with the purpose of establishing a new constitution for Massachusetts. He served on a committee of three, also including Samuel Adams and [[James Bowdoin]], to draft the constitution. The task of writing it fell primarily to John Adams. The resulting [[Constitution of Massachusetts]] was approved in 1780. It was the first constitution written by a special committee, then ratified by the people; and was the first to feature a bicameral legislature. Included were a distinct executive – though restrained by an executive council – with a qualified (two-thirds) veto, and an independent judicial branch. The judges were given lifetime appointments, allowed to "hold their offices during good behavior."{{sfn|Ferling|1992|pp=214–216}}

The Constitution affirmed the "duty" of the individual to worship the "Supreme Being," and that he had the right to do so without molestation "in the manner most agreeable to the dictates of his own conscience."{{sfn|McCullough|2001|p=222}} It established a system of public education that would provide free schooling for three years to the children of all citizens.{{sfn|Ferling|1992|p=272}} Adams was a strong believer in good education as one of the pillars of the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]]. He believed that people "in a State of Ignorance" were more easily enslaved while those "enlightened with knowledge" would be better able to protect their liberties.{{sfn|Burns|2013|p=76}} Adams became one of the founders of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]] in 1780.{{sfn|Cochrane|1978|p=7}}

===''Defence of the Constitutions''===
Adams' preoccupation with political and governmental affairs–which caused considerable separation from his wife and children–had a distinct familial context, which he articulated in 1780: "I must study Politicks and War that my sons may have the liberty to study Mathematicks and Philosophy. My sons ought to study Geography, natural History, Naval Architecture, navigation, Commerce and Agriculture, in order to give their children a right to study Painting, Poetry, Musick, Architecture, Statuary, Tapestry, and Porcelaine."{{sfn|Ferling|1992|pp=174–175}}

While in London, Adams learned of a [[Constitutional Convention (United States)|convention]] being planned to amend the [[Articles of Confederation]]. In January 1787, he published a work entitled ''A Defence of the Constitutions of Government of the United States''.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.constitution.org/jadams/ja1_00.htm |title=John Adams: Defence of the Constitutions, 1787 |publisher=''Constitution.org'' |accessdate=March 2, 2010 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100125085353/http://www.constitution.org/jadams/ja1_00.htm |archivedate=January 25, 2010 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> The pamphlet repudiated the views of [[Anne Robert Jacques Turgot, Baron de Laune|Turgot]] and other European writers as to the viciousness of state government frameworks. He suggested that "the rich, the well-born and the able" should be set apart from other men in a senate – that would prevent them from dominating the lower house. Adams' ''Defence'' is described as an articulation of the theory of [[mixed government]]. Adams contended that social classes exist in every political society, and that a good government must accept that reality. For centuries, dating back to [[Aristotle]], a mixed regime balancing monarchy, aristocracy, and democracy – that is, the king, the nobles, and the people – was required to preserve order and liberty.{{sfn|Adams|1954|p=xvii}}

Historian [[Gordon S. Wood]] has maintained that Adams' political philosophy had become irrelevant by the time the Federal Constitution was ratified. By then, American political thought, transformed by more than a decade of vigorous debate as well as formative experiential pressures, had abandoned the classical perception of politics as a mirror of social estates. Americans' new understanding of [[popular sovereignty]] was that the citizenry were the sole possessors of power in the nation. Representatives in the government enjoyed mere portions of the people's power and only for a limited time. Adams was thought to have overlooked this evolution and revealed his continued attachment to the older version of politics.{{sfn|Wood|2006|pp=173–202}} Yet Wood was accused of ignoring Adams' peculiar definition of the term "republic," and his support for a constitution ratified by the people.{{sfn|Thompson|1998|p=317}}

On [[separation of powers]], Adams wrote that, "Power must be opposed to power, and interest to interest."<ref name="Works of John Adams, IV:557">Works of John Adams, IV:557</ref> This sentiment was later echoed by James Madison's statement that, "[a]mbition must be made to counteract ambition," in [[Federalist No. 51]], explaining the separation of powers established under the new Constitution.<ref name="Works of John Adams, IV:557"/><ref>{{cite web |last=Madison |first=James|title=The Federalist No. 51 |url=http://en.wikisource.org/w/index.php?title=The_Federalist_Papers/No._51&oldid=504230}}</ref> Adams believed that human beings were naturally desirous of furthering their own ambitions, and a single democratically elected house, if left unchecked, would be subject to this error, and therefore needed to be checked by an upper house and an executive. He wrote that a strong executive would defend the people's liberties against "aristocrats" attempting to take it away.<ref name="Ralston">{{cite web |url=https://www.iep.utm.edu/amer-enl/#SH3d |title=American Enlightenment Thought |last=Ralston |first=Shane J. |publisher=Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy |access-date=July 6, 2018}}</ref> On the government's role in education Adams stated that, "The whole people must take upon themselves the education of the whole people and be willing to bear the expenses of it. There should not be a district of one mile square, without a school in it, not founded by a charitable individual, but maintained at the public expense of the people themselves."<ref>Adams, Letter to [[John Jebb (reformer)|John Jebb]], Vol. 9, p. 540.</ref>

Adams first saw the new [[United States Constitution]] in late 1787. To Jefferson, he wrote that he read it "with great satisfaction." Adams expressed regret that the president would be unable to make appointments without [[United States Senate|Senate]] approval and over the absence of a [[United States Bill of Rights|Bill of Rights]]. "Should not such a thing have preceded the model?" he asked.{{sfn|McCullough|2001|p=379}}

==Political philosophy and views==
===Slavery===
Adams never owned a [[Slavery in the United States|slave]] and declined on principle to utilize slave labor, saying, "I have, through my whole life, held the practice of slavery in such abhorrence, that I have never owned a negro or any other slave, though I have lived for many years in times, when the practice was not disgraceful, when the best men in my vicinity thought it not inconsistent with their character, and when it has cost me thousands of dollars for the labor and subsistence of free men, which I might have saved by the purchase of negroes at times when they were very cheap."<ref name=RJEvans>{{cite web|url=http://oll.libertyfund.org/titles/2127#lf1431-10_head_152|last=Adams|first=John|title=Letter to Robert J. Evans|date=June 8, 1819|publisher=[[Liberty Fund Inc.]]|accessdate=February 3, 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150203234949/http://oll.libertyfund.org/titles/2127#lf1431-10_head_152|archivedate=February 3, 2015|df=mdy-all}}</ref> Before the war, he occasionally represented slaves in suits for their freedom.{{sfn|Ferling|1992|p=77}} Adams generally tried to keep the issue out of national politics, because of the anticipated Southern response during a time when unity was needed to achieve independence. He spoke out in 1777 against a bill to emancipate slaves in Massachusetts, saying that the issue was presently too divisive, and so the legislation should "sleep for a time." He also was against use of black soldiers in the Revolution due to opposition from Southerners.{{sfn|Wiencek|2004|p=215}} Slavery was abolished in Massachusetts about 1780, when it was forbidden by implication in the Declaration of Rights that John Adams wrote into the Massachusetts Constitution.{{sfn|Moore|1866|pp=200–203}} Abigail Adams vocally opposed slavery.{{sfn|McCullough|2001|p=26}}

===Accusations of monarchism===
Throughout his lifetime Adams expressed controversial and shifting views regarding the virtues of monarchical and hereditary political institutions.<ref name="Mark O. Hatfield, Vice Pres">{{cite web|first=Mark O.|last=Hatfield|year=1997|url=https://www.senate.gov/artandhistory/history/resources/pdf/john_adams.pdf|title=Vice Presidents of the United States|publisher=U.S. Government Printing Office|pages=3–11|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121219094306/https://www.senate.gov/artandhistory/history/resources/pdf/john_adams.pdf|archivedate=December 19, 2012|df=mdy-all}}</ref> At times he conveyed substantial support for these approaches, suggesting for example that "hereditary monarchy or aristocracy" are the "only institutions that can possibly preserve the laws and liberties of the people."{{sfn|Adams|1892|p=38}} Yet at other times he distanced himself from such ideas, calling himself "a mortal and irreconcilable enemy to Monarchy" and "no friend to hereditary limited monarchy in America."{{sfn|McCullough|2001|p=410}} Such denials did not assuage his critics, and Adams was often accused of being a monarchist.<ref name="John & Abigail Adams">{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/adams/peopleevents/p_callender.html|title=John & Abigail Adams|publisher=PBS online|accessdate=July 17, 2013|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130730143702/http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/adams/peopleevents/p_callender.html|archivedate=July 30, 2013|df=mdy-all}}</ref> Historian [[Clinton Rossiter]] portrays Adams not as a monarchist but a revolutionary conservative who sought to balance republicanism with the stability of monarchy to create "ordered liberty."{{sfn|Rossiter|1955|p=114}} His 1790 ''Discourses on Davila'' published in the ''Gazette of the United States'' warned once again of the dangers of unbridled democracy.{{sfn|McCullough|2001|p=421}}

[[File:Gilbert Stuart John Adams.jpg|thumb|John Adams by [[Gilbert Stuart]] (1823). This portrait was the last ever made of Adams, done at the request of John Quincy.{{sfn|McCullough|2001|p=638}}|alt=An elderly man sits in a red chair with his arms crossed, looking slightly left.]]
Many of these attacks are considered to have been scurrilous, including suggestions that he was planning to "crown himself king" and "grooming John Quincy as heir to the throne."<ref name="John & Abigail Adams"/> Peter Shaw has argued that: "[T]he inevitable attacks on Adams, crude as they were, stumbled on a truth that he did not admit to himself. He was leaning toward monarchy and aristocracy (as distinct from kings and aristocrats) ... Decidedly, sometime after he became vice-president, Adams concluded that the United States would have to adopt a hereditary legislature and a monarch ... and he outlined a plan by which state conventions would appoint hereditary senators while a national one appointed a president for life."{{sfn|Shaw|1975|pp=230–237}} In contrast to such notions, Adams asserted in a letter to Thomas Jefferson:

{{quote|If you suppose that I have ever had a design or desire of attempting to introduce a government of King, Lords and Commons, or in other words an hereditary Executive, or an hereditary Senate, either into the government of the United States, or that of any individual state, in this country, you are wholly mistaken. There is not such a thought expressed or intimated in any public writing or private letter of mine, and I may safely challenge all of mankind to produce such a passage and quote the chapter and verse.{{sfn|Adams|2004|p=466}}}}

According to Luke Mayville, Adams synthesized two strands of thought: [[political science|practical study]] of past and present governments, and [[Scottish Enlightenment]] thinking concerning individual desires expressed in politics.{{sfn|Mayville|2016|pp=11–14}} Adams conclusion was that the great danger was that an [[oligarchy]] of the wealthy would take hold to the detriment of equality. To counter that danger, the power of the wealthy needed to be channeled by institutions, and checked by a strong executive.{{sfn|Mayville|2016|pp=11–14}}<ref name="Ralston"/>

===Religious views===

Adams was raised a [[Congregational church|Congregationalist]], since his ancestors were Puritans. According to biographer [[David McCullough]], "as his family and friends knew, Adams was both a devout Christian, and an independent thinker, and he saw no conflict in that."{{sfn|McCullough|2001|p=18}} In a letter to Rush, Adams credited religion with the success of his ancestors since their migration to the New World.{{sfn|McCullough|2001|p=22}} He believed that regular church service was beneficial to man's moral sense. Everett (1966) concludes that "Adams strove for a religion based on a common sense sort of reasonableness" and maintained that religion must change and evolve toward perfection.{{sfn|Everett|1966|pp=49–57}} Fielding (1940) argues that Adams' beliefs synthesized Puritan, [[deism|deist]], and [[humanism|humanist]] concepts. Adams at one point said that Christianity had originally been [[revelation|revelatory]], but was being misinterpreted in the service of superstition, fraud, and unscrupulous power.{{sfn|Fielding|1940|pp=33–46}}

Frazer (2004) notes that while he shared many perspectives with deists and often used deistic terminology, "Adams clearly was not a deist. Deism rejected any and all supernatural activity and intervention by God; consequently, deists did not believe in miracles or God's providence.&nbsp;... Adams did believe in miracles, providence, and, to a certain extent, the Bible as revelation."<ref>Frazer, Gregg L. (2004). ''The Political Theology of the American Founding''. PhD dissertation. Claremont Graduate University. p. 46.</ref> Frazer argues that Adams' "theistic rationalism, like that of the other Founders, was a sort of middle ground between Protestantism and deism."<ref>Frazer, Gregg L. (2004). ''The Political Theology of the American Founding''. PhD dissertation. Claremont Graduate University. p. 50.</ref> In 1796, Adams denounced [[Thomas Paine]]'s deistic criticisms of Christianity in ''[[The Age of Reason]]'', saying, "The Christian religion is, above all the religions that ever prevailed or existed in ancient or modern times, the religion of wisdom, virtue, equity and humanity, let the Blackguard Paine say what he will."<ref>{{cite web |url=https://founders.archives.gov/documents/Adams/01-03-02-0013-0002-0015 |title=July 26. 1796. Tuesday. [from the Diary of John Adams] |publisher=Adams Papers, Massachusetts Historical Society |access-date=September 29, 2018}}</ref>

But historian [[Gordon S. Wood]] (2017) writes, "Although both Jefferson and Adams denied the miracles of the Bible and the divinity of Christ, Adams always retained a respect for the religiosity of people that Jefferson never had; in fact, Jefferson tended in private company to mock religious feelings."{{sfn|Wood|2017|p=16}}

In his retirement years, Adams moved away from some of the Puritan sentiments of his youth and closer to more mainstream Enlightenment religious ideals. He blamed institutional Christianity for causing much suffering but continued to be an active Christian while maintaining that religion was necessary for society. He became a [[Unitarianism|Unitarian]], rejecting the divinity of [[Jesus]].{{sfn|Ferling|1992|pp=433–434}} David L. Holmes argues that Adams, while adopting central tenets of the Unitarian creed, accepted Jesus as the redeemer of humanity and the biblical accounts of [[Miracles of Jesus|his miracles]] as true.{{sfn|Holmes|2006|pp=73–78}}

===Historical reputation===
{{see also|Bibliography of John Adams}}
Franklin summed up what many thought of Adams when he said, "He means well for his country, is always an honest man, often a wise one, but sometimes, and in some things, absolutely out of his senses."{{sfn|Chernow|2004|p=518}} Adams came to be seen as someone with a long, distinguished, and spotless career in public service, and a man of great patriotism and integrity, but whose vanity, stubbornness, and cantankerousness often got him into unnecessary trouble. Adams strongly felt that he would be forgotten and underappreciated by history. These feelings often manifested themselves through envy and verbal attacks on other Founders.{{sfn|Ferling|1992|p=310}}{{sfn|Chernow|2004|p=520}}

Historian George Herring argues that Adams was the most independent-minded of the Founders.{{sfn|Herring|2008|p=89}} Though he formally aligned with the Federalists, he was somewhat a party unto himself, at times disagreeing with the Federalists as much as he did the Republicans.{{sfn|Chernow|2004|p=647}} He was often described as "prickly", but his tenacity was fed by good decisions made in the face of universal opposition.{{sfn|Herring|2008|p=89}} Adams was often combative, which diminished presidential decorum, as he admitted in his old age: "[As President] I refused to suffer in silence. I sighed, sobbed, and groaned, and sometimes screeched and screamed. And I must confess to my shame and sorrow that I sometimes swore."{{sfn|Ellis|1993|p=57}} Stubbornness was seen as one of his defining traits, a fact for which Adams made no apology. "Thanks to God that he gave me stubbornness when I know I am right," he wrote.{{sfn|McCullough|2001|p=272}} His resolve to advance peace with France while maintaining a posture of defense reduced his popularity and contributed to his defeat for reelection.{{sfn|Herring|2008|pp=90–91}} Most historians applaud him for avoiding an all-out war with France during his presidency. His signing of the Alien and Sedition Acts is almost always condemned.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://millercenter.org/president/adams/impact-and-legacy |title=John Adams: Impact and Legacy |last=Taylor |first=C. James |location=Charlottesville, VA |publisher=Miller Center of Public Affairs, University of Virginia |access-date=October 30, 2016|date=2016-10-04 }}</ref>

According to Ferling, Adams' political philosophy fell "out of step" with the way that the country was heading. The country tended further away from Adams' emphasis on order and the rule of law and towards the Jeffersonian vision of liberty and weak central government. In the years following his retirement from public life, as first [[Jeffersonian democracy|Jeffersonianism]] and then [[Jacksonian democracy]] grew to dominate American politics, Adams was largely forgotten.{{sfn|Ferling|1992|p=4}} When his name was mentioned, it was typically not in a favorable way. In the [[United States presidential election, 1840|1840 presidential election]], [[Whig Party (United States)|Whig]] candidate [[William Henry Harrison]] was attacked by [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrats]] on the false allegation that he had once been a supporter of John Adams.{{sfn|Shafer|2016|pp=128–129}} Adams was eventually subject to criticism from [[states' rights]] advocates. [[Edward A. Pollard]], a strong supporter of the [[Confederate States of America|Confederacy]] during the [[American Civil War]], singled out Adams, writing:

{{quote|The first President from the North, John Adams, asserted and essayed to put into practice the supremacy of the "National" power over the states and the citizens thereof. He was sustained in his attempted usurpations by all the New England states and by a powerful public sentiment in each of the Middle States. The "[[strict constructionism|strict constructionists]]" of the Constitution were not slow in raising the standard of opposition against a pernicious error.{{sfn|Pollard|1862|p=12}}}}

In the 21st century, Adams remains less well known than many of America's other Founding Fathers. McCullough argued that "[t]he problem with Adams is that most Americans know nothing about him." Todd Leopold of [[CNN]] wrote in 2001 that Adams is "remembered as that guy who served a single term as president between Washington and Jefferson, and as a short, vain, somewhat rotund man whose stature seems to have been dwarfed by his lanky colleagues."<ref name="CNN">{{cite news |url=http://www.cnn.com/2001/SHOWBIZ/books/06/07/david.mccullough/ |title=David McCullough brings 'John Adams' to life |last=Leopold |first=Todd |publisher=CNN |date=June 7, 2006 |access-date=October 30, 2016}}</ref> He has always been seen, Ferling says, as "honest and dedicated", but despite his lengthy career in public service, Adams is still overshadowed by the dramatic military and political achievements and strong personalities of his contemporaries.{{sfn|Ferling|1992|pp=2–3}} Gilbert Chinard, in his 1933 biography of Adams, described the man as "staunch, honest stubborn and somewhat narrow."{{sfn|Chinard|1933|p=vi}} In his two-volume 1962 biography, Page Smith lauds Adams for his fight against radicals such as Thomas Paine, whose promised reforms portended anarchy and misery. Ferling, in his 1992 biography, writes that "Adams was his own worst enemy." He criticizes him for his "pettiness ... jealousy, and vanity", and faults him for his frequent separations from his wife and children. He praises Adams for his willingness to acknowledge his deficiencies and for striving to overcome them. In 1995, Peter Shaw published ''The Character of John Adams''. Ferling believes that the man who emerges is one "perpetually at war with himself", whose desire for fame and recognition leads to charges of vanity.{{sfn|Ferling|1992|pp=3–4}}

In 2001, David McCullough published a biography of the president entitled ''[[John Adams (book)|John Adams]]''. McCullough lauds Adams for consistency and honesty, "plays down or explains away" his more controversial actions, such as the dispute over presidential titles and the predawn flight from the White House, and criticizes his friend and rival, Jefferson. The book sold very well and was very favorably received and, along with the Ferling biography, contributed to a rapid resurgence in Adams' reputation.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/books/01/05/27/reviews/010527.27maiert.html |title=Plain Speaking: In David McCullough's telling, the second president is reminiscent of the 33rd (Harry Truman) |last=Maier |first=Pauline |date=May 27, 2001 |work=The New York Times |access-date=November 7, 2017}}</ref> In 2008, a [[John Adams (miniseries)|miniseries]] was released based on the McCullough biography, featuring [[Paul Giamatti]] as Adams.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/la-ca-giamatti13apr13-story.html |title=Paul Giamatti is so imperfect for the role |last=Lieberman |first=Paul |date=April 13, 2008 |work=Los Angeles Times |access-date=January 10, 2018}}</ref>

{{s-ref|While Adams won the vice presidency in [[United States presidential election, 1789|1789]] as well, he was not the candidate of the Federalist Party, which had not yet formed.|Technically, Adams was a presidential candidate in 1792 and Pinckney was a presidential candidate in 1796. Prior to the passage of the [[Twelfth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Twelfth Amendment]] in 1804, each presidential elector could cast two ballots; the highest vote-getter would become president and the runner-up would become vice president. Thus, in 1792, with [[George Washington]] as the prohibitive favorite for president, the Federalist party fielded Adams as a presidential candidate, with the intention that he be elected to the vice presidency. Similarly, in 1796 and 1800, the Federalist party fielded two candidates, Adams and Thomas Pinckney, in 1796 and Adams and [[Charles Cotesworth Pinckney|Charles Pinckney]] in 1800, with the intention that Adams be elected president and Pinckney be elected vice president.}}
