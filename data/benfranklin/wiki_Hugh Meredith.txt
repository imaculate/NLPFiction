'''Hugh Meredith''' (c. 1697 - c. 1749) was a farmer and printer in the [[Thirteen Colonies|American colonies]], who briefly had a partnership with [[Benjamin Franklin]] as publishers of the ''[[Pennsylvania Gazette]]''.

Meredith was of Welsh descent and born outside Philadelphia, where he was a farmer.  At the age of 30, he took an apprenticeship to learn printing.  Franklin and Meredith worked under [[Samuel Keimer]], and Meredith was an original member of the [[Junto (club)|Junto]] club founded by Franklin.

Around 1728 the two formed a partnership, with Meredith's father providing half of the needed money for the venture.  They bought Keimer's ''Universal Instructor in all Arts and Sciences: and Pennsylvania Gazette'' in 1729.   By the next year, Franklin acted to buy out Meredith's interest.  By May 1732 Franklin had acquired complete ownership of the ''Gazette''.<ref>{{cite book|author=William S.

In the summer of 1730 Meredith moved to the Welsh Tract settlement in the Cape Fear region of [[North Carolina]], claiming on departure that he planned to "follow my old employment", which evidently meant farming as the colony had no printers until 1749.  As part of their division of the business, Meredith asked for a new saddle.

In 1731, Franklin published two letters from Meredith in the ''Gazette'', which described conditions in the North Carolina Welsh settlements.

It is likely that Meredith later returned to Pennsylvania, as Franklin lent him some money in 1739.<ref>{{cite book|author=J. A.
