The '''United States Department of State''' ('''DOS'''),<ref>http://2001-2009.state.gov/g/oes/rlnks/gl/</ref> commonly referred to as the '''State Department''', is the [[United States federal executive departments|federal executive department]] that advises the President and conducts [[international relations]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.usa.gov/federal-agencies/department-of-state|title=Department of State {{!}} USAGov|website=www.usa.gov|accessdate=November 24, 2016|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161125045405/https://www.usa.gov/federal-agencies/department-of-state|archivedate=November 25, 2016}}</ref> Equivalent to the [[foreign ministry]] of other countries, it was established in 1789 as the nation's first executive department.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://history.state.gov/departmenthistory/short-history/framework|title=A New Framework for Foreign Affairs |date=March 14, 2015|accessdate=March 14, 2015|website=A Short History of the Department of State|publisher=U.S. Department of State}}</ref> The current Secretary of State is Mike Pompeo, who ascended to the office in April 2018 after Rex Tillerson resigned.

The State Department's duties include implementing the [[foreign policy of the United States]], operating the nation's [[List of diplomatic missions of the United States|diplomatic missions abroad]], negotiating treaties and agreements with foreign entities, and representing the United States at the [[United Nations]]. It is led by the [[United States Secretary of State|Secretary of State]], a  member of the [[Cabinet of the United States|Cabinet]] who is nominated by the [[President of the United States|President]] and [[Advice and consent|confirmed]] by the [[United States Senate|Senate]]. In addition to administering the department, the Secretary of State serves as the nation's chief diplomat and representative abroad. The Secretary of State is the first Cabinet official in the [[United States order of precedence|order of precedence]] and in the [[United States presidential line of succession|presidential line of succession]], after the [[Vice President of the United States]], [[Speaker of the United States House of Representatives|Speaker of the House of Representatives]], and [[President pro tempore of the United States Senate|President pro tempore of the Senate]].

The State Department is headquartered in the [[Harry S Truman Building]], a few blocks away from the [[White House]], in the [[Foggy Bottom, Washington, D.C.|Foggy Bottom]] neighborhood of [[Washington, D.C.]]; "Foggy Bottom" is thus sometimes used as a [[metonym]].

==History==
[[File:State Department Building, Washington, D. C., 1865.png|left|thumb|Old State Department building in [[Washington, D.C.]], {{circa|1865}}]]
The [[United States Constitution|U.S. Constitution]], drafted in [[Philadelphia]] in September 1787 and [[ratified]] by the 13 states the following year, gave the [[President of the United States|President]] the responsibility for the conduct of the nation's foreign relations.

The [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] and [[United States Senate|Senate]] approved legislation to establish a '''Department of Foreign Affairs''' on July 21, 1789, and President Washington signed it into law on July 27, making the Department of Foreign Affairs the first federal agency to be created under the new Constitution.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://rs6.loc.gov/cgi-bin/ampage?collId=llsl&fileName=001/llsl001.db&recNum=151|title=1 United States Statutes at Large, Chapter 4, Section 1|publisher=}}</ref> This legislation remains the basic law of the Department of State. In September 1789, additional legislation changed the name of the agency to the Department of State and assigned to it a variety of domestic duties.

These responsibilities grew to include management of the [[United States Mint]], keeper of the [[Great Seal of the United States]], and the taking of the [[United States Census Bureau|census]]. President [[George Washington]] signed the new legislation on September 15.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.glin.gov/view.action?glinID=85633|title=United States Statutes at Large, First Congress, Session 1, Chapter 14|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120623022341/http://www.glin.gov/view.action?glinID=85633|archivedate=June 23, 2012}}</ref> Most of these domestic duties of the Department of State were eventually turned over to various new Federal departments and agencies that were established during the 19th century. However, the Secretary of State still retains a few domestic responsibilities, such as being the keeper of the [[Great Seal of the United States|Great Seal]] and being the officer to whom a President or Vice President of the United States wishing to resign must deliver an [[Letter of resignation|instrument in writing]] declaring the decision to resign.

On September 29, 1789, President Washington appointed [[Thomas Jefferson]] of [[Virginia]], then [[United States Ambassador to France|Minister to France]], to be the first [[United States Secretary of State]].<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://future.state.gov/when/timeline/1784_timeline.html |author=[[Bureau of Public Affairs]] |publisher=United States Department of State |title=1784–1800: New Republic |accessdate=May 11, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130501010334/http://future.state.gov/when/timeline/1784_timeline.html |archivedate=May 1, 2013  }}</ref> [[John Jay]] had been serving in as Secretary of Foreign Affairs as a holdover from the Confederation since before Washington had taken office and would continue in that capacity until Jefferson returned from Europe many months later.

From 1790 to 1800, the State Department had its headquarters in Philadelphia, the capital of the United States at the time. It occupied a building at Church and Fifth Streets (although, for a short period during which a [[yellow fever]] epidemic ravaged the city, it resided in the [[New Jersey State House]] in [[Trenton, New Jersey]]).<ref name="Plischke">Plischke, Elmer.

[[Hillary Clinton]] became the third female secretary of state when she was appointed in 2009.

The Executive Branch and the [[United States Congress|U.S. Congress]] have [[United States Constitution|constitutional]] responsibilities for U.S. foreign policy. Within the Executive Branch, the Department of State is the lead U.S. foreign affairs agency, and its head, the Secretary of State, is the President's principal foreign policy advisor. The Department advances U.S. objectives and interests in the world through its primary role in developing and implementing the President's foreign policy. It also provides an array of important services to U.S. citizens and to foreigners seeking to visit or immigrate to the United States. All foreign affairs activities—U.S. representation abroad, foreign assistance programs, countering international crime, foreign military training programs, the services the Department provides, and more—are paid for by the foreign affairs budget, which represents little more than 1% of the total federal budget. As stated by the Department of State, its purpose includes:
* Protecting and assisting [[U.S. citizen]]s living or traveling abroad;
* Assisting U.S. [[business]]es in the international marketplace;
* Coordinating and providing support for international activities of other U.S. agencies (local, state, or federal government), official visits overseas and at home, and other diplomatic efforts.
* Keeping the public informed about U.S. foreign policy and relations with other countries and providing feedback from the public to administration officials.
* Providing [[diplomatic license plates in the United States|automobile registration]] for non-diplomatic staff vehicles and the vehicles of diplomats of foreign countries having [[diplomatic immunity]] in the United States.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.state.gov/documents/organization/150546.pdf |page=15 |title=Diplomatic and Consular Immunity: Guidance for Law Enforcement and Judicial Authorities |date=July 2011 |accessdate=May 11, 2012 |author=United States Department of State, Bureau of Diplomatic Security |publisher=United States Department of State}}</ref>

The Department of State conducts these activities with a civilian workforce, and normally uses the Foreign Service personnel system for positions that require service abroad. Employees may be assigned to diplomatic missions abroad to represent The United States, analyze and report on political, economic, and social trends; adjudicate visas; and respond to the needs of U.S. citizens abroad. The U.S. maintains diplomatic relations with about 180 countries and maintains relations with many international organizations, adding up to a total of more than 250 posts around the world. In the United States, about 5,000 professional, technical, and administrative employees work compiling and analyzing reports from overseas, providing logistical support to posts, communicating with the American public, formulating and overseeing the budget, issuing passports and [[warden message|travel warnings]], and more. In carrying out these responsibilities, the Department of State works in close coordination with other federal agencies, including the [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]], the Department of the Treasury, and the Department of Commerce. As required by the principle of [[Separation of powers#Checks_and_balances|checks and balances]], the Department also consults with Congress about foreign policy initiatives and policies.

BioPrepWatch reported that, on May 30, 2013, the State Department submitted the ''Country Reports on Terrorism 2012'' to Congress. Most [[terrorist]] attacks have been decentralized and target the  [[Middle East]] countries. There have been no other reports that have previously talked about this topic, but the biggest shifts in terrorism in 2012 included an increase in [[state-sponsored terrorism]] in Iran. The State Department states the best way to counter international terrorist attacks is to work with international partners to cut funding, strengthen law-enforcing institutions and eliminate terrorist safe havens.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bioprepwatch.com/threats/state-department-submits-terrorism-report-to-congress/330554/ |title=State Department submits terrorism report to Congress |last1=Sievers |first1=Lisa |date=June 4, 2013 |publisher=BioPrepWatch |accessdate=June 6, 2013 }}{{Dead link|date=December 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>

==The Fulbright Program==
[[File:Mike Pompeo with Department of State Summer Interns - 2018 (43952374221).jpg|thumb|400px|Mike Pompeo with 2018 summer interns]]
The Fulbright Program, including the Fulbright–Hays Program, is a program of competitive, merit-based [[Grant (money)|grants]] for [[United States Cultural Exchange Programs|international educational exchange]] for students, scholars, teachers, professionals, scientists and artists, founded by [[United States Senator]] [[J. William Fulbright]] in 1946.  Under the Fulbright Program, competitively selected U.S. citizens may become eligible for scholarships to study, conduct research, or exercise their talents abroad; and citizens of other countries may qualify to do the same in the United States. The program was established to increase mutual understanding between the people of the United States and other countries through the exchange of persons, knowledge, and skills.

The Fulbright Program provides 8,000 grants annually to undertake graduate study, advanced research, university lecturing, and classroom teaching. In the 2015–16 cycle, 17% and 24% of American applicants were successful in securing research and English Teaching Assistance grants, respectively. However, selectivity and application numbers vary substantially by country and by type of grant. For example, grants were awarded to 30% of Americans applying to teach English in Laos and 50% of applicants to do research in Laos. In contrast, 6% of applicants applying to teach English in Belgium were successful compared to 16% of applicants to do research in Belgium.<ref>{{Cite web|title = ETA Grant Application Statistics|url = http://us.fulbrightonline.org/eta-grant-application-statistics|website = us.fulbrightonline.org|accessdate = December 25, 2015|deadurl = yes|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20151225170917/http://us.fulbrightonline.org/eta-grant-application-statistics|archivedate = December 25, 2015|df = mdy-all}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title = Study/Research Grant Application Statistics|url = http://us.fulbrightonline.org/studyresearch-grant-application-statistics|website = us.fulbrightonline.org|accessdate = December 25, 2015|deadurl = yes|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20151225182159/http://us.fulbrightonline.org/studyresearch-grant-application-statistics|archivedate = December 25, 2015|df = mdy-all}}</ref>

The U.S. Department of State's [[Bureau of Educational and Cultural Affairs]] sponsors the Fulbright Program from an annual appropriation from the U.S. Congress.  Additional direct and in-kind support comes from partner governments, foundations, corporations, and host institutions both in and outside the U.S.<ref name="Fulbright Program Fact Sheet">{{cite web |title = Fulbright Program Fact Sheet|publisher = U.S. Department of State|url = http://eca.state.gov/files/bureau/fulbright_fact_sheet_2.pdf}}</ref> The Fulbright Program is administered by cooperating organizations like the [[Institute of International Education]].

The Jefferson Science Fellows Program was established in 2003 by the DoS to establish a new model for engaging the American academic science, technology, engineering and medical communities in the formulation and implementation of U.S. foreign policy.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.macfound.org/press/press-releases/macarthur-supports-new-science-and-security-fellowship-program-at-us-department-of-state-october-8-2002/ |title=MacArthur Supports New Science and Security Fellowship Program at U.S. Department of State |publisher=MacArthur Foundation |date=October 8, 2002 |accessdate=February 1, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://careers.state.gov/work/fellowships/jefferson-science |title=Jefferson Science Fellowship Program &ndash; U.S. Department of State |accessdate=February 1, 2015 }}</ref> The Fellows as they are called if chose for this program are paid around $50,000 during the duration and can earn special bonuses of up to $10,000. The whole point of this program is so that these Fellows will know the ins and outs of the Department of State/USAID to help with the daily functioning.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://sites.nationalacademies.org/pga/jefferson/pga_048242|title=About the Jefferson Science Fellowship|website=sites.nationalacademies.org|access-date=2018-10-31}}</ref> There is no one winner every year rather it's a program that you apply for and follow a process that starts in August and takes a full year to learn the final results of your ranking. It isn't solely based on achievement alone but intelligence and writing skills that have to show that you encompass all of what the committee is looking for. First you start with the online application then you start to write your curriculum vitae which explains more about yourself and your education and job experience then you move onto your statement of interest and essay where you have your common essay and your briefing memo. Finally you wrap up with letters of recommendations and letters of nominations to show that you are not the only person who believes that they should be a part of this program.

==Franklin Fellows Program==
The Franklin Fellows Program was established in 2006 by the DoS to bring in mid-level executives from the [[private sector]] and [[non-profit organization]]s to advise the Department and to work on projects.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20120302094944/http://www.lmdulye.com/oldp/october07/print/AlumniCorner1.pdf Operation Development Leadership Project, Alumni Corner, September 2007]</ref> Fellows may also work with other government entities, including [[United States Congress|the Congress]], [[White House]], and [[United States Executive Branch|executive branch]] agencies, including the [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]], [[United States Department of Commerce|Department of Commerce]], and [[United States Department of Homeland Security|Department of Homeland Security]]. The program is named in honor of [[Benjamin Franklin]], and aims to bring mid-career professionals to enrich and expand the Department's capabilities. Unlike the Jefferson Science Fellows Program this is based on volunteer work as you do not get paid to be a part of this. Rather you have sponsors or you contribute your own money in order to fulfill what it will take to do the year long program. The more seniority you have in this program determines what kind of topics you work on and the priority that the issues are to the country. Although the bottom line is that the other Fellows are the ones with the final say of where you are placed however they try to take into account where you would like to be placed.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://careers.state.gov/work/fellowships/franklin-fellows/|title=Franklin Fellows Program - Careers|website=careers.state.gov|language=en-US|access-date=2018-10-31}}</ref>

==Department of State Air Wing==
[[File:State Air Wing.png|thumb|Logo of the "Air Wing" of The Bureau of International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs (INL)- Office of Aviation, U.S. Department of State]]
In 1978, the Bureau for International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs (INL) formed an office to use excess military and government aircraft for support of foreign nations' counter-narcotics operations. The first aircraft used was a crop duster used for eradication of illicit crops in Mexico in cooperation with the local authorities. The separate Air Wing was established in 1986 as use of aviation assets grew in the war on drugs.<ref name="USDoSMagazine">{{cite web |url=https://www.state.gov/documents/organization/161997.pdf |title=US Department Of State Magazine, May 2011}}</ref>

The aircraft fleet grew from crop spraying aircraft to larger transports and helicopters used to support ground troops and transport personnel. As these operations became more involved in direct combat, a further need for search and rescue and armed escort helicopters was evident. Operations in the 1980s and 1990s were primarily carried out in [[Colombia]], [[Guatemala]], [[Peru]], [[Bolivia]] and [[Belize]]. Many aircraft have since been passed on to the governments involved, as they became capable of taking over the operations themselves.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}

Following the events of the [[September 11 attacks]], and the subsequent war on terror, the Air Wing went on to expand their operations from mainly anti-narcotics operations to also support security of United States nationals and interests, primarily in Afghanistan and Pakistan. Safe transport for various diplomatic missions were undertaken, requiring the acquisition of larger aircraft types, such as [[Sikorsky S-61]], [[Boeing Vertol CH-46 Sea Knight|Boeing Vertol CH-46]], [[Beechcraft King Air]] and [[Bombardier Dash 8|De Haviland DHC-8-300]]. In 2011, the Air Wing was operating more than 230 aircraft around the world, the main missions still being counter narcotics and transportation of state officials.<ref name="USDoSMagazine"/>

==Freedom of Information Act processing performance==
In the latest [[Center for Effective Government]] analysis of 15 federal agencies which receive the most [[Freedom of Information Act (United States) | Freedom of Information Act]] (FOIA) requests published in 2015 (using 2012 and 2013 data, the most recent years available), the State Department was the lowest performer, earning an F by scoring only 37 out of a possible 100 points, i.e. failed the grade, unchanged from 2013. The State Department's score was dismal due to its extremely low processing score of 23 percent, which was completely out of line with any other agency's performance.<ref>[http://www.foreffectivegov.org/access-to-information-scorecard-2015/ Making the Grade: Access to Information Scorecard 2015] March 2015, 80 pages, [[Center for Effective Government]], retrieved March 21, 2016</ref>
