The '''United States Ambassador to France''' is the official representative of the President of the United States to the President of France. The United States has maintained diplomatic relations with France since the [[American Revolution]]. Relations were upgraded to the higher [[Diplomatic rank|rank]] of Ambassador in 1893. The diplomatic relationship has continued through France's five republics, two empires, and three monarchies. Since 2006 the ambassador to France has also served as the [[List of ambassadors of the United States to Monaco|ambassador to Monaco]]

=== Ministers to the Court of Versailles (1778–1792) ===

Relations between the United States and the French Court of Versailles were established in 1778 with the signing of the [[Treaty of Amity and Commerce (United States–France)|Treaty of Amity and Commerce]].  As a republic, the United States was not entitled to send an ambassador. Instead, relations were maintained at the lower [[diplomatic rank]] of ''Minister''. The position was formally known as the ''Minister Plenipotentiary from the United States of America at the Court of Versailles''.

Diplomatic relations were broken in 1796 due to French anger at U.S. neutrality in the [[War of the First Coalition]].  After the [[French Directory|Directory]] refused to accept [[Charles Cotesworth Pinckney]]'s credentials, a commission was appointed to negotiate with the French Republic.  The members of the commission — Pinckney, [[John Marshall]], and [[Elbridge Gerry]] — were all accredited with the rank of ''Envoy Extraordinary and Minister Plenipotentiary''.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Pinckney|first1=Charles Cotesworth|last2=Gerry|first2=Elbridge|last3=Marshall|first3=John|title=Authentic Copies of the Correspondence of Charles Cotesworth Pinckney, John Marshall, and Elbridge Gerry, Esqrs.

Hostilities culminated in the outbreak of the [[Quasi-War]] between the U.S. and France.  Diplomatic relations were restored with the [[Convention of 1800]].

The [[Congress of Vienna]] standardized the system of [[diplomatic rank]]s. The United States continued to send a ''Minister'', who was officially credentialed as an ''Envoy Extraordinary and Minister Plenipotentiary''.
