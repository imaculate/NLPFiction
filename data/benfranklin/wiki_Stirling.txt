'''Stirling''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|s|t|ɜɹ|l|ɪ|ŋ}}; {{lang-sco|Stirlin}}; {{lang-gd|Sruighlea}} {{IPA-gd|ˈs̪t̪ɾuʝlə|}}) is a [[City status in the United Kingdom|city]] in [[Central Belt|central]] [[Scotland]].

Located on the [[River Forth]], Stirling is the administrative centre for the [[Stirling (council area)|Stirling council area]], and is traditionally the county town of [[Stirlingshire]]. Proverbially it is the strategically important "Gateway to the Highlands".

It has been said that "Stirling, like a huge [[brooch]] clasps [[Scottish Highlands|Highlands]] and [[Scottish Lowlands|Lowlands]] together".<ref>{{cite web|last1=Smith|first1=Alexander|title=quotation 1856|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=cI_YBAAAQBAJ&pg=PT27&dq=alexander+smith+stirling+brooch&hl=en&sa=X&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q=alexander%20smith%20stirling%20brooch&f=false|website=quoted in The Story of Stirling by Bruce Durie chapter 2|publisher=The History Press|accessdate=3 April 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last1=[[Alexander Smith (poet)|Smith]]|first1=Alexander|title=A summer in Skye|date=1865|publisher=Sampson Low, Marston|location=London|url=https://archive.org/stream/summerinskye00smit#page/46/mode/2up/search/brooch|accessdate=6 April 2017}}</ref> Similarly "he who holds Stirling, holds Scotland" is often quoted.

Once the capital of Scotland, Stirling is visually dominated by [[Stirling Castle]]. Stirling also has a medieval parish church, the [[Church of the Holy Rude]], where, on 29 July 1567, the infant [[James VI]] was anointed King of Scots by the [[Adam Bothwell|Bishop of Orkney]] with the service concluding after a sermon by [[John Knox]].<ref>{{cite book|last1=Stair-Kerr|first1=Eric|title=Stirling Castle: its place in Scottish history|date=1913|publisher=James Maclehose and Sons|location=Glasgow|page=79|url=https://archive.org/stream/stirlingcastleit00stai#page/79/mode/1up/|accessdate=5 April 2017}}</ref> The poet King was educated by [[George Buchanan]] and grew up in Stirling. He was later also crowned King of England and Ireland on 25 July 1603, bringing closer the countries of the United Kingdom.

Modern Stirling is a centre for local government, higher education, tourism, retail, and industry. The mid-2012 census estimate for the population of [[List of towns and cities in Scotland by population#Localities|the city]] is 36,440; the wider Stirling council area has a population of about 93,750.<ref>{{cite web|title=Population estimates|url=http://my.stirling.gov.uk/services/council-and-government/council-information-performance-and-statistics/population-estimates|website=Stirling Council|accessdate=4 November 2017}}</ref>

One of the principal royal strongholds of the [[Kingdom of Scotland]], Stirling was created a [[royal burgh]] by [[David I of Scotland|King David I]] in 1130. In 2002, as part of [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Queen Elizabeth]]'s [[Golden Jubilee of Elizabeth II|Golden Jubilee]], Stirling was granted [[City status in the United Kingdom|city status]].

[[File:Old bridge Stirling Scotland.jpg|Old bridge Stirling Scotland|right|thumb|The Auld Brig at Stirling]]The castle rock has been strategically significant since at least the [[Roman Britain|Roman occupation of Britain]], due to its naturally defensible [[crag and tail]] hill: the bedrock on which Stirling Castle was built. However, if the Romans were ever on the current castle site then they didn't leave more than a coin or two. Nevertheless, Stirling enjoys a unique position on the border between the [[Scottish Lowlands|Lowlands]] and [[Scottish Highlands|Highlands]].

Stirling was first declared a [[royal burgh]] by [[David I of Scotland|King David]] in the 12th century, with later charters reaffirmed by subsequent monarchs. A [[ferry]], and later [[Stirling Bridge|bridge]], on the River Forth at Stirling brought wealth and strategic influence, as did its tidal port at Riverside.<ref>{{cite web|title=Riverside Heritage Trail|url=http://www.stirling.gov.uk/__documents/temporary-uploads/employment,-community-_and_-youth/sht-2014/communitiesteam_shtriverside-boards.pdf|website=Stirling Council|accessdate=3 April 2017}}</ref>  Major battles during the [[Wars of Scottish Independence]] took place at the [[Battle of Stirling Bridge|Stirling Bridge]] in 1297 and at the nearby village of [[Battle of Bannockburn|Bannockburn]] in 1314 involving [[William Wallace]] and [[Robert the Bruce]] respectively. After the battle of Stirling Bridge, Wallace wrote to the [[Hanseatic League|Hanseatic]] leaders of [[Lübeck]] and [[Hamburg]] to encourage trade between Scottish ports (like Stirling) and these German cities.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Lübeck letter, 1297|url=http://www.scottisharchivesforschools.org/WarsOfIndependence/LubeckLetter.asp|website=Scottish Archives For Schools|publisher=National Records of Scotland|accessdate=3 April 2017}}</ref> There were also several [[Sieges of Stirling Castle]] in the conflict, notably in 1304.<ref>{{cite web|title=Stirling Castle Timeline|url=http://www.undiscoveredscotland.co.uk/stirling/stirlingcastle/timeline.html|website=Undiscovered Scotland|accessdate=8 April 2017}}</ref>

The railways did provide opportunity too with one Riverside company selling their reaping machines as far afield as [[Syria (region)|Syria]] and Australia. Similarly, in 1861, a company making baby carriages was set up. These prams were exported to Canada, South America, India and South Africa.<ref>{{cite web|title=Riverside Heritage Trail|url=http://www.stirling.gov.uk/__documents/temporary-uploads/employment,-community-_and_-youth/sht-2014/communitiesteam_shtriverside-boards.pdf#page=2|website=Stirling Council|accessdate=3 April 2017}}</ref>

After the blockades of the World Wars there was some increase in the use of the port including a tea trade with India. However, with normal shipping lanes open, the growth of the railways including The [[Forth Rail Bridge]], left the harbour uneconomical and by the mid 20th century the port had ceased to operate.

In terms of [[local government]], the city of Stirling is a part of the wider [[Stirling (council area)|Stirling Council area]], which governs on matters of local administration as set out by the [[Local Government etc (Scotland) Act 1994]]. The current members of the Council were voted in 2017 for a term of office of 5 years.

For the purposes of the [[Scottish Parliament]], the city of Stirling forms part of the [[Stirling (Scottish Parliament constituency)|Stirling constituency of the Scottish Parliament]] constituency. The Stirling Scottish Parliament (or ''Holyrood'') constituency created in 1999 is one of nine within the Mid Scotland and Fife electoral region. Each constituency elects one [[Member of the Scottish Parliament]] (MSP) by the first past the post system of election, and the region elects seven additional members to produce a form of proportional representation. The constituency is represented by [[Bruce Crawford]], [[Member of the Scottish Parliament|MSP]] of the [[Scottish National Party]].<ref name="Bruce Crawford MSP">{{cite web |url=http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/msp/memberspages/bruce_crawford_jp/index.htm |title=Bruce Crawford, MSP for Stirling |year=2010 |publisher=The Scottish Parliament |accessdate=5 February 2011}}</ref>

In terms of national government, the city of Stirling forms part of [[United Kingdom constituencies|county constituency]] of [[Stirling (UK Parliament constituency)|Stirling constituency of the House of Commons]], electing one [[Member of Parliament]] (MP) to the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] of the parliament of the United Kingdom by first past the post system.

==Geography==

[[File:Stirling Bridge and Wallace Monument.JPG|thumb|right|Stirling Bridge and the National Wallace Monument]]
Stirling is renowned as the ''Gateway to the Highlands'' and is generally regarded as occupying a strategic position at the point where the flatter, largely undulating Scottish Lowlands meet the rugged slopes of the [[Scottish Highlands|Highlands]] along the [[Highland Boundary Fault]].<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=crxqdevlel8C&pg=PA271|title=Scotland|last=Miers|first=Richenda|page=271|publisher=The Globe Pequot Press|year=2006|accessdate=30 January 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aynVaKQqJCgC&pg=PA213|title=Scotland|publisher=APA Publications|author=Josephine Buchanan|year=2003|page=213|accessdate=6 February 2011}}</ref> The starkness of this contrast is evidenced by the many hills and mountains of the lower Highlands such as [[Ben Vorlich (Loch Lomond)|Ben Vorlich]] and [[Ben Ledi]] which can be seen to the northwest of the city. On the other hand, the [[Carse|Carse of Stirling]], stretching to the west and east of the city, is one of the flattest and most agriculturally productive expanses of land in the whole of Scotland.

The land surrounding Stirling<ref>{{cite web|title=OS 10-mile Geological|url=http://maps.nls.uk/geo/explore/#zoom=11&lat=56.1181&lon=-3.9360&layers=10geol&b=1|website=National Library of Scotland|accessdate=3 April 2017}}</ref> has been most affected by [[glacial]] erosion and [[Deposition (sediment)|deposition]]. The city itself has grown up around its castle which stands atop an ancient [[quartz-dolerite]] [[Sill (geology)|sill]], known as the [[Stirling Sill]], a major defensive position which was at the lowest crossing point on the River Forth. Stirling stands on the Forth at the point where the river widens and becomes [[tidal]]. To the east of the city the [[Ochil Hills]] dominate the skyline with the highest peak in the range being [[Ben Cleuch]], although [[Dumyat]] is more noticeable from Stirling. The Ochils meet the flat [[carse]] ([[floodplain]]) of the River Forth to the east of the distinctive geographical feature of [[Abbey Craig]], a [[crag and tail]] hill upon which stands the 220&nbsp;ft (67m) high [[Wallace Monument|National Wallace Monument]].<ref>''Gazetteer for Scotland'' [http://www.scottish-places.info/features/featurefirst10406.html Abbey Craig]</ref>

The climate of Stirling differs little from that of much of the rest of central Scotland. The warm [[Gulf Stream]] air current from the Atlantic Ocean is the predominant influence, with a prevailing southwesterly wind.  That said, the areas round Stirling Town Centre encounter significantly less snow in Winter than many of its very close neighbours such as [[Denny, Falkirk|Denny]] and [[Dunblane]]. Although this could be said as being anecdotal, it is likely to be because it is at a lower level and could be said to have its own [[microclimate]].

==Areas of Stirling==

'''Top of the Town''' consists of Broad Street, Castle Wynd, Ballengeich Pass, Lower Castle Hill Road, Darnley Street, Baker Street ( formerly Baxters St), St John Street and St Mary's Wynd. These streets all lead up to Stirling Castle and are the favourite haunt of tourists who stop off at the Old Town Jail, [[Mar's Wark]],  [[Argyll's Lodging]] and the castle.  Ballengeich Pass leads to the graveyard at Ballengeich and the Castle Wynd winds past the old graveyard. The Top of the Town from Broad Street upwards is renowned for its cobblestoned roads, and cars can be heard rattling over the cobblestones on the way down. Craft shops and tourist-focused shops are evident on the way up and once at the top, panoramic views are available across Stirling and beyond.

==Economy==
{{refimprove section|date=January 2017}}

At the centre of a large rural agricultural hinterland that encompasses some of the flattest and most productive land in Scotland, Stirling principally functioned as a [[market town]], symbolised by its [[Mercat cross]], with farmers coming to sell their products and wares in the large agricultural market that was held in the town. Today, agriculture still plays a part in the economic life of Stirling, given its focus at the heart of a large rural area, but to a much lesser extent than previously.

With Stirling's development as a market town and its location as the focus of transport and communications in the region, it has developed a substantial [[retail]] sector serving a wide range of surrounding communities as well as the city itself. Primarily centred on the city centre, there are a large number of chain stores, as well as the [[Thistles Centre|Thistles]] [[Shopping mall|shopping centre]]. However this has been augmented by out-of-town developments such as the Springkerse Retail Park on the city bypass to the east of Stirling, and the development of a large [[Sainsbury's]] in [[Raploch|the Raploch]].

A major new [[Urban renewal|regeneration project]] on the site of the former port area and the {{convert|40|acre|m2|adj=on}} former Ministry of Defence site, adjacent to [[Stirling railway station, Scotland|Stirling Railway Station]], is currently underway.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.stirling.gov.uk/index/council/news.htm?id=33314 |title=Stirling Council: Council » Latest News |publisher=Stirling.gov.uk |date= |accessdate=14 July 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110926231727/http://www.stirling.gov.uk/index/council/news.htm?id=33314 |archive-date=26 September 2011 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}</ref> Known as Forthside, it has the aim of developing a new waterfront district linked to the railway station via a new pedestrian bridge. The development comprises retail, residential and commercial elements, including a conference centre, hotel and [[Vue (cinema)|Vue]] multiplex cinema, that will ultimately expand the city centre area, linking it to the River Forth, which has been cut off from the city centre area since the construction of the [[A9 road (Great Britain)|A9 bypass]] under the railway station in the 1960s.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.instirling.com/initve/intve.htm |title=InStirling report on Forthside project |publisher=Instirling.com |date= |accessdate=14 July 2010}}</ref> For the first time in 100 years, local people will have access to the banks of the River Forth in the city centre with landscaped public areas, footpaths, cycleways and an improved public transport network.
[[File:Wfm wallace monument.jpg|thumb|right|The 19th-century [[Wallace Monument]]]]
In the service sector, [[financial services]] as well as [[tourism]] are the biggest employers. The financial services and insurance company [[Prudential plc|Prudential]] have a large and well-established base at Craigforth on the outskirts of Stirling. In terms of tourism, the presence of such historical monuments as Stirling Castle, the [[National Wallace Monument]] and other nearby attractions like [[Blair Drummond Safari Park]], the key role which Stirling has played in [[History of Scotland|Scottish history]], as well as the scenery of the area, has bolstered Stirling's position as an important tourist destination in Scotland.

The [[University of Stirling]] and [[Stirling Council]] are two of the biggest employers in the area. Knowledge related industries, [[research and development]] as well as [[life sciences]] have clustered around the university in the Stirling University Innovation Park, close to its main campus. Other public sector agencies that are major employers in the city include [[Police Scotland]], [[Cornton Vale (HM Prison)|Scottish Prison Service]], [[NHS Forth Valley]] and the [[Scottish Environment Protection Agency]].

Mauchline ware started producing wooden snuff-boxes in 1790 in [[Mauchline]], Ayrshire. They were produced of the wood from the trees from the Castle craig. Today they are highly collectible.<ref>http://www.smithartgalleryandmuseum.co.uk/mauchline-ware/</ref>

Stirling is home to national construction companies Ogilvie Group, chaired by Duncan Ogilvie, who is listed in the Times Rich List as being worth £35 million.

A [[Bank of Scotland]] survey in 2009 found that workers in Stirling had the highest average earnings of £716 a week.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/north_east/8421193.stm |title=Aberdeenshire tops health and wealth living survey |work=BBC News |date=19 December 2009 |accessdate=14 July 2010}}</ref>

==Transport==
The City of Stirling is home to a large number of [[Commuting|commuters]] but has fewer commuting to work in other areas, than travel into the city. About half of Scotland's population live within an hour's travel time of Stirling.<ref>{{cite web|title=Stirling's Economic Strategy|url=http://www.stirling.gov.uk/__documents/chief-executive-office/chief-executive-office/strategic-planning/stirlings-economic-strategy-low.pdf#page=5|publisher=Stirling Council|accessdate=4 April 2017}}</ref>

'''Local bus services''' to districts within the city are almost completely provided by buses operated by [[First Scotland East]]. The surrounding towns, like [[Bridge of Allan]], [[Alloa]], [[Falkirk]] and [[Glasgow]] via [[Cumbernauld]] have services from the bus station.

'''Coaches''' to many [[List of towns and cities in Scotland by population|Scottish towns and cities]] also run regularly.<ref>{{cite web|title=Stirling Bus Station|url=http://my.stirling.gov.uk/services/transport-and-streets/public-and-community-transport/public-transport-information/transport-stations,-stops-and-shelters/stirling-bus-station|website=Stirling Council|accessdate=6 April 2017}}</ref>

There are also '''railway links''' from [[Stirling railway station, Scotland|Stirling railway station]], including [[inter-city rail]] services to [[Aberdeen railway station|Aberdeen]], [[Dundee railway station|Dundee]], [[Edinburgh Waverley railway station|Edinburgh Waverley]], [[Inverness railway station|Inverness]], [[Glasgow Queen Street railway station|Glasgow Queen Street]], and [[London King's Cross railway station|London King's Cross]]. Services to [[Alloa railway station|Alloa]], [[Bridge of Allan]], [[Falkirk]] and [[Dunblane railway station|Dunblane]] also run. Stirling Council provides some approximate journey times.<ref>{{cite web|title=Stirling Train Station and Services|url=http://my.stirling.gov.uk/services/transport-and-streets/public-and-community-transport/public-transport-information/transport-stations,-stops-and-shelters/stirling-train-station-and-services|website=Stirling Council|accessdate=6 April 2017}}</ref> Working lines include the [[Highland Main Line]], the [[Edinburgh–Dunblane line]] and the [[Croy Line]]. The station formerly provided direct railway services to [[Callander]] and [[Oban]], and to [[Loch Lomond]], over very scenic lines, and a fast service to [[Dunfermline]]. 

[[File:River Forth at Riverside, Stirling - geograph.org.uk - 1364754.jpg|thumb|right|Boats at Riverside, Stirling]]
Cities with '''motorways links''' close to Stirling include Glasgow, via the [[M80 motorway]] past Cumbernauld, and Edinburgh, via the [[M9 motorway (Scotland)|M9 motorway]] past Falkirk. To the north the M9 provides access to [[Dunblane]] with easy links to [[Perth]] and further beyond the [[Central Belt]].

Stirling has no '''airport''' but there are international airports at [[Glasgow Airport|Glasgow]] and [[Edinburgh Airport|Edinburgh]] which can be reached within an hour. Light aircraft can be chartered at [[Cumbernauld Airport]].

Stirling used to have steamboats which carried hundreds of passengers a day.<ref name="E. Mackay"/> There is currently no working '''port''' at Stirling but there are plans to develop the river<ref>{{cite web|title=City Deal Masterplan|url=http://my.stirling.gov.uk/files/citydealmasterplan.pdf#page=14|website=Stirling Council|accessdate=6 April 2017}}</ref> and the harbour<ref>{{cite news|last1=Jones|first1=Gareth Iwan|title=Talks set to begin as Stirling City Deal given the go-ahead by the Chancellor|url=http://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/local-news/talks-set-begin-stirling-city-9359271|accessdate=6 April 2017|publisher=Scottish Daily Record and Sunday Mail Ltd|date=29 November 2016}}</ref> which might include links with towns on the [[Firth of Forth]]. Since the [[River Forth|Forth]] is tidal at Stirling, development of [[Float (nautical)|pontoon]] style landing stages could potentially allow river taxis and tourist boats to operate during the summer.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Rowbotham |first1=John |title=Work starts on Stirling Council's £270,000 waterfront pontoon project |url=https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/local-news/work-starts-stirling-councils-270000-13016737 |accessdate=2 August 2018 |agency=Stirling Observer |date=1 August 2018}}</ref>

In 2017 [[Edinburgh to Glasgow Improvement Programme#Previous proposals|electification of the Stirling-Alloa-Dunblane]] railway is likely to lead to significant disruption of road traffic in Stirling which could last for some time.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Jones|first1=Gareth Iwan|title=Main road through Stirling set to be closed for a year for rail works|url=http://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/local-news/main-road-through-stirling-set-9611559|accessdate=6 April 2017|publisher=Scottish Daily Record and Sunday Mail Ltd|date=12 January 2017}}</ref>
