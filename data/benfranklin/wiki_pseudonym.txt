{{redirect|Aliases||Alias (disambiguation)}} 

A '''pseudonym''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|sj|uː|d|ən|ɪ|m}}) or '''alias''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|eɪ|l|i|ə|s}}) is a [[name]] that a person or group assumes for a particular purpose, which can differ from their first or true name ([[orthonym]]).<ref>Room (2010, 3).</ref>

Pseudonyms include [[stage name]]s and [[User (computing)|user names]], [[ring name]]s, [[pen name]]s, [[nickname]]s, aliases, [[superhero]] or [[villain]] identities and code names, gamer identifications, and [[regnal name]]s of [[emperors]], [[pope]]s, and other [[monarch]]s. Historically, they have often taken the form of [[anagram]]s, Graecisms, and [[Latinisation (literature)|Latinisations]], although there are many other methods of choosing a pseudonym.<ref>Peschke (2006, vii).</ref>

Pseudonyms should not be confused with new names that replace old ones and become the individual's full-time name. Pseudonyms are "part-time" names, used only in certain contexts – to provide a more clear-cut separation between one's private and professional lives, to showcase or enhance a particular persona, or to hide an individual's real identity, as with writers' [[pen name]]s, [[graffiti]] artists' tags, [[Resistance movement|resistance fighters']] or [[terrorist|terrorists']] ''noms de guerre'', and computer [[Hacker (computer security)|hackers]]' [[User (computing)|handles]]. [[Actor]]s, voice-over artists, musicians, and other performers sometimes use [[stage name]]s, for example, to better channel a relevant energy, gain a greater sense of security and comfort via privacy, more easily avoid troublesome fans/"stalkers", or to mask their ethnic backgrounds.

In some cases, pseudonyms are adopted because they are part of a cultural or organisational tradition: for example [[Religious name|devotional names]] used by members of some [[religious institute]]s, and "cadre names" used by [[Communist party]] leaders such as [[Leon Trotsky|Trotsky]] and [[Vladimir Lenin|Lenin]].

A pseudonym may also be used for personal reasons: for example, an individual may prefer to be called or known by a name that differs from their given or [[legal name]], but is not ready to take the numerous steps to get their name [[Name change|legally changed]]; or an individual may simply feel that the context and content of an exchange offer no reason, legal or otherwise, to provide their given or legal name.

A ''collective name'' or ''collective pseudonym'' is one shared by two or more persons, for example the co-authors of a work, such as [[Carolyn Keene]], [[Ellery Queen]], [[Nicolas Bourbaki]]. or [[James S. A. Corey]].

==Etymology==
The term is derived from the [[Greek language|Greek]] {{lang|el|ψευδώνυμον}} (''pseudṓnymon''), literally "false name", from {{lang|grc|ψεῦδος}} (''pseûdos''), "lie, falsehood"<ref>[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dyeu%3Ddos ψεῦδος],
Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', on Perseus project</ref> and {{lang|grc|ὄνομα}} (''ónoma''), "name".<ref>[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Do%29%2Fnoma ὄνομα], Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', on Perseus project</ref>

==Distinction from allonyms, ghost writers and pseudepigrapha==

A pseudonym is distinct from an ''allonym'', which is the (real) name of another person, assumed by the author of a work of art.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Turco|first1=Lewis|title=The Book of Literary Terms: The Genres of Fiction, Drama, Nonfiction, Literary Criticism, and Scholarship|date=1999|publisher=University Press of New England|location=Hanover and London|page=182|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=noTRMjASamEC&pg=PA182&dq=allonym&hl=de&sa=X&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q&f=false|accessdate=17 October 2017}}</ref> This may occur when someone is [[ghostwriting]] a book or play, or in [[parody]], or when using a "front" name, such as by [[screenwriter]]s [[Hollywood blacklist|blacklisted]] in [[Hollywood]] in the 1950s and 1960s. See also [[pseudepigraph]], for ''falsely'' attributed authorship.

==Usage==
===Legal name change===
Sometimes people change their name in such a manner that the new name becomes permanent and is used by all who know the person. This is not an alias or pseudonym, but in fact a new name. In many countries, including [[common law]] countries, a name change can be ratified by a court and become a person's new legal name.

For example, in the 1960s, black civil rights campaigner [[Malcolm X|Malcolm Little]] changed his surname to "X", to represent his unknown African ancestral name that had been lost when his ancestors were brought to North America as slaves. He then changed his name again to Malik El-Shabazz when he converted to Islam.{{Citation needed|date=July 2013}} Likewise some Jews adopted Hebrew family names upon immigrating to [[Israel]], dropping surnames that had been in their families for generations. The politician [[David Ben-Gurion]], for example, was born David Grün in Poland. He adopted his Hebrew name in 1910, when he published his first article in a Zionist journal in [[Jerusalem]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vision.org/visionmedia/biography-david-ben-gurion/5810.aspx|title= Biography David Ben-Gurion: For the Love of Zion|access-date=2017-06-01}}</ref> Many [[transgender]] people also choose to adopt a new name, typically around the time of their [[Transitioning (transgender)|social transitioning]], to resemble their desired gender better than their birth name.

===Concealing identity===
====Business====
Businesspersons of ethnic minorities in some parts of the world are sometimes advised by an employer to use a pseudonym that is common or acceptable in that area when conducting business, to overcome [[racial bias|racial]] or religious [[Bias#Prejudices|bias]].<ref>Robertson, Nan, ''The Girls in the Balcony: Women, Men, and ''The New York Times (N.Y.: Random House, [2nd printing?] 1992 ({{ISBN|0-394-58452-X}})), p. 221. In 1968, one such employer was [[The New York Times]], the affected workers were classified-advertising takers, and the renaming was away from [[Jews|Jewish]], [[Irish people|Irish]], and [[Italian people|Italian]] names to ones "with a [[White Anglo-Saxon Protestant|WASP]] flavor".</ref>

====Criminal activity====
Criminals may use aliases, [[fictitious business names]], and [[dummy corporations]] ([[corporate shells]]) to hide their identity, or to impersonate other persons or entities in order to commit fraud. Aliases and fictitious business names used for dummy corporations may become so complex that, in the words of the ''[[Washington Post]]'', "getting to the truth requires a walk down a bizarre labyrinth" and multiple government agencies may become involved to uncover the truth.<ref name=RTR>The Ruse That Roared, ''The Washington Post'', 5 November 1995, Richard Leiby, James Lileks</ref>

====Literature====
[[File:Die junge George Sand.jpg|thumb|right|180px|A young [[George Sand]] (real name "Amantine Lucile Dupin")]]

A [[pen name]], or ''"nom de plume"'' (French for "pen name"), is a pseudonym (sometimes a particular form of the real name) adopted by an [[author]] (or on the author's behalf by their publishers).

Some female authors used male pen names, in particular in the 19th century, when writing was a male-dominated profession. The [[Brontë family]] used pen names for their early work, so as not to reveal their gender (see below) and so that local residents would not know that the books related to people of the neighbourhood. The Brontës used their neighbours as inspiration for characters in many of their books. Anne Brontë published ''The Tenant of Wildfell Hall'' under the name Acton Bell. Charlotte Brontë published ''Shirley'' and ''Jane Eyre'' under the name Currer Bell. Emily Brontë published ''Wuthering Heights'' as Ellis Bell.
A well-known example of the former is Mary Ann Evans, who wrote as [[George Eliot]]. Another example is Amandine Aurore Lucile Dupin, a 19th-century French writer who used the pen name [[George Sand]].

In contrast, some twentieth and twenty first century male romance novelists have used female pen names.<ref name=maleauthors>{{cite news|last=Naughton|first=Julie|title=Yes, Virgil, There Are Men Writing Romance: Focus on Romance 2012|url=http://www.publishersweekly.com/pw/by-topic/new-titles/adult-announcements/article/52473-yes-virgil-there-are-men-writing-romance-focus-on-romance-2012.html|accessdate=6 May 2014|newspaper=Publishers Weekly|date=1 June 2012}}</ref> A few examples of male authors using female pseudonyms include Brindle Chase, [[Peter O'Donnell]] (wrote as Madeline Brent) and [[Christopher Wood (writer)|Christopher Wood]] (wrote as Penny Sutton and Rosie Dixon).<ref name="maleauthors" />

A pen name may be used if a writer's real name is likely to be confused with the name of another writer or notable individual, or if their real name is deemed to be unsuitable.

Authors who write both fiction and non-fiction, or in different [[genres]], may use different pen names to avoid confusing their readers.

In some cases, an author may become better known by his pen name than his real name.
One famous example of this is Samuel Clemens writing under the pen name [[Mark Twain]]. British [[mathematician]] Charles Dodgson, who wrote fantasy novels under the pen name [[Lewis Carroll]] and mathematical treatises under his own name, refused to open letters addressed to him as "Lewis Carroll".

Some authors, such as [[Harold Robbins]], use several literary pseudonyms.<ref>[http://www.trussel.com/books/pseud_r.htm Rubin, Harold Francis (1916–)], Author Pseudonyms: R. Accessed 27 November 2009.</ref>

Some pen names have been used for long periods, even decades, without the author's true identity being discovered, such as [[Elena Ferrante]] and [[Torsten Krol]].

Some pen names are not strictly pseudonyms, as they are simply variants of the authors' actual names. The authors [[C. L. Moore]] and [[S. E. Hinton]] were female authors who used the initialised forms of their full names. [[C. L. Moore]] was Catherine Lucille Moore, who wrote in the 1930s male-dominated science fiction genre, and [[S. E. Hinton]], (author of ''[[The Outsiders (novel)|The Outsiders]]'') is Susan Eloise Hinton. ''[[Star Trek]]'' writer [[D. C. Fontana]] (Dorothy Catherine) wrote using her abbreviated own name and also under the pen names Michael Richards and J. Michael Bingham. Author [[V.C. Andrews]] intended to publish under her given name of Virginia Andrews, but was told that, due to a production error, her first novel was being released under the name of "V.C. Andrews"; later she learned that her publisher had in fact done this deliberately. Joanne Kathleen Rowling<ref>{{cite web| url= http://www.levesoninquiry.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/Witness-Statement-of-JK-Rowling2.pdf|title=Witness statement of Joanne Kathleen Rowling| publisher= The [[Leveson Inquiry]]|date=November 2011|accessdate=25 November 2011}}</ref> published the ''[[Harry Potter]]'' series under the shortened name [[J. K. Rowling]].<!-- See article for further explanation, keep it simple here --> Rowling also published the [[Cormoran Strike]] series, a series of detective novels including ''[[The Cuckoo's Calling]]'' under the pseudonym "Robert Galbraith".

[[Winston Churchill]] wrote under the pen name [[Winston Churchill as writer|Winston S. Churchill]] (from his full surname "Spencer-Churchill" which he did not otherwise use) in an attempt to avoid confusion with the [[Winston Churchill (novelist)|American novelist of the same name]]. In this case, the attempt was not entirely successful – and the two are still sometimes confused by booksellers.<ref>{{cite web|last=The Age 19 October 1940, hosted on Google News|title=Two Winston Churchills|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1300&dat=19401019&id=QJZVAAAAIBAJ&sjid=PpcDAAAAIBAJ&pg=4893,3645349|accessdate=25 October 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=My Early Life – 1874–1904, hosted on Google Books |title=Oldham |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=n2EK2khQWfsC&pg=PA218&lpg=PA218&dq=%22mr.+winston+churchill+makes+haste+to+add%22#v=onepage&q=%22mr.%20winston%20churchill%20makes%20haste%20to%20add%22&f=false |accessdate=25 October 2013}}</ref>

A pen name may be used specifically to hide the identity of the author, as in the case of [[Exposé (journalism)|exposé]] books about [[espionage]] or [[crime]], or explicit erotic fiction. Some prolific authors adopt a pseudonym to disguise the extent of their published output, e.g. [[Stephen King]] writing as [[Richard Bachman]]. Co-authors may choose to publish under a collective pseudonym, e.g., [[P. J. Tracy]] and [[Perri O'Shaughnessy]]. [[Frederic Dannay]] and [[Manfred Lee]] used the name [[Ellery Queen]] as both a pen name for their collaborative works and as the name of their main character.

A famous case in French literature was [[Romain Gary]]. Already a well-known and highly acclaimed writer, he started publishing books under the pen name [[Émile Ajar]]. He wanted to test whether his new books would be well received on their own merits and without the aid of his established reputation, and they were: Émile Ajar, like Romain Gary before him, was awarded the prestigious [[Prix Goncourt]] by a jury unaware that both were the same person. Similarly, [[Ronnie Barker]] submitted comedy material under the name of Gerald Wiley.

A collective pseudonym may represent an entire publishing house, or any contributor to a long-running series, especially with juvenile literature. Examples include [[Watty Piper]], [[Victor Appleton]], [[Erin Hunter]], and Kamiru M. Xhan.

Another use of a pseudonym in literature is to present a story as being written by the fictional characters in the story. The series of novels known as ''[[A Series Of Unfortunate Events]]'' are written by [[Daniel Handler]] under the pen name of [[Lemony Snicket]], a character in the series.

An '''anonymity pseudonym''' or [[multiple-use name]] is a name used by many different people to protect anonymity.<ref Name="Home">{{cite book

This has led to the idea of the "open pop star".

====Medicine====
Pseudonyms and [[acronym]]s are often employed in [[medical research]] to [[Privacy for research participants|protect subjects' identities]] through a process known as [[de-identification]].

===={{anchor|Noms de guerre}}Military and paramilitary organizations====<!-- [[Noms de guerre]], [[Nom de guerre]] and [[Nom-de-guerre]] redirect here -->
{{Refimprove section|date=September 2016}}

In [[Ancien Régime]] France, a ''nom de guerre'' ("war name") would be adopted by each new recruit (or assigned to them by the captain of their company) as they enlisted in the [[French army]]. These pseudonyms had an official character and were the predecessor of [[Dog tag|identification numbers]]: soldiers were identified by their first names, their family names, and their ''noms de guerre'' (e.g. ''Jean Amarault dit Lafidélité''). These pseudonyms were usually related to the soldier's place of origin (e.g. ''Jean Deslandes dit Champigny'', for a soldier coming from a town named [[Champigny (disambiguation)|Champigny]]), or to a particular physical or personal trait (e.g. ''Antoine Bonnet dit Prettaboire'', for a soldier ''prêt à boire'', ready to drink). In 1716, a ''nom de guerre'' was mandatory for every soldier; officers did not adopt ''noms de guerre'' as they considered them derogatory. In daily life, these aliases could replace the real family name.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.histori.ca/prodev/article.do?id=15333 |title=Home &#124; Historica – Dominion |publisher=Historica |date= |accessdate=14 October 2012}}</ref>

''Noms de guerre'' were adopted for security reasons by members of the [[World War II]] [[French resistance]] and [[Polish underground state|Polish resistance]]. Such pseudonyms are often adopted by military special forces soldiers, such as members of the SAS and other similar units, [[Resistance movement|resistance fighters]], [[terrorism|terrorists]], and [[guerrilla warfare|guerrillas]]. This practice hides their identities and may protect their families from reprisals; it may also be a form of [[wikt:dissociation|dissociation]] from domestic life. Some well-known men who adopted ''noms de guerre'' include Carlos, for [[Ilich Ramírez Sánchez]]; [[Willy Brandt]], [[Chancellor of Germany (Federal Republic)|Chancellor]] of [[West Germany]]; and [[Subcomandante Marcos]], the spokesman of the [[Zapatista Army of National Liberation]] (EZLN). {{Citation needed|date=July 2008}} During [[Lehi (group)|Lehi]]'s underground fight against the British in [[Mandatory Palestine]], the organization's commander [[Yitzchak Shamir]] (later [[Prime Minister of Israel]]) adopted the ''nom de guerre'' "Michael", in honour of [[Ireland]]'s [[Michael Collins (Irish leader)|Michael Collins]].

Revolutionaries and resistance leaders, such as [[Vladimir Lenin|Lenin]], [[Leon Trotsky|Trotsky]], [[Golda Meir]], [[Philippe Leclerc de Hauteclocque]], and [[Josip Broz Tito]], often adopted their ''noms de guerre'' as their proper names after the struggle. [[George Grivas]], the Greek-Cypriot [[EOKA]] militant, adopted the ''nom de guerre'' Digenis (Διγενής). In the [[French Foreign Legion]], recruits can adopt a pseudonym to break with their past lives. Mercenaries have long used "noms de guerre", even sometimes multiple identities depending on country, conflict and circumstance.{{Citation needed|date=January 2015}} Some of the most familiar noms de guerre today are the [[Kunya (Arabic)|kunya]] used by Islamic [[mujahideen]]. These take the form of a [[teknonym]], either literal or figurative.

====Online activity====
Individuals using a computer [[online]] may adopt or be required to use a form of pseudonym known as a "handle" (a term deriving from [[CB slang]]), "[[User (computing)|user]] name", "[[Logging (computer security)|login]] name", "[[Avatar (virtual reality)|avatar]]", or, sometimes, "[[Screen name (computing)|screen name]]", "[[gamertag]]" "IGN ('''I'''n '''G'''ame ('''N'''ick)'''N'''ame)" or "[[nickname]]". On the Internet, [[pseudonymous remailer]]s use [[cryptography]] that achieves persistent [[pseudonymity]], so that two-way communication can be achieved, and reputations can be established, without linking physical [[identity theft|identities]] to their respective pseudonyms. [[Aliasing (computing)|Aliasing]] is the use of multiple names for the same data location.

More sophisticated cryptographic systems, such as anonymous [[digital credential]]s, enable users to communicate pseudonymously (i.e., by identifying themselves by means of pseudonyms). In well-defined abuse cases, a designated authority may be able to revoke the pseudonyms and reveal the individuals' real identity.{{Citation needed|date=June 2013}}

Use of pseudonyms is common among professional [[eSports]] players, despite the fact that many professional games are played on [[LAN]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ongamers.com/articles/why-esports-needs-to-ditch-online-aliases/1100-205/|title=Why esports needs to ditch online aliases|first=Taylor |last=Cocke |date=26 November 2013|accessdate=14 May 2015}}</ref>

====Privacy====
People seeking privacy often use pseudonyms to make appointments and reservations.<ref>{{cite web|first1=Harriet |last1=Ryan |first2=Kimi |last2=Yoshino |url=http://www.latimes.com/news/local/la-me-jackson17-2009jul17,0,3782664.story |title=Investigators target Michael Jackson's pseudonyms |publisher=Latimes.com |date=17 July 2009 |accessdate=14 October 2012}}</ref> Those writing to [[advice column]]s in newspapers and magazines may use pseudonyms.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://news.google.co.uk/newspapers?nid=4TOpqqG69KYC&dat=18830407&printsec=frontpage |title=''Toronto Daily Mail, "Women's Kingdom", "A Delicate Question", April 7, 1883, page 5 |publisher=News.google.co.uk |date= |accessdate=14 October 2012}}</ref> [[Steve Wozniak]] used a pseudonym when attending the [[University of California, Berkeley]] after cofounding [[Apple Computer]] because, he said, "I knew I wouldn't have time enough to be an A+ student."<ref name="stix19860514">{{cite news | url=http://articles.latimes.com/print/1986-05-14/news/vw-5389_1_steve-wozniak | title=A UC Berkeley Degree Is Now the Apple of Steve Wozniak's Eye | work=Los Angeles Times | date=14 May 1986 | accessdate=5 January 2015 | author=Stix, Harriet}}</ref>

===Stage names===
{{main|Stage name}}
When used by an [[actor]], [[musician]], radio [[disc jockey]], [[model (person)|model]], or other performer or "[[show business]]" personality a pseudonym is called a ''stage name'', or, occasionally, a ''professional name'', or ''screen name''.

====Film, theatre, and related activities====
Members of a marginalized ethnic or religious group have often adopted stage names, typically changing their surname or entire name to mask their original background.

Stage names are also used to create a more marketable name, as in the case of Creighton Tull Chaney, who adopted the pseudonym [[Lon Chaney, Jr.]], a reference to his famous father [[Lon Chaney, Sr.]]

[[Chris Curtis]] of [[Deep Purple]] fame was christened as Christopher Crummey. In this and similar cases a stage name is adopted simply to avoid an unfortunate [[pun]].

Pseudonyms are also used to comply with the rules of [[performing arts]] [[guild]]s ([[Screen Actors Guild]] (SAG), [[Writers Guild of America, East]] (WGA), [[AFTRA]], etc.), which do not allow performers to use an existing name, in order to avoid confusion. For example, these rules required film and television actor Michael Fox to add a middle initial and become [[Michael J. Fox]], to avoid being confused with another actor named [[Michael Fox (American actor)|Michael Fox]]. This was also true of author and actress [[Fannie Flagg]], who chose this pseudonym; her real name, Patricia Neal, being the name of [[Patricia Neal|another well-known actress]]; and British actor [[Stewart Granger]], whose real name was James Stewart. The film-making team of [[Coen brothers|Joel and Ethan Coen]], for instance, share credit for editing under the alias Roderick Jaynes.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://nymag.com/daily/entertainment/2008/01/roderick_jaynes_imaginary_osca.html |title=Roderick Jaynes, Imaginary Oscar Nominee for ‘No Country’ – Vulture |publisher=Nymag.com |date= |accessdate=14 October 2012}}</ref> Another example is that actor [[Gary Morgan (actor)|Gary Morgan]] used his fictional name "Barnard Panansky" in the [[Kidsongs]]' I'd Like to Teach the World to Sing video while in Kidsongs: Very Silly Songs, his actual name appears in the credits.{{cn|date=September 2018}}

Some stage names are used to conceal a person's identity, such as the pseudonym [[Alan Smithee]], which was used by directors in the [[Directors Guild of America]] (DGA) to remove their name from a film they feel was edited or modified beyond their artistic satisfaction. In theatre, the pseudonyms [[George Spelvin|George or Georgina Spelvin]], and [[Walter Plinge]] are used to hide the identity of a performer, usually when he or she is "doubling" (playing more than one role in the same play).

[[David Agnew]] was a name used by the [[BBC]] to conceal the identity of a scriptwriter, such as for the [[Doctor Who]] serial [[City of Death]], which had 3 writers, including [[Douglas Adams]], who was at the time of writing the show's Script Editor.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/doctorwho/classic/episodeguide/cityofdeath/detail.shtml|title=BBC – Doctor Who Classic Episode Guide – City of Death – Details|work=bbc.co.uk|accessdate=18 July 2015}}</ref> In another Doctor Who serial, [[The Brain of Morbius]], writer [[Terrance Dicks]] demanded the removal of his name from the credits saying it could go out under a "bland pseudonym".{{citation needed|date=December 2018}}<ref name="codenames"/> This ended up being the name ''Robin Bland''.<ref name="codenames">{{cite web|first=William |last=Gallagher |url=http://www.radiotimes.com/news/2012-03-27/doctor-whos-secret-history-of-codenames-revealed |title=Doctor Who's secret history of codenames revealed |work=[[Radio Times]] |date=27 March 2012 |accessdate=31 March 2013 |deadurl=unfit |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150227211038/http://www.radiotimes.com/news/2012-03-27/doctor-whos-secret-history-of-codenames-revealed |archivedate=27 February 2015 }}</ref><ref>Howe, Walker and Stammers ''Doctor Who the Handbook: The Fourth Doctor'' pp 175–176</ref>

====Music====
{{sources|section|date=September 2018}}
Musicians and singers can use pseudonyms to allow artists to collaborate with artists on other labels while avoiding the need to gain permission from their own labels, such as the artist [[Jerry Samuels]], who made songs under Napoleon XIV. Rock singer-guitarist [[George Harrison]], for example, played guitar on [[Cream (band)|Cream]]'s song "[[Badge (song)|Badge]]" using a pseudonym.<ref name="John Wynn">{{cite book|last=Winn|first=John|year=2009 | title = That Magic Feeling: The Beatles' Recorded Legacy, Volume Two, 1966–1970 |publisher=Three Rivers Press |isbn=978-0-307-45239-9|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LdsMqbAQJWgC&dq |page=229}}</ref> In classical music, some record companies issued recordings under a ''nom de disque'' in the 1950s and 1960s to avoid paying royalties. A number of popular budget LPs of piano music were released under the pseudonym [[Paul Procopolis]].{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}} Another example is that [[Paul McCartney]] used his fictional name "Bernerd Webb" for [[Peter and Gordon]]'s song [[Woman (Paul McCartney song)|Woman]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.45cat.com/record/5579|title=45cat - Peter And Gordon - Woman / Wrong From The Start - Capitol - USA - 5579 |publisher=45cat |accessdate=30 June 2018}}</ref>

Pseudonyms are also used as stage names in [[Heavy metal music|heavy metal]] bands, such as [[Tracii Guns]] in [[LA Guns]], [[Axl Rose]] and [[Slash (musician)|Slash]] in [[Guns N' Roses]], [[Mick Mars]] in [[Mötley Crüe]], [[Dimebag Darrell]] in [[Pantera]], or [[C.C. Deville]] in [[Poison (American band)|Poison]]. Some of these names have additional meanings, like that of Brian Hugh Warner, more commonly known as [[Marilyn Manson]]: Marilyn coming from [[Marilyn Monroe]] and Manson from convicted serial killer [[Charles Manson]]. [[Jacoby Shaddix]] of [[Papa Roach]] went under the name "Coby Dick" during the ''[[Infest (album)|Infest]]'' era. He changed back to his birth name when ''[[lovehatetragedy]]'' was released.

[[David Johansen]], frontman for the hard rock band [[New York Dolls]],  recorded and performed pop and lounge music under the pseudonym Buster Poindexter in the late 1980s and early 1990s. The music video for Poindexter's debt single, [[Hot Hot Hot (Arrow song)#Buster Poindexter version|Hot Hot Hot]], opens with a monologue from Johansen where he notes his time with the New York Dolls and explains his desire to create more sophisticated music. 

[[Ross Bagdasarian, Sr.]], creator of [[Alvin and the Chipmunks]], wrote original songs, arranged, and produced the records under his real name, but performed on them as [[David Seville]].  He also wrote songs using the name Skipper Adams.  Danish pop pianist [[Bent Fabric]], whose full name is Bent Fabricius-Bjerre, wrote his biggest instrumental hit "[[Alley Cat (song)|Alley Cat]]" under the name Frank Bjorn.

For a time, the musician [[Prince (musician)|Prince]] used an unpronounceable "[[Prince (musician)#Stage names|Love Symbol]]" as a pseudonym ("Prince" is his actual first name rather than a stage name). He wrote the song "[[Sugar Walls]]" for [[Sheena Easton]] under the alias "Alexander Nevermind" and "[[Manic Monday]]" for [[The Bangles]] as "Christopher Tracy" (he also produced albums early in his career as "Jamie Starr").

Many Italian-American singers have used stage names as their birth names were difficult to pronounce, or considered too ethnic for American tastes.  Singers changing their names included [[Dean Martin]] (born Dino Paul Crocetti), [[Connie Francis]] (born Concetta Franconero), [[Frankie Valli]] (born Francesco Castelluccio), [[Tony Bennett]] (born Anthony Benedetto), and [[Lady Gaga]] (born Stefani Germanotta)

In 2009, British rock band [[Feeder (band)|Feeder]] briefly changed their name to [[Renegades (band)|Renegades]] so they could play a whole show featuring a setlist in which 95 percent of the songs played were from their forthcoming new album of the same name, with none of their singles included. Frontman [[Grant Nicholas]] felt that if they played as Feeder, there would be an uproar that they did not play any of the singles, so used the pseudonym as a hint. A series of small shows were played in 2010, at 250- to 1,000-capacity venues with the plan not to say who the band really are and just announce the shows as if they were a new band.

In many cases, hip-hop and rap artist prefer to use pseudonyms that represents some variation of their name, personality, or interests.
