'''John Trumbull''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|t|r|ʌ|m|b|əl}}; June 6, 1756{{snd}}November 10, 1843) was an American artist during the period of the [[American Revolutionary War]] and was notable for his [[historical painting]]s. He has been called '''The Painter of the Revolution'''.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Johnston|first1=Elizabeth Bryant|title=Original Portraits of Washington, including Statues, Monuments and Medals |chapter=John Trumbull|date=1882|page=66|url=https://archive.org/stream/originalportrait00john#page/66/mode/1up|oclc=3303313}}</ref> 

Trumbull's ''[[Declaration of Independence (Trumbull)|Declaration of Independence]]'' (1817), one of his four paintings which hang in the [[United States Capitol Rotunda]], was used on the reverse of the commemorative bicentennial [[United States two-dollar bill|two-dollar bill]].

==Early life==
Trumbull was born in [[Lebanon, Connecticut]], in 1756, to [[Jonathan Trumbull]] and his wife Faith (née Robinson) Trumbull. His father served as [[Governor of Connecticut]] from 1769 to 1784. Both sides of his family were descended from early Puritan settlers in the state.

He had two older brothers, [[Joseph Trumbull (commissary general)|Joseph Trumbull]], the first commissary general of the [[Continental Army]] in the Revolutionary War, and [[Jonathan Trumbull Jr.]], who would become the second Speaker of the House of the United States. 

The young Trumbull entered the 1771 junior class at [[Harvard College]] at age fifteen and graduated in 1773. Due to a childhood accident, Trumbull lost use of one eye, which may have influenced his detailed painting style.<ref name=time1956>{{Cite magazine |title=Gentleman John Trumbull |magazine=Time Magazine |date=1956-10-29 |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,867213,00.html |accessdate=2008-02-17 |postscript=<!--None-->}}</ref>

==Revolutionary War==
As a soldier in the [[American Revolutionary War]], Trumbull rendered a particular service at [[Boston]] by sketching plans of the British [[Fortification|works]]. He witnessed the [[Battle of Bunker Hill]]. He was appointed second [[personal aide]] to General [[George Washington]], and in June 1776, deputy adjutant-general to General [[Horatio Gates]].<ref name="EB1911">{{EB1911|inline=y|wstitle=Trumbull, John (artist)|display=Trumbull, John|volume=27|page=324}}</ref> He resigned from the army in 1777 after a dispute over the dating of his officer commission.

In 1780, with funds depleted, Trumbull turned to art as a profession. He traveled to [[London]], where upon introduction from [[Benjamin Franklin]], Trumbull studied under [[Benjamin West]]. At West's suggestion, Trumbull painted small pictures of the War of Independence and [[Portrait miniature|miniature portraits]]. He painted about 250 in his lifetime.{{sfnp|Trumbull|1841|pp=288–94}}

On September 23, 1780, British agent Major [[John André]] was captured by Continental troops in North America; he was hanged as a spy on October 2, 1780. After news reached Great Britain, outrage flared and Trumbull was arrested, as having been an officer in the Continental Army of similar rank to André.<ref name="EB1911"/> He was imprisoned for seven months in London's [[Tothill Fields Bridewell]].{{sfnp|Jaffe|1975|p=50}}<ref>{{cite web|last1=Heleniak|first1=Kathryn Moore|title=Benjamin West and John Trumbull|url=http://www.library.fordham.edu/trumbull/benjamin.html|publisher=[[Fordham University]]|access-date=2017-11-19|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160320033737/http://www.library.fordham.edu/trumbull/benjamin.html|archive-date=2016-03-20|dead-url=yes|df=}}</ref>

After being released, Trumbull returned to the United States in a voyage that lasted six months, ending late January 1782. He then joined his brother David in supplying the [[New Windsor Cantonment|army stationed]] at [[New Windsor, New York]] during the winter of 1782–83.{{sfnp|Jaffe|1975|pp=53–54}}{{sfnp|Trumbull|1841|p=88}}

==Postwar years==
[[File:John Trumbull Gilbert Stuart 1818.jpeg|thumb|right|upright|''John Trumbull'', painted by [[Gilbert Stuart]], 1818]]
In 1784, following the British recognition of the [[United States]]' independence, Trumbull returned to London for painting study under West. While working in his studio, Trumbull painted ''Battle of Bunker Hill'' and ''Death of General Montgomery in the Attack on Quebec.'' Both works are now in the [[Yale University Art Gallery]].

In July 1786, Trumbull went to [[Paris]], where he made portrait sketches of French officers for the ''[[Surrender of Lord Cornwallis]].'' With the assistance of [[Thomas Jefferson]], serving there as the [[United States Ambassador to France|American minister to France]], Trumbull began the early composition of the ''[[Declaration of Independence (Trumbull)|Declaration of Independence]]''.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Adams |first1=William Howard |title=The Paris Years of Thomas Jefferson |date=2000 |isbn=978-0-30008-261-6 |pages=90–2 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wUYTAOwDMP8C&pg=PA90}}</ref>{{sfnp|Trumbull|1841|pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=jPI1AAAAMAAJ&pg=PA95 95–6]}}<ref name="EB1911"/> Over the next 5 years Trumbull painted small portraits of signers, which he would later use to piece together the larger painting. If the signer was deceased, a previous portrait would be copied, as was the case with [[Arthur Middleton]], whose head position stands out in the painting. While visiting with each signer or their family, Trumbull, always looking for funding, used the occasion to sell subscriptions to engravings that would be produced from his paintings of the American Revolution.{{sfnp|Trumbull|1841|pp=288–94}}

While in Paris, Trumbull is credited with having introduced Jefferson to the [[Italy|Italian]] painter [[Maria Cosway]]; they became lifelong intimate friends. Trumbull's painting of Jefferson, commissioned by Cosway, became widely known due to a later engraving of it by [[Asher Brown Durand]], which was reproduced.

Trumbull's ''Declaration of Independence'' painting was purchased by the [[United States Congress]], along with his ''[[Surrender of General Burgoyne]]'', ''Surrender of Lord Cornwallis'', and ''[[General George Washington Resigning His Commission]]'', all related to the Revolution.  All now hang in [[United States Capitol rotunda|rotunda]] of the [[United States Capitol]]. Congress reportedly authorized only funds sufficient to purchase these four paintings.<!-- as compared to what? or rather than? -->

Trumbull completed several other paintings related to the Revolution: 
*''[[The Death of General Warren at the Battle of Bunker's Hill, June 17, 1775|Death of General Warren at the Battle of Bunker's Hill]]'' (one version is held by the Boston Museum of Fine Arts); 
*''[[The Death of General Montgomery in the Attack on Quebec, December 31, 1775|Death of General Montgomery in the Attack on Quebec]]''; 
*''[[The Capture of the Hessians at Trenton, December 26, 1776|Capture of the Hessians at Trenton]]''; 
*''[[The Death of General Mercer at the Battle of Princeton, January 3, 1777|Death of General Mercer at the Battle of Princeton]]''; and  
*''[[The Sortie Made by the Garrison of Gibraltar, 1789]]''. This was once owned by the [[Boston Athenaeum]] and  is now held by the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] in New York City.<ref name="EB1911"/>

==Middle years==
[[File:General George Washington at Trenton by John Trumbull.jpeg|thumb|upright|''[[General George Washington at Trenton]]'', oil on canvas, 1792. [[Yale University Art Gallery]].]]
Trumbull encountered hard times in which he was failing to sell his paintings individually; in 1831 he sold a series of 28&nbsp;paintings and 60&nbsp;miniature portraits to [[Yale University]] for an [[Annuity (US financial products)|annuity]] of $1,000. After many years of trying to create income from his painting, he had finally found a way to sustain himself from his art.{{sfnp|Trumbull|1841|pp=288–94}} This is by far the largest single collection of his works. The collection was originally housed in a [[Neoclassicism|neoclassical]] art gallery designed by Trumbull on Yale's [[Old Campus]], along with portraits by other artists.<ref>{{cite web|title=Yale University Art Gallery: Architecture|url=http://artgallery.yale.edu/about/architecture}} Trumbull Gallery (1832)</ref>

His portraits also include full lengths of [[George Washington (Trumbull, 1790, New York City Hall)|General Washington]] (1790) and [[George Clinton (vice president)|George Clinton]] (1791), now held in [[New York City Hall]].<ref name="EB1911"/> New York also bought his full-length paintings of [[Alexander Hamilton]] (1805, the source of the face on the [[United States ten-dollar bill|$10&nbsp;bill]]<ref>{{cite news | last=Dunlap | first=David W. | title=In New York, Taking Years Off the Old, Famous Faces Adorning City Hall | publisher=The New York Times | date=2006-12-06 | accessdate=2007-01-07 | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/12/06/nyregion/06portraits.html?ref=nyregion }}</ref>) and [[John Jay]]. In 1791 Trumbull was elected a Fellow of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]].<ref name=AAAS>{{cite web|title=Book of Members, 1780–2010: Chapter T|url=http://www.amacad.org/publications/BookofMembers/ChapterT.pdf|publisher=American Academy of Arts and Sciences|accessdate=August 7, 2014}}</ref>

He painted portraits of [[John Adams]] (1797), Jonathan Trumbull, and [[Rufus King]] (1800); [[Timothy Dwight IV|Timothy Dwight]] and [[Stephen Van Rensselaer III|Stephen Van Rensselaer]] (both at Yale), [[Alexander Hamilton]] (one in the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] and one in the [[Boston Museum of Fine Arts]], both taken from [[Alexander Hamilton (Ceracchi)|Ceracchi's bust]]), a self-portrait (1833), a full-length of Washington, held at [[Charleston, South Carolina]]; a full-length of Washington in uniform, ''[[General George Washington at Trenton]]'', (1792, at Yale); and portraits of President and [[Martha Washington|Mrs. Washington]] (1794), in the [[National Museum of American History]].<ref name="EB1911"/>

Trumbull was painted by [[Gilbert Stuart]] and many others.

In 1794 Trumbull acted as secretary to [[John Jay]] in London during the negotiation of the treaty with Great Britain, which largely settled the boundary with Canada and began cotton export.<!-- The US had been exporting cotton before this, surely --> In 1796 he was appointed by the commissioners sent by the two countries as the fifth member of a commission charged with carrying out the seventh article of the [[Jay Treaty]],<ref name="EB1911"/> which mediated claims by American and British merchants and the opposing government stemming from actions which occurred during the war. Shortly after the end of Trumbull's service on this commission, he traveled to Stuttgart to pick up the completed engraving of the ''Battle of Bunker's Hill''. On the return trip he passed through Paris and carried the first dispatch from the [[XYZ Affair]] out of France.{{sfnp|Jaffe|1975|pp=177–82}}

==Later years==

[[File:John Trumbull James Frothingham.jpg|thumb|right|upright|John Trumbull, painted by [[James Frothingham]]]]Trumbull was appointed president of the [[American Academy of the Fine Arts]] in New York City, serving for twenty years, from 1816 to 1836.{{sfnp|Jaffe|1975|pp=264–75}} Emphasizing classical traditions, Trumbull did not get along with the students. At the same time, his painting skills declined. In 1825 many of the students withdrew, founding the [[National Academy of Design]].<ref>{{Cite book |title=A History of the Rise and Progress of the Arts of Design in the United States (Vol 3) |last=Dunlap |first=William |year=1918 |pages=52–57 |publisher =C. E. Goodspeed & Co. |url=https://books.google.com/?id=0FJLAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA52|accessdate=2008-02-17}}</ref> Unable to accommodate to changing tastes, the American Academy later closed in 1839 after a second fire destroyed its collections.

Trumbull wrote his autobiography, which he published in 1841. He died in New York City at the age of 87 on November 10, 1843.

*Trumbull was originally interred (along with his wife) beneath the Art Gallery at [[Yale University]], which he had designed. In 1867, the collection of his works were moved to the newly built [[Street Hall]]. His and his wife's remains were reinterred on those grounds.<ref>[http://www.yalealumnimagazine.com/issues/01_03/popup/landmarks/7.html Trumbull Gallery at Yale] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070305090705/http://www.yalealumnimagazine.com/issues/01_03/popup/landmarks/7.html |date=2007-03-05 }}</ref> The Trumbull Gallery was later razed.

Trumbull's painting ''The Declaration of Independence'' is mentioned in the opening track of ''[[The Hamilton Mixtape]]'' recorded by [[The Roots]] based on work by [[Lin-Manuel Miranda]] called "No John Trumbull – Intro."<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/usher-sia-jimmy-fallon-lead-hamilton-mixtape-track-list-w448454|title=Usher, Sia, Jimmy Fallon Lead 'Hamilton Mixtape' Track List|work=Rolling Stone|access-date=2017-04-29}}</ref> The song plays on the fact that the Founding Fathers look as if standing patiently in a line, saying that "the reality is messier and richer."<ref>{{Citation|title=Lin-Manuel Miranda (Ft.
