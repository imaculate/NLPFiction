The '''Governor of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania''' is the head of the [[executive branch]] of [[Government of Pennsylvania|Pennsylvania's state government]]<ref>PA Constitution article IV, § 2</ref> and serves as the [[commander-in-chief]] of the [[U.S. state|state's]] [[Pennsylvania National Guard|military forces]].<ref>PA Constitution article IV, § 7</ref>

The [[Governor (United States)|governor]] has a duty to enforce state laws, and the power to approve or [[veto]] [[bill (proposed law)|bills]] passed by the [[Pennsylvania Legislature]]<ref>PA Constitution article IV, § 15</ref> and to convene the legislature.<ref>PA Constitution article IV, § 12</ref> The governor may grant pardons except in cases of [[impeachment]], but only when recommended by the Board of Pardons.<ref>PA Constitution article IV, § 9</ref>

There have been seven presidents and 46 governors of Pennsylvania, with two governors serving non-consecutive terms, totaling 55 terms in both offices. The longest term was that of the first governor, [[Thomas Mifflin]], who served three full terms as governor in addition to two years as president. The shortest term belonged to [[John C. Bell, Jr.|John Bell]], who served only 19 days as acting governor after his predecessor resigned. The current governor is [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]] [[Tom Wolf]], whose term began on January 20, 2015.

==Governors==
Pennsylvania was one of the original [[thirteen colonies]], and was admitted as a state on December 12, 1787. Prior to declaring its independence, Pennsylvania was a [[Province of Pennsylvania|colony]] of the [[Kingdom of Great Britain]]; see the list of [[List of colonial governors of Pennsylvania|colonial governors]] for the pre-statehood period.

===Presidents of the Supreme Executive Council===
The first [[Pennsylvania Constitution of 1776|Pennsylvania constitution in 1776]] created the [[Supreme Executive Council]] as the state's executive branch, with the [[President of Pennsylvania|President of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania]] as its head.<ref>1776 Constitution § 3</ref> The president was chosen annually by the council, though with no specific term dates.<ref>1776 Constitution § 19</ref>

The original 1776 constitution created the position of "vice-president", though no provision was made if the office of president became vacant, which occurred four times later. Contemporary sources continue to label the chief executive in such times as the vice president, without any notion of succeeding to the presidency. One acting president, [[George Bryan]], was subsequently recognized later as a full-fledged governor, due to his acting as president for over six months.

===Governors of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania===
[[File:Five PA-Governors.jpg|thumb|right|Five governors of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania who  have served since 1995, (left to right): [[Mark Schweiker]], [[Tom Ridge]], [[Tom Wolf]], [[Tom Corbett]] and [[Ed Rendell]] (January 2015), pose in front of the south facade of the [[Pennsylvania State Capitol]] on the [[Susquehanna River]] front in [[Harrisburg, Pennsylvania|Harrisburg]] at a gubernatorial inauguration]]

The 1790 constitution abolished the council and replaced the president with a governor,<ref>1790 Constitution article II, § 1</ref> and established a three-year term for governor commencing on the third Tuesday of the December following the election, with governors not allowed to serve more than nine out of any twelve years.<ref>1790 Constitution article IV, § 3</ref> The 1838 constitution moved the start of the term to the third Tuesday of the January following the election, and allowed governors to only serve six out of any nine years.<ref>1838 Constitution article II, § 3</ref> The 1874 constitution lengthened the term to four years, and prohibited governors from succeeding themselves.<ref>1874 Constitution article IV, § 3</ref> The current constitution of 1968 changed this to allow governors to serve two consecutive terms.<ref>PA Constitution article IV, § 3</ref> There are no limits on the number of terms a governor may serve in total as long as there is a four-year break after a second term.

Under the earlier  1968 constitution, [[Milton Shapp]] was the first governor to serve 2 terms, and [[Tom Corbett]] was the first incumbent governor to lose a re-election bid.

If the office of governor becomes vacant through death, resignation, or conviction on impeachment, the [[Lieutenant Governor of Pennsylvania|lieutenant governor]] becomes governor for the remainder of the term; if the office is only temporarily vacant due to disability of the governor, the lieutenant governor only acts out the duties of governor.<ref>PA Constitution article IV, § 13</ref> Should both offices be vacant, the [[president pro tempore|president ''"pro tempore"'']] of the state senate becomes governor.<ref>PA Constitution article IV, § 14</ref> The position of a lieutenant  governor was created in the 1874 constitution; prior to then, the speaker of the senate would act as governor in cases of vacancy. Originally, the lieutenant governor could only act as governor; it was not until the 1968 constitution that the lieutenant governor could actually become the sitting governor in that fashion. The office of governor has been vacant for an extended period once before, a 17-day gap in 1848 between the resignation of the previous governor and the swearing in of his acting successor. Governors and lieutenant governors are elected on the same [[political party]] [[ticket (election)|ticket]].<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.thegreenpapers.com/slg/executive.phtml | title=Executive Branch of the Several States | publisher=The Green Papers | accessdate=April 30, 2008}}</ref>

==The Governor's Residence==
{{see also|Pennsylvania Governor's Residence}}

See Also [https://web.archive.org/web/20150924070714/http://www.pennsylvaniapoliticals.com/governors-residence.html Governor's Residence via Pennsylvania Politicals]

From [http://www.pennsylvaniapoliticals.com Pennsylvania Politicals]: Pennsylvania has never used the name "mansion" to describe the governor's official home. Even when the first bill was proposed to purchase a home, the word mansion was not used. Rather, the home was and is designated as a "residence." Even during the 79 years that [https://web.archive.org/web/20150924070721/http://www.pennsylvaniapoliticals.com/keystone-hall.html Keystone Hall] was used, it was known simply as that, Keystone Hall. Even today, the home located at 2035 North Front Street  is officially known as "The Governor's Residence" not "The Governor's Mansion." The distinction may be both psychological and historical. It may help to remind the governor that he lives in the people's house. It may also remind the electorate that the we, as citizens, own the home and allow the individuals we choose to reside there only temporarily.

As early as 1852, the Pennsylvania House of Representatives proposed funds for "the erection of a dwelling for the residence of the Governor of this Commonwealth." Six years later, on January 18, 1858, Governor Pollock signed the bill authorizing funds for the purchase of a building suitable for the governor. By 1861 and the start of the Civil War, Governor Curtin found the home to be too small to handle the full load of war-related business. Funds were authorized to purchase 313 North Front Street. Governor Curtin and family moved into the residence in 1864.

Twenty years later, the neighboring home was purchased, joined together, and a faux façade was built. Keystone Hall was now a fully functioning residence for the governor. By 1959, the home had fallen into such disrepair that the home was sold and demolished the following year. (The governors used the State House at Indiantown Gap during this period.) [[Arthur James (politician)|Arthur James]] proposed a new governors residence in 1941. He wanted a grand house built in the William & Mary (Williamsburg) style architecture. However, it took over 25 years for his idea to come to fruition. In 1968, the current residence opened to welcome the Ray Shafer family. It has been the home of the governor ever since.

==Living former U.S. governors of Pennsylvania==
{{As of|2018|1}}, there are five former U.S. governors of Pennsylvania who are currently living at this time, the oldest U.S. governor of Pennsylvania being [[Dick Thornburgh]] (served 1979–1987, born 1932). The most recent death of a former U.S. governor of Pennsylvania was that of [[William Scranton]] (served 1963–1967, born 1917), on July 28, 2013. The most recently serving U.S. governor of Pennsylvania to die was [[Bob Casey Sr.]], (served 1987–1995) on May 30, 2000.
