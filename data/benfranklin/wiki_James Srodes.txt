==Career==
His most recent biography is ''Spies in Palestine: Love, Betrayal and the Heroic Life of Sarah Aaronsohn'' published by Counterpoint Press in 2016. The book is the story of [[Sarah Aaronsohn]] and her prominent family, early settlers of Palestine who formed the [[NILI]] espionage network to spy for the Allies against the Ottoman Turkish Empire during World War One.<ref>Goulden, Joseph C.. “[http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/nov/27/book-review-spies-in-palestine-love-betrayal-and-t/ Book Review: Spies in Palestine: Love, Betrayal and the Heroic Life of Sarah Aaronsohn],” ''Washington Times'', November 27, 2016.</ref> The book is a story of lost opportunities. ''The Times of Israel'' quotes Srodes as saying, “There was a brief window at the turn of the 20th century where Jews and Arabs had a common alliance of sorts that could have been built on, because they had a common enemy in the Ottoman Turks. But the fact that it didn’t turn out that way is a real tragedy.” <ref>O’Malley, JP. “[http://www.timesofisrael.com/with-spy-sarah-aaronsohns-suicide-israeli-history-was-rewritten-claims-author/ With Spy Sarah Aaronsohn’s Suicide, Israeli History was Rewritten, Claims Author],” ''Times of Israel'', December 14, 2006.</ref> According to ''Booklist'', “In this engaging story of the woman called the Flame of Israel, a woman greatly admired by the fabled Lawrence of Arabia, Srodes also details the lost opportunity for a peaceful alliance between the new Israel and the indigenous people of the region.”<ref>Bush, Vanessa. “Review of Spies in Palestine,” ''Booklist'', September 15, 2016.</ref>

Srodes' previous book is a multiple-biography titled ''On Dupont Circle: Franklin and Eleanor Roosevelt and the Progressives Who Shaped Our World'' that was published by Counterpoint Press in 2013. The book, which was a finalist for the ''Los Angeles Times'' history book award and also was nominated for a Pulitzer Prize, portrays a group of reform-minded strivers in Washington, D.C. between World War I and World War II. This group included [[Herbert Hoover]], [[William Christian Bullitt, Jr.|William Bullitt]], [[Felix Frankfurter]], [[Walter Lippmann]], [[Sumner Welles]], [[John Foster Dulles]], [[Allen Dulles]], [[Eleanor Lansing Dulles]], [[Eleanor Roosevelt]] and [[Franklin Roosevelt]]. According to the ''Washington Independent Review of Books'', “James Srodes deftly portrays their colorful stories. He also makes the bold argument that the 'set,' as he calls them, profoundly influenced U.S. policies for much of the 20th century.”<ref>[http://www.washingtonindependentreviewofbooks.com/bookreview/on-dupont-circle-franklin-and-eleanor-roosevelt-and-the-progressives-who-sh Barrett, Laurence I.,“On Dupont Circle: Franklin and Eleanor Roosevelt and the Progressives Who Shaped Our World,”] ''Washington Independent Review of Books'', August 17, 2012</ref> According to a review in ''Publishers Weekly'', “Srodes is refreshingly unafraid to question his subjects' motives.”<ref>[http://www.publishersweekly.com/978-1-58243-716-3 “On Dupont Circle: Franklin and Eleanor Roosevelt and the Progressives Who Shaped Our World,”] ''Publishers Weekly'', December 10, 2012.</ref>

Srodes is also the author of ''Franklin: The Essential Founding Father.''

As part of that effort, Srodes appeared at a series of book talks and seminars at local library branches, schools and area colleges during a four-month period.<ref>[http://libwww.library.phila.gov/OneBook/obop06/calendar.pdf “One Book, One Philadelphia Author Events,”] web site of the Free Library of Philadelphia, retrieved October 29, 2015.</ref>  ''Franklin: The Essential Founding Father'' was also translated into simplified Chinese and published in China by Guang-dong People's Publishing House (GDPPH), a division of Beijing Shi Zu Niao Culture Communication Co.<ref>[https://www.amazon.cn/dp/B077V932BR ''Franklin: The Essential Founding Father'' (Chinese Edition)] by James Srodes, Web site of Amazon.cn, retrieved November 8, 2018.</ref>
