==History==
[[Congress of the United States|Congress]] designated the [[national memorial]] on October 25, 1972 (Public Law 92-551).  Unlike most national memorials, the statue is not listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]].  The national memorial is an affiliated area of the [[National Park Service]], assigned to [[Independence National Historical Park]] through a Memorandum of Agreement entered into on November 6, 1973.  Under terms of the agreement, the Institute owns and maintains the publicly accessible memorial, and the Park Service includes the memorial in official publications and otherwise cooperates with the Institute in all appropriate and mutually agreeable ways on behalf of the memorial.

Public Law 109-153 (December 30, 2005) authorizes the [[United States Secretary of the Interior|Secretary of the Interior]] to make available to the Institute up to $10,000,000 in matching grants for the rehabilitation of the memorial and for the development of related exhibits.  This appropriation commemorates the 300th anniversary of Franklin's birth on January 17, 1706.<ref>[http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/getdoc.cgi?dbname=109_cong_public_laws&docid=f:publ153.109 Public Law 109-153]</ref>

In 2008, the Memorial underwent a $3.8-million restoration, which included installation of a multi-media presentation about Philadelphia's most famous citizen, now featured in the 3Â½-minute show "Benjamin Franklin Forever". The memorial's new digital projection, theatrical lighting, and audio effects are fully utilized in a program that introduces Franklin as a curious tinkerer, and demonstrates his profound impact on the world as a premiere international citizen, statesman, civic leader, and scientist. The refurbishment also included improved acoustics, state-of-the-art LED lighting upgrades, and restoration and re-gilding of the oculus to its original brilliance. Throughout the day, quotes from Franklin are projected onto the walls, and graphic panels highlighting his life and accomplishments provide visitors with a still greater appreciation of this Founding Father.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pewtrusts.org/news_room_detail.aspx?id%3D38186 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-02-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110703142323/http://www.pewtrusts.org/news_room_detail.aspx?id=38186 |archivedate=2011-07-03 |df= }}</ref>
