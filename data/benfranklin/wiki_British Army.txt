{{British Army}}

The '''British Army''' is the principal [[Army|land warfare force]] of the [[United Kingdom]], a part of [[British Armed Forces]]. {{as of|2018}}, the British Army comprises just over 81,500 trained regular (full-time) personnel and just over 27,000 trained [[Army Reserve (United Kingdom)|reserve (part-time)]] personnel.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/681512/201801_-_SPS.pdf|title=UK Armed Forces Monthly Personnel Report – Jan 2018|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref>

The modern British Army traces back to 1707, with an antecedent in the [[English Army]] that was created during the [[Restoration (England)|Restoration]] in 1660.

[[File:General Thomas Fairfax (1612-1671) by Robert Walker and studio.jpg|thumb|Lord General Thomas Fairfax, the first commander of the New Model Army]]

Until the [[English Civil War]], England never had a [[standing army]] with professional officers and careerist corporals and sergeants.  It relied on militia organized by local officials, or private forces mobilized by the nobility, or on hired mercenaries from Europe.<ref>David G. Chandler, ed., ''The Oxford history of the British army'' (1996) pp 24–45.</ref> From the later Middle Ages until the English Civil War, when a foreign expeditionary force was needed, such as the one that [[Henry V of England]] took to France and that fought at the [[Battle of Agincourt]] (1415), the army, a professional one, was raised for the duration of the expedition.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blog.nationalarchives.gov.uk/blog/victorious-army-making-raising-king-henry-vs-army-1415/|title=A victorious army in the making: Raising King Henry V's army of 1415|date=11 August 2015 | first=Benjamin |last=Trowbridge |publisher=National Archives|accessdate=17 October 2017}}</ref>

During the English Civil War, the members of the [[Long Parliament]] realised that the use of county militia organised into regional associations (such as the [[Eastern Association]]), often commanded by local members of parliament (both from the House of Commons and the House of Lords), while more than able to hold their own in the regions which Parliamentarians controlled, were unlikely to win the war. So Parliament initiated two actions. The [[Self-denying Ordinance]], with the notable exception of [[Oliver Cromwell]], forbade members of parliament from serving as officers in the Parliamentary armies. This created a distinction between the civilians in Parliament, who tended to be Presbyterian and conciliatory to the Royalists in nature, and a corps of professional officers, who tended to Independent politics, to whom they reported. The second action was legislation for the creation of a Parliamentary-funded army, commanded by Lord General [[Thomas Fairfax]], which became known as the [[New Model Army]] (originally new-modelled Army).{{sfn|Rogers|1968|pp=207–211}}

While this proved to be a war winning formula, the New Model Army, being organized and politically active, went on to dominate the politics of the [[Interregnum (England)|Interregnum]] and by 1660 was widely disliked. The New Model Army was paid off and disbanded at the [[Restoration (1660)|Restoration]] of the monarchy in 1660. For many decades the excesses of the New Model Army under [[the Protectorate]] of Oliver Cromwell was a horror story and the Whig element recoiled from allowing a standing army.<ref>Lord Macaulay ''The History of England from the accession of James the Second'' (C.H. Firth ed. 1913) 1:136-38</ref>  The militia acts of 1661 and 1662 prevented local authorities from calling up militia and oppressing their own local opponents. Calling up the militia was possible only if the king and local elites agreed to do so.<ref>{{cite web|title= 'Charles II, 1661: An Act declaring the sole Right of the Militia to be in King and for the present ordering & disposing the same.', Statutes of the Realm: volume 5: 1628–80 (1819), |pages=308–309|url= http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.asp?compid=47290|accessdate= 5 March 2007}}</ref>

After the Restoration Charles II pulled together four regiments of infantry and cavalry, calling them his guards, at a cost of £122,000 from his general budget. This became the foundation of the permanent English Army. By 1685 it had grown to 7,500 soldiers in marching regiments, and 1,400 men permanently stationed in garrisons.  A [[Monmouth Rebellion|rebellion]] in 1685 allowed [[James II of England|James II]] to raise the forces to 20,000 men.  There were 37,000 in 1678, when England played a role in the closing stage of the Franco-Dutch War.  After [[William III of England|William]] and [[Mary II of England|Mary's]] accession to the throne England involved itself in the [[War of the Grand Alliance]], primarily to prevent a French invasion restoring James II (Mary's father).<ref>{{harvnb|Miller|2000|p=144}}</ref>  In 1689, William III expanded the army to 74,000, and then to 94,000 in 1694.  Parliament was very nervous, and reduced the cadre to 7000 in 1697.  Scotland and Ireland had theoretically separate military establishments, but they were unofficially merged with the English force.<ref>Chandler, ed., ''The Oxford history of the British army'' (1996) pp 46–57.</ref><ref>Correlli Barnett, ''Britain and her army, 1509–1970: a military, political and social survey'' (1970) pp 90–98, 110–25.</ref>

By the time of the 1707 [[Acts of Union 1707|Acts of Union]], many regiments of the English and Scottish armies were combined under one operational command and stationed in the Netherlands for the [[War of the Spanish Succession]]. Although all the regiments were now part of the new British military establishment,<ref name=Chandler2003>{{cite book|last1=Chandler|first1=David|title=The Oxford history of the British Army|date=2003|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-280311-5|page=xv|url=https://books.google.com/?id=ZOgs8WpJI9AC&pg=PA45&dq=british+army+founded+1660#v=snippet&q=British%20army%20from%20the%20Act%20of%20Union|quote=It is generally accepted that the regular standing army in Britain was officially created – in the sense of being fully accommodated within parliamentary control in 1689, although it is, strictly speaking, only correct to refer to the British army from the Act of Union with Scotland in 1707.}}</ref> they remained under the old operational-command structure and retained much of the institutional ethos, customs and traditions of the standing armies created shortly after the [[restoration (England)|restoration of the monarchy]] 47 years earlier. The order of seniority of the most-senior British Army line regiments is based on that of the English army. Although technically the Scots [[Royal Regiment of Foot]] was raised in 1633 and is the oldest Regiment of the Line,<ref>{{cite web|title=History|url=http://www.army.mod.uk/infantry/23301.aspx|publisher=British Army|accessdate=12 January 2017}}</ref> Scottish and Irish regiments were only allowed to take a rank in the English army on the date of their arrival in England (or the date when they were first placed on the English establishment). In 1694, a board of general officers was convened to decide the rank of English, Irish and Scots regiments serving in the Netherlands; the regiment which became known as the [[Scots Greys]] were designated the 4th Dragoons because there were three English regiments raised prior to 1688, when the Scots Greys were first placed in the English establishment. In 1713, when a new board of general officers was convened to decide the rank of several regiments, the seniority of the Scots Greys was reassessed and based on their June 1685 entry into England. At that time there was only one English regiment of dragoons, and the Scots Greys eventually received the British Army rank of 2nd Dragoons.{{sfn|Royal Scots Greys|1840|pp=56–57}}

=== British Empire (1700–1914) ===
{{main|British Army during the Napoleonic Wars|British Army during the Victorian Era}}

After 1700 British continental policy was to contain expansion by competing powers such as France and Spain. Although Spain was the dominant global power during the previous two centuries and the chief threat to England's early transatlantic ambitions, its influence was now waning. The territorial ambitions of the French, however, led to the War of the Spanish Succession<ref>{{harvnb|Mallinson|2009|p=50}}</ref> and the [[Napoleonic Wars]].<ref name=ma165/>

Although the [[Royal Navy]] is widely regarded as vital to the rise of the [[British Empire]], the British Army played an important role in the formation of colonies, [[protectorate]]s and [[dominion]]s in the Americas, Africa, Asia, India and [[Australasia]].<ref>{{harvnb|Mallinson|2009|p=104}}.</ref> British soldiers captured strategically-important territories, and the army was involved in wars to secure the empire's borders and support friendly governments.

The British Army was heavily involved in the [[Napoleonic Wars]], participating in a number of campaigns in Europe (including continuous deployment in the [[Peninsular War]]), the [[Caribbean]], North Africa and [[War of 1812|North America]]. The war between the British and the [[First French Empire]] of [[Napoleon Bonaparte]] stretched around the world; at its peak in 1813, the regular army contained over 250,000 men. A coalition of Anglo-Dutch and Prussian armies under the [[Duke of Wellington]] and [[Field Marshal von Blücher]] finally defeated Napoleon at [[Battle of Waterloo|Waterloo]] in 1815.<ref>{{harvnb|Mallinson|2009|p=177}}.</ref>

The English were involved politically and militarily in Ireland since receiving the [[Lordship of Ireland]] from the pope in 1171. The campaign of English republican Protector [[Oliver Cromwell]] involved uncompromising treatment of the Irish towns (most notably [[Drogheda]] and [[Wexford]]) which supported the Royalists during the [[English Civil War]]. The English Army (and the subsequent British Army) remained in Ireland primarily to suppress Irish revolts or disorder.  In addition to its conflict with Irish nationalists, it was faced with the prospect of battling Anglo-Irish and [[Ulster-Scots|Ulster Scots]] in Ireland who were angered by unfavourable taxation of Irish produce imported into Britain. With other Irish groups, they raised a volunteer army and threatened to emulate the American colonists if their conditions were not met. Learning from their experience in America, the British government sought a political solution. The British Army fought Irish rebels—Protestant and Catholic—primarily in [[Ulster]] and [[Leinster]] ([[Theobald Wolfe Tone|Wolfe Tone's]] [[United Irishmen]]) in the [[Irish Rebellion of 1798|1798 rebellion]].<ref>[http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/british/empire_seapower/irish_reb_01.shtml The 1798 Irish Rebellion] BBC</ref>

Great Britain has been challenged by other powers, primarily the [[German Empire]] and the [[Third Reich]] during the 20th century. A century earlier it vied with Napoleonic France for global pre-eminence, and [[House of Hanover|Hannoverian]] Britain's natural allies were the kingdoms and principalities of [[northern Germany]]. By the middle of the 19th century, Britain and France were allies in preventing Russia's appropriation of the [[Ottoman Empire]] (although the fear of French invasion led shortly afterwards to the creation of the Volunteer Force. By the first decade of the 20th century, the United Kingdom was allied with France (by the [[Entente Cordiale]]) and Russia (which had a secret agreement with France for mutual support in a war against the [[Prussia]]n-led German Empire and the [[Austro-Hungarian Empire]]).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://wwi.lib.byu.edu/index.php/The_Anglo-Russian_Entente |title=Agreement concerning Persia|accessdate=23 July 2016}}</ref>

World War I was the most devastating in [[Military history of the United Kingdom|British military history]], with nearly 800,000 men killed and over two&nbsp;million wounded.

{{main|List of equipment of the British Army}}

==== Infantry ====
The British Army's basic infantry weapon is the [[SA80|L85A2]] or [[SA80|L85A3]] assault rifle, sometimes equipped with an [[L17A2 UGL|L17A2]] under-barrel grenade launcher or other attachments with the [[Picatinny rail]]. The rifle has several variants, including the [[L86 LSW|L86A2]], the Light Support Weapon (LSW) and the L22A2 carbine (issued to tank crews). These weapons are usually equipped with [[iron sights]] or an optical [[SUSAT]], although optical sights have been purchased to supplement these.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.army.mod.uk/equipment/23222.aspx|title=The British Army – SA80 individual weapon|website=www.army.mod.uk|language=en|access-date=9 February 2017}}</ref>

Support fire is provided by the [[FN Minimi]] light machine gun and the [[L7 (machine gun)|L7 general-purpose machine gun]] (GPMG),<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.army.mod.uk/equipment/23226.aspx|title=The British Army – General purpose machine gun|website=www.army.mod.uk|language=en|access-date=9 March 2017}}</ref> and indirect fire is provided by [[L16 81mm mortar]]s.

==== Protected mobility ====
Where armour is not required or mobility and speed are favoured the British Army utilises protected patrol vehicles, such as the Panther variant of the [[Iveco LMV]], the [[Ocelot (vehicle)|Foxhound]], and variants of the [[Cougar (vehicle)|Cougar]] family (such as the Ridgeback, Husky and Mastiff).<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.army.mod.uk/equipment/23235.aspx|title=The British Army – Protected patrol vehicles|website=www.army.mod.uk|language=en|access-date=9 March 2017}}</ref> For day-to-day utility work the army commonly uses the [[Land Rover Wolf]], which is based on the [[Land Rover Defender]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.landrover.com/gb/en/lr/defender/|title=Land Rover Defender|date=|publisher=Landrover.com|accessdate=28 March 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110405215951/http://www.landrover.com/gb/en/lr/defender/|archivedate=5 April 2011|df=dmy-all}}</ref>

== {{anchor|Formation and structure}}Structure ==
{{British Army Arms}}
{{Main|Structure of the British Army}}

[[Army Headquarters (United Kingdom)|Army Headquarters]] is located in [[Andover, Hampshire]]. The army's structure is broadly similar to the [[Royal Navy]] and [[Royal Air Force]], in that the four-star (general-equivalent) field commands have been eliminated. Under the Army 2020 Command structure, the [[Chief of the General Staff (United Kingdom)|Chief of the General Staff]] is in charge of Army Headquarters. There are four lieutenant-general posts in Army headquarters: the [[Deputy Chief of the General Staff (United Kingdom)|Deputy Chief of the General Staff]], the [[Commander Field Army]], the Commander [[Home Command (British Army)|Home Command]] and the Commander [[Allied Rapid Reaction Corps]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/482984/20151201-FOI201510480_76137_CFA_Restructure_ArmySec.pdf|title=Freedom of Information Act answer from Army Headquarters|publisher=Army Headquarters|accessdate=13 December 2015}}</ref> Army Headquarters is responsible for providing forces at operational readiness for employment by the [[Permanent Joint Headquarters]].<ref name=":3" />

The command structure is hierarchical, with [[Division (military)|divisions]] and [[brigade]]s controlling groups of units. Major units are [[regiment]]/[[battalion]]-sized, and minor units are [[Company (military unit)|company]]-sized units (or [[platoons]]). All units are Regular (full-time) or [[Army Reserve (United Kingdom)|Army Reserve]] (part-time).<ref name=":3" />

Naming conventions of units differ for historical reasons, creating some confusion; the term "battalion" in the infantry is synonymous with a cavalry, artillery or engineer regiment, and the infantry "company" is synonymous with an engineer or cavalry squadron and an artillery battery. The table below illustrates the different names for equivalent units.<ref name="SAS" />

|}
Adding to the confusion is the tendency of units (again for historical reasons) to misuse titles for larger administrative structures. Although the [[Royal Artillery]] consists of 13 Regular regiments (equivalent to infantry battalions), it calls itself the Royal Regiment of Artillery when referring to the units as a whole. The [[Royal Logistic Corps]] and [[Intelligence Corps (United Kingdom)|Intelligence Corps]] are not [[corps]]-sized, but corps in this instance are administrative branches consisting of several battalions or regiments.<ref name=":3" />

=== Operational structure ===
{{See also|Administrative structure of the field forces of the British Army}}

The field forces of the British Army after the [[Army 2020]] reforms are organised in garrison as:
* Reaction forces: A modified [[16 Air Assault Brigade]] and an armoured division ([[3rd Division (United Kingdom)|3rd Division]]) of three armoured infantry brigades (1st, 12th and 20th Armoured Infantry Brigades). In 2020, this division will reorganise and consist of two armoured infantry brigades and two strike brigades.<ref name=":4">{{Cite web|url=http://www.army.mod.uk/structure/33449.aspx|title=The British Army – Army 2020 Refine|website=www.army.mod.uk|language=en|access-date=9 March 2017|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170126104357/http://www.army.mod.uk/structure/33449.aspx|archivedate=26 January 2017|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref name=":5">{{Cite web|url=https://www.parliament.uk/business/publications/written-questions-answers-statements/written-statement/Commons/2016-12-15/HCWS367/|title=Strategic Defence and Security Review – Army:Written statement – HCWS367|website=UK Parliament|language=en|access-date=9 March 2017 }}</ref>
* Adaptive forces: The [[1st (United Kingdom) Division|1st Division]], consisting of seven infantry brigades. In 2020, the adaptive force will consist of specialised infantry battalions who will train, advise, assist, mentor and accompany operations by indigenous forces.<ref name=":4" /><ref name=":5" />
* Force Troops Command: Nine brigades of supporting units which supplement the reaction and adaptive forces.<ref name=":5" />

[[File:The combined might of the 1 Yorkshire Regiment Battle group on display MOD 45158837.jpg|thumb|upright=2|alt=Large group of tanks|Challenger 2, Warrior, AS90, [[Multiple rocket launcher|MLRS]] and Stormer of the [[Yorkshire Regiment|Yorkshire Battlegroup]]]]

For operational tasks the most common unit is the [[Battlegroup (army)|battlegroup]], formed around a combat unit and supported by units (or sub-units) from other areas. An example of a battlegroup in the Reactive Force (e.g. the 1st Brigade) would be two companies of armoured infantry (e.g. from the 1st Battalion of the Mercian Regiment), one squadron of heavy armour (e.g. A Squadron of the Royal Tank Regiment), a company of engineers (e.g. B Company of the 22nd Engineer Regiment), a battery of artillery (e.g. D Battery of the 1st Regiment of the Royal Horse Artillery) and smaller attachments from medical, logistic and intelligence units. Typically organised and commanded by a battlegroup headquarters and named after the unit which provided the most combat units, in this example it would be the 1 Mercian Battlegroup). This creates a self-sustaining mixed formation of armour, infantry, artillery, engineers and support units, typically 600 to 1,000 soldiers commanded by a lieutenant colonel.<ref name="SAS" />

The table below demonstrates how three or four battlegroups make up a [[brigade]] and three or four brigades make up a [[Division (military)|division.]]  A division is currently the largest unit the British Army is capable of deploying independently, although it could be grouped with three or four other divisions from a multi-national coalition to form a [[corps]].<ref name="SAS">{{cite web | title = British Army Formation & Structure | publisher = WhoDaresWins.com | year = 2011 | url = http://www.whodareswins.com/british-army-formation-structure-setup.html | accessdate = 15 April 2011}}

[[File:1945 Order of Precedence of the British Army.jpg|thumb|1945 Order of Precedence of the British Army]]
The British Army historically included many units from what are now separate [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] ''realms''. When the [[English Empire]] was established in North America, Bermuda, and the West Indies in the early Seventeenth Century there was no standing English Army, only the Militia, and this was extended to the colonies. Colonial Militias defended colonies single-handedly at first against Indigenous peoples and European competitors. Once the standing English Army, later the British Army, came into existence, the colonial Militias fought side-by-side with it in a number of wars, including the [[Seven Years' War]]. Some of the colonial Militias rebelled during the [[American Revolutionary War|American War of Independence]]. Militia fought alongside the regular British Army (and Native allies) in defending British North America from their former countrymen during the [[War of 1812|American War of 1812]]. With the growth of the Empire around the world, ''Non-European'' (i.e., non-white, except for officers) units were recruited in many colonies and [[protectorate]]s, but most were deemed auxiliaries and not part of the British Army. The [[West India Regiment]]s were an exception, as they were fully incorporated into the British Army, but were kept outside of Europe and non-whites were denied commissions. Locally raised units in strategically-located colonies (including Bermuda, Gibraltar, Malta) and the Channel Islands were generally more fully integrated into the British Army as evident from their appearances in British Army Lists, unlike units such as [[King's African Rifles]]. The larger colonies (Australia, New Zealand, Canada, South Africa, et cet.) mostly achieved [[Dominion|Commonwealth Dominion]] status before or after the First World War and were granted granted full legislative independence in 1931. While remaining within the British Empire, this placed their governments on a par with the British Government, and hence their military units comprised separate armies (e.g. the [[Australian Army]]), although Canada retained the term Militia for its military forces until the Second World War. From the 1940s, these Dominions and many colonies chose full independence, usually becoming [[Commonwealth realm]]s (as member states of the Commonwealth are known today).<ref>{{cite web | title=Statute of Westminster Adoption Act 1942 | work=National Archives of Australia: Documenting a Democracy | url = http://www.foundingdocs.gov.au/item.asp?sdID=96 | accessdate=8 August 2005 | deadurl=yes |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20050716075624/http://www.foundingdocs.gov.au/item.asp?sdID=96 |archivedate=16 July 2005 | df=dmy-all }}</ref><ref>{{citation |url = https://ottawacitizen.com/opinion/op-ed/Succeeding+Canadian+throne/7651371/story.html|last=Bowden |first=James | first2=Philippe |last2=Lagassé | title=Succeeding to the Canadian throne | date=6 December 2012 |newspaper=Ottawa Citizen | accessdate=6 December 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20130110062651/http://www.ottawacitizen.com/opinion/op-ed/Succeeding%2BCanadian%2Bthrone/7651371/story.html |archivedate=10 January 2013 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>

Although the army primarily recruits within the United Kingdom, it accepts applications from [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] citizens and (occasionally) those from friendly nations who meet certain criteria. In 2016, it was decided to open all roles to women in 2018; women had not previously been permitted to join the [[Combat Arms]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.army.mod.uk/join/Women-in-the-Army.aspx|title=The British Army – Women in the Army|website=www.army.mod.uk|language=en|access-date=11 February 2017}}</ref> The British Army is an equal-opportunity employer (with some exceptions due to its medical standards), and does not discriminate based on race, religion or sexual orientation.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.army.mod.uk/join/Equality-and-diversity.aspx|title=The British Army – Diversity|website=www.army.mod.uk|language=en|access-date=11 February 2017}}</ref>

The minimum age is 16 (after the end of [[GCSE]]s), although soldiers under 18 may not serve in operations.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.army.mod.uk/training_education/24453.aspx|title=The British Army – Contact us/FAQs|website=www.army.mod.uk|language=en|access-date=9 March 2017}}</ref> The maximum recruitment age is 35 years and 6 months, and the maximum age for Army Reserve soldiers is 49 years old, {{as of|2018|November|lc=y}}. A soldier would traditionally enlist for a term of 22 years, although recently there has been a shift towards 12-year terms with a 22-year option. A soldier is not normally permitted to leave until they have served for at least four years, and must give 12 months' notice.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.army.mod.uk/documents/general/TermsofService.pdf|title=British Army Terms of Service|last=|first=|date=April 2015|website=|access-date=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170623005208/http://www.army.mod.uk/documents/general/TermsofService.pdf|archivedate=23 June 2017|df=dmy-all}}</ref>

=== Oath of allegiance ===
All soldiers must take an oath of allegiance upon joining the Army, a process known as attestation. Those who wish to swear by [[God in Abrahamic religions|God]] use the following words:<ref name=":2" />
{{quote|I, [soldier's name], swear by Almighty God that I will be faithful and bear true allegiance to [[Elizabeth II|Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II]], her heirs and successors and that I will as in duty bound honestly and faithfully defend Her Majesty, her heirs and successors in person, [[British Crown|crown]] and dignity against all enemies and will observe and obey all orders of Her Majesty, her heirs and successors and of the generals and officers set over me.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.whodareswins.com/british-army-oath-of-allegiance.html#selfless |title=British Army Oath of Allegiance |publisher= |date= |accessdate=29 November 2010}}</ref>}}

Each regiment and corps has distinctive insignia, such as a [[cap badge]], [[beret]], [[tactical recognition flash]] or [[stable belt]]. Many units also call soldiers of different ranks by different names; a NATO OR-1 (private) is called a guardsman in Guards regiments, a gunner in artillery units and a sapper in engineer units. These names do not affect a soldier's pay or role.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.army.mod.uk/structure/32321.aspx|title=The British Army – Ranks|website=www.army.mod.uk|language=en|access-date=9 March 2017}}</ref>

{{Further|Uniforms of the British Army}}

The British Army uniform has sixteen categories, ranging from ceremonial uniforms to combat dress to evening wear. No. 8 Dress, the day-to-day uniform, is known as "Personal Clothing System – Combat Uniform" (PCS-CU)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.army.mod.uk/equipment/23215.aspx|title=The British Army – Personal clothing|website=www.army.mod.uk|language=en|access-date=9 March 2017}}</ref> and consists of a [[Multi-Terrain Pattern]] (MTP) windproof smock, a lightweight jacket and trousers with ancillary items such as [[Long underwear|thermals]] and [[Raincoat|waterproofs]].<ref name=dresscodes>{{Cite web|url=http://www.forces80.com/dresscodes.htm|title=Dress Codes and Head Dress|publisher=Forces 80|accessdate=7 March 2017}}</ref> The army has introduced [[tactical recognition flash]]es (TRFs); worn on the right arm of a combat uniform, the insignia denotes the wearer's regiment or corps.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.iwm.org.uk/collections/item/object/30077060|title=badge, unit, tactical recognition flash, British, Royal Corps of Signals|publisher=Imperial War Museum|accessdate=7 March 2017}}</ref>

Working [[Headgear|headdress]] is typically a [[beret]], whose colour indicates its wearer's type of regiment. Beret colours are:<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.apparelsearch.com/definitions/headwear_hats/beret_definitions.htm|title=Beret definitions|publisher=Apparel Search|accessdate=7 March 2017}}</ref>
