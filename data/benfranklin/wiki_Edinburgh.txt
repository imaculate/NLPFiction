Historically part of the county of [[Midlothian]] (or Edinburghshire), it is located in [[Lothian]] on the [[Firth of Forth]]'s southern shore.

Recognised as the capital of Scotland since at least the 15th century, Edinburgh is the seat of the [[Scottish Government]], the [[Scottish Parliament]] and the [[Courts of Scotland|supreme courts of Scotland]]. The city's [[Holyrood Palace|Palace of Holyroodhouse]] is the [[official residence]] of the [[Monarchy of the United Kingdom|monarch]] in Scotland. The city has long been a centre of education, particularly in the fields of medicine, [[Scots law]], literature, philosophy, the sciences and engineering. It is the second largest financial centre in the [[United Kingdom]] (after [[London]])<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.investinedinburgh.com/industry-strengths/financial-services/ |title=Financial Services |author=Invest in Edinburgh |accessdate=3 October 2017 }}</ref> and the city's historical and cultural attractions have made it the United Kingdom's second most popular tourist destination (again, after London), attracting over one million overseas visitors each year.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-edinburgh-east-fife-13264345 |title=Edinburgh second in TripAdvisor UK tourism poll |accessdate=16 March 2013 |work=[[BBC News Online]] |date=3 May 2011}}</ref>

Edinburgh is Scotland's [[List of towns and cities in Scotland by population|second most populous city]] and the seventh most populous in the United Kingdom. The official population estimates are 464,990 (2012) for the [[List of towns and cities in Scotland by population#Localities|Locality]] of Edinburgh (Edinburgh pre 1975 regionalisation plus [[Currie]] and [[Balerno]]),<ref name="NRS Locality Estimate"/> 513,210 (2017) for the City of Edinburgh,<ref name="NRS LA Estimate"/> and 1,339,380 (2014) for the [[city region]].<ref name="NRS LA Estimate"/><ref name="City Region Definition">{{cite web|url=http://www.acceleratinggrowth.org.uk/about-us/ |title=Edinburgh and South East Scotland City Region|accessdate=25 November 2015}}</ref> Edinburgh lies at the heart of the Edinburgh and South East Scotland city region comprising [[East Lothian]], Edinburgh, [[Fife]], Midlothian, [[Scottish Borders]] and [[West Lothian]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.edinburgh.gov.uk/news/article/2329/city_region_deal_secured |title=City Region Deal secured |author=The City of Edinburgh Council |accessdate=3 October 2017 }}</ref>

The city is the annual venue of the [[General Assembly of the Church of Scotland]]. It is home to national institutions such as the [[National Museum of Scotland]], the [[National Library of Scotland]] and the [[Scottish National Gallery]]. The [[University of Edinburgh]], founded in 1582 and now one of four in the city, is placed 18th in the [[QS World University Rankings]] for 2019.<ref name="University Rankings"/> The city is also famous for the [[Edinburgh International Festival]] and the [[Edinburgh Festival Fringe|Fringe]], the latter being the world's largest annual international arts festival. Historic sites in Edinburgh include [[Edinburgh Castle]], the Palace of Holyroodhouse, the churches of [[St Giles Cathedral|St. Giles]], [[Greyfriars Kirk|Greyfriars]] and the [[Canongate Kirk|Canongate]], and the extensive Georgian New Town, built in the 18th/19th centuries. Edinburgh's [[Old Town, Edinburgh|Old Town]] and [[New Town, Edinburgh|New Town]] together are listed as a [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage site]],<ref name="www.edinburgh.org world-heritage-site">{{cite web |url=http://www.edinburgh.org/about/about-edinburgh/world-heritage-site |title=Edinburgh-World Heritage Site |accessdate=10 February 2013 |publisher=[[VisitScotland]] |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130222081642/http://www.edinburgh.org/about/about-edinburgh/world-heritage-site |archive-date=22 February 2013 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}</ref> which has been managed by [[Edinburgh World Heritage]] since 1999.

==Etymology==
{{main|Etymology of Edinburgh}}
"Edin", the root of the city's name, derives from ''[[Eidyn]]'', the name for this region in [[Cumbric]], the [[Brittonic languages|Brittonic]] [[Celtic languages|Celtic]] language formerly spoken there. The name's meaning is unknown.<ref name=Gelling>{{cite book | last1= Gelling | first1= Margaret | author-link1= Margaret Gelling | last2= Nicolaisen| first2= W. F. H.| author-link2= W. F. H. Nicolaisen| last3= Richards| first3= Melville | author-link3= |date= 1970 |title= The Names of Towns and Cities in Britain | location= |publisher= Batsford |pages= 88–89 |isbn= 0-7134-5235-8}}</ref> The district of Eidyn centred on the stronghold Din Eidyn, the [[dun]] or [[hillfort]] of Eidyn.<ref name=Gelling/> This stronghold is believed to have been located at [[Castle Rock, Edinburgh|Castle Rock]], now the site of [[Edinburgh Castle]]. Eidyn was conquered by the [[Angles]] of [[Bernicia]] in the 7th century and later by the Scots in the 10th century.<ref name=Driscoll229>{{cite book | last1= Driscoll | first1= Stephen | last2= Yeoman | first2= Peter A. |date= 1997 |series= Society of Antiquaries of Scotland monograph series|title= Excavations within Edinburgh Castle in 1988-91 |volume= 12 |publisher= [[Society of Antiquaries of Scotland]] |page=229 |isbn= 0-903-903121 }}</ref> As the language shifted to [[Old English]], and subsequently to modern English and [[Scots language|Scots]], The Brittonic ''din'' in Din Eidyn was replaced by ''[[burh]]'', producing ''Edinburgh''. Similarly, ''din'' became ''dùn'' in [[Scottish Gaelic]], producing ''Dùn Èideann''.<ref name=Gelling/><ref>{{cite book |title=Placenames of the World |last=Room |first=Adrian |year=2006 |publisher=McFarland |isbn=978-0-7864-2248-7 |pages=118–119 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=M1JIPAN-eJ4C |accessdate=12 August 2011}}</ref>

== Nicknames ==
[[File:Surgeons Hall - geograph.org.uk - 1315862.jpg|thumb|[[Surgeons' Hall]] - one of the [[Greek Revival architecture|Greek Revival]] buildings that earned Edinburgh the nickname "Athens of the North"]]

The city is affectionately nicknamed ''Auld Reekie'',<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dsl.ac.uk/entry/snd/auld|title=Dictionary of the Scots Language :: SND :: Auld adj.|website=www.dsl.ac.uk}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dsl.ac.uk/entry/snd/reek_n1_v|title=Dictionary of the Scots Language :: SND :: Reek n.1, v.|website=www.dsl.ac.uk}}</ref> Scots for ''Old Smoky'', for the views from the country of the smoke-covered Old Town.
[[Allan Ramsay (poet)|Allan Ramsay]] said, "Auld Reeky. A name the country people give Edinburgh from the cloud of smoke or reek that is always impending over it."<ref>{{cite book |last=Ramsay |first1=Allan |authorlink=Allan Ramsay (poet) |title=The poems of Allan Ramsay |volume=1 |page=50 }}</ref>

[[Thomas Carlyle]] said, "Smoke cloud hangs over old Edinburgh,—for, ever since [[Pope Pius II|Aeneas Silvius]]'s time and earlier, the people have the art, very strange to Aeneas, of burning a certain sort of black stones, and Edinburgh with its chimneys is called 'Auld Reekie' by the country people."<ref>{{cite book | last1 = Carlyle | first1 = Thomas | authorlink1 = Thomas Carlyle | title = Historical Sketches.… | pages = 304–305 | url = https://archive.org/stream/historicalsketc00carlgoog#page/n322/mode/2up | accessdate = 2018-05-13}}</ref>

A character in [[Walter Scott]]'s ''[[The Abbot]]'' says "... yonder stands Auld Reekie--you may see the smoke hover over her at twenty miles' distance."<ref>{{cite book | last1 = Scott | first1 = Walter | authorlink1 = Walter Scott | title = The Abbot | url = http://www.online-literature.com/walter_scott/the-abbot/17/ | accessdate = 2018-05-13}}</ref>

[[Robert Chambers (publisher born 1802)|Robert Chambers]] who said that the sobriquet could not be traced before the reign of [[Charles II of England|Charles II]] attributed the name to a [[Fife]] laird, Durham of Largo, who regulated the bedtime of his children by the smoke rising above Edinburgh from the fires of the tenements. "It's time now bairns, to tak' the beuks, and gang to our beds, for yonder's Auld Reekie, I see, putting on her nicht -cap!"<ref>{{cite book | last1 = Chambers | first1 = Robert | authorlink1 = Robert Chambers (publisher born 1802) | title = Traditions of Edinburgh | page = 168 | url = https://archive.org/stream/traditionsofedin00cham#page/168/mode/2up | accessdate = 2018-05-13}}</ref>

Some have called Edinburgh the ''Athens of the North'' for a variety of reasons. The earliest comparison between the two cities showed that they had a similar topography, with the [[Castle Rock (Edinburgh)|Castle Rock]] of Edinburgh performing a similar role to the [[Athens|Athenian]] [[Acropolis, Athens|Acropolis]]. Both of them had flatter, fertile agricultural land sloping down to a [[port]] several miles away (respectively [[Leith]] and [[Piraeus]]). Although this arrangement is common in [[Southern Europe]], it is rare in [[Northern Europe]]. The 18th-century intellectual life, referred to as the [[Scottish Enlightenment]], was a key influence in gaining the name. Such luminaries as [[David Hume]] and [[Adam Smith]] shone during this period. Having lost most of its political importance after the [[Treaty of Union 1707|Union]], some hoped that Edinburgh could gain a similar influence on London as Athens had on Rome. Also a contributing factor was the later [[Neoclassicism|neoclassical]] architecture, particularly that of [[William Henry Playfair]], and the [[National Monument, Edinburgh|National Monument]]. [[Tom Stoppard]]'s character Archie, of [[Jumpers]], said, perhaps playing on [[Reykjavík]] meaning "smoky bay", that the "Reykjavík of the South" would be more appropriate.<ref>Stoppard, Tom. ''Jumpers'', Grove Press, 1972, p. 69.</ref>

The city has also been known by several Latin names, such as ''Aneda'' or ''Edina''. The adjectival form of the latter, ''Edinensis'', can often be seen inscribed on educational buildings.<ref>{{Cite book |contribution=A |url=http://www.columbia.edu/acis/ets/Graesse/orblata.html |titlelink=Orbis Latinus |last=Grässe |first=J.

The Scots poets [[Robert Fergusson]] and [[Robert Burns]] used the city's Latin name, ''Edina'' in their poems. [[Ben Jonson]] described it as "Britaine's other eye",<ref>[http://cco.cambridge.org/extract?id=ccol0521641136_CCOL0521641136A003 The Cambridge Companion to Ben Jonson]. Retrieved 17 April 2007.</ref> and Sir Walter Scott referred to it as "yon Empress of the North".<ref>[http://www2.hn.psu.edu/faculty/jmanis/w-scott/marmion.pdf Marmion A Tale of Flodden Field by Walter Scott]. Retrieved 17 April 2007.</ref> Robert Louis Stevenson, also a son of the city, wrote, "Edinburgh is what Paris ought to be".

The colloquial pronunciation "Embra" or "Embro" has also been used,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.purr.demon.co.uk/embro/ |title=Embro, Embro - the hidden history of Edinburgh in its music |publisher=Purr.demon.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2009-07-08}}</ref> as in [[Robert Garioch]]'s ''Embro to the Ploy''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.edinburghliterarypubtour.co.uk/makars/garioch/embro.html |title=Makars Literary Tour &#124; Robert Garioch |publisher=Edinburghliterarypubtour.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2009-07-08}}</ref>

===Early history===
[[File:Arthurs seat edinburgh.jpg|thumb|right|Edinburgh, showing Arthur's Seat, one of the earliest known sites of human habitation in the area]]

The earliest known human habitation in the Edinburgh area was at [[Cramond]], where evidence was found of a [[Mesolithic]] camp site dated to c. 8500 BC.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.archaeologyuk.org/ba/ba60/news.shtml |title=Earliest evidence found of settlers in Scotland: hazelnuts and stone tools excavated near Edinburgh date to around 8500 BC |accessdate=31 October 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131102050435/http://www.archaeologyuk.org/ba/ba60/news.shtml |archivedate=2 November 2013 |df= }}</ref> Traces of later [[Bronze Age]] and [[Iron Age]] settlements have been found on Castle Rock, [[Arthur's Seat]], [[Craiglockhart Hill]] and the [[Pentland Hills]].<ref>{{cite book |last=Coghill |first=Hamish  |title=Lost Edinburgh |year=2008 |publisher=Birlinn Ltd |isbn=978-1-84158-747-9 |pages=1–2}}</ref>

When the [[Roman Empire|Romans]] arrived in Lothian at the end of the 1st century AD, they found a [[Celtic Britons|Brittonic]] Celtic tribe whose name they recorded as the [[Votadini]].<ref>{{cite book |last=Ritchie |first=J. N.

During this period, the Castle Rock site, thought to have been the stronghold of Din Eidyn, emerged as the kingdom's major centre.<ref>{{cite book | last1= Driscoll | first1= Stephen | last2= Yeoman | first2= Peter A. |date= 1997 |series= Society of Antiquaries of Scotland monograph series|title= Excavations within Edinburgh Castle in 1988-91 |volume= 12 |publisher= [[Society of Antiquaries of Scotland]] |page=227 |isbn= 0-903-903121 }}</ref> The medieval poem ''[[Y Gododdin]]'' describes a war band from across the Brittonic world who gathered in Eidyn before a fateful raid; this may describe a historical event around AD 600.<ref>{{Cite book |title=The Beginnings of Welsh Poetry: Studies |last=Williams |first=Ifor |authorlink=Ifor Williams |year=1972 |publisher=University of Wales Press |isbn=978-0-7083-0035-0 |page=47}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book |title=The British Heroic Age: the Welsh and the Men of the North |last=Chadwick |first=Nora K. |authorlink=Nora K.

In 638, the Gododdin stronghold was besieged by forces loyal to [[Oswald of Northumbria|King Oswald]] of [[Northumbria]], and around this time control of Lothian passed to the [[Angles]].

In the 17th century, Edinburgh's boundaries were still defined by the city's defensive [[Edinburgh town walls|town walls]]. As a result, the city's growing population was accommodated by increasing the height of the houses.

Following the [[Treaty of Union]] in 1706, the Parliaments of England and Scotland passed [[Acts of Union 1707|Acts of Union]] in 1706 and 1707 respectively, uniting the two kingdoms in the [[Kingdom of Great Britain]] effective from 1 May 1707.<ref>{{cite book |last=Scott |first=Paul |title=1707: the Union of Scotland and England |year=1979 |publisher=Chambers |isbn=978-0-550-20265-9 |pages=51–54}}</ref> As a consequence, the [[Parliament of Scotland]] merged with the [[Parliament of England]] to form the [[Parliament of Great Britain]], which sat at [[Palace of Westminster|Westminster]] in London.

From the 1770s onwards, the professional and business classes gradually deserted the Old Town in favour of the more elegant "one-family" residences of the New Town, a migration that changed the city's social character. According to the foremost historian of this development, "Unity of social feeling was one of the most valuable heritages of old Edinburgh, and its disappearance was widely and properly lamented."<ref>{{cite book |last=Youngson |first=A J  |title=The Making of Classical Edinburgh |year=1988 |publisher=Edinburgh University Press |isbn=978-0-85224-576-7|page=256}}</ref>

Although Edinburgh's traditional industries of printing, brewing and distilling continued to grow in the 19th century, and were joined by new [[Hunter Boot Ltd|rubber works]] and [[Engineering|engineering works]], there was little industrialisation compared with other cities in Britain.

==Geography==

===Cityscape===
Situated in Scotland's [[Central Belt]], Edinburgh lies on the Firth of Forth's southern shore. The city centre is {{convert|2+1/2|mi|km}} southwest of the shoreline of [[Leith]] and {{convert|26|mi|km}} inland, as the crow flies, from the east coast of Scotland and the [[North Sea]] at [[Dunbar]].<ref>{{cite map |title=Geographia Atlas of the World |year=1984 |publisher=Geographia Ltd |location=London |isbn=0-09-202840-3 |page=99}}</ref> While the early burgh grew up near the prominent Castle Rock, the modern city is often said to be built on [[Hills in Edinburgh|seven hills]], namely Calton Hill, [[Corstorphine Hill]], Craiglockhart Hill, [[Braid Hills|Braid Hill]], [[Blackford Hill]], Arthur's Seat and the Castle Rock,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.seven-hills.org.uk/course.asp |title=Seven Hills of Edinburgh |accessdate=28 February 2013 |publisher=[[VisitScotland]]}}</ref> giving rise to allusions to the [[seven hills of Rome]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.scotland.org/features/voltaire-said |title=Voltaire said: Athens of the North |publisher=Scotland.org |date=September 2003 |accessdate=28 March 2013}}</ref>

Occupying a narrow gap between the Firth of Forth to the north and the [[Pentland Hills]] and their outrunners to the south, the city sprawls over a landscape which is the product of early volcanic activity and later periods of intensive glaciation.

===Areas===
Edinburgh includes former towns and villages that retain much of their original character as settlements in existence before they were absorbed into the expanding city of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.edinburghguide.com/areas |title=Edinburgh Areas |publisher=edinburghguide.com |accessdate=9 February 2013}}</ref> Many areas, such as [[Dalry, Edinburgh|Dalry]] contain residences that are multi-occupancy buildings known as [[tenement]]s, although the more southern and western parts of the city have traditionally been more affluent with a greater number of detached and semi-detached villas.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.timeout.com/edinburgh/features/146/edinburgh-area-guide |title=Edinburgh area guide |publisher=timeout.com |accessdate=9 February 2013}}</ref>
[[File:Edinburgh map.png|thumb|Map showing the areas of central Edinburgh]]
The historic centre of Edinburgh is divided in two by the broad green swathe of [[Princes Street Gardens]]. To the south the view is dominated by Edinburgh Castle, built high on Castle Rock, and the long sweep of the Old Town descending towards Holyrood Palace. To the north lie Princes Street and the New Town.

The West End includes the financial district, with insurance and banking offices as well as the Edinburgh International Conference Centre.

Edinburgh's Old and New Towns were listed as a UNESCO [[World Heritage Site]] in 1995 in recognition of the unique character of the Old Town with its medieval street layout and the planned Georgian New Town, including the adjoining Dean Village and Calton Hill areas. There are over 4,500 [[Listed building (United Kingdom)|listed buildings]] within the city,<ref name="www.edinburgh.org world-heritage-site"/> a higher proportion relative to area than any other city in the United Kingdom.

The [[Royal Mile]] runs downhill and terminates at Holyrood Palace. Minor streets (called closes or [[wynd]]s) lie on either side of the main spine forming a herringbone pattern.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/728 |title=Old and New Towns of Edinburgh |publisher=UNESCO |accessdate=9 February 2013}}</ref> The street has several fine public buildings such as St Giles' Cathedral, the [[Edinburgh City Chambers|City Chambers]] and the [[Parliament House, Edinburgh|Law Courts]]. Other places of historical interest nearby are [[Greyfriars Kirkyard]] and the [[Grassmarket]]. The street layout is typical of the old quarters of many northern European cities.

The castle perches on top of a rocky crag (the remnant of an extinct volcano) and the Royal Mile runs down the crest of a ridge from it. Due to space restrictions imposed by the narrowness of this landform, the Old Town became home to some of the earliest "high rise" residential buildings. Multi-storey dwellings known as ''lands'' were the norm from the 16th century onwards with ten and eleven storeys being typical and one even reaching fourteen or fifteen storeys.<ref>{{cite book | last1 = Chambers | first1 = Robert | authorlink1 = Robert Chambers (publisher born 1802) | title = Notices of the most remarkable fires in Edinburgh: from 1385 to 1824&nbsp;… | url = https://books.google.com/?id=BFkLAAAAYAAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Notices+of+the+most+remarkable+fires+in+Edinburgh,+from+1385+to+1824#v=onepage&q=fifteen&f=false | accessdate =9 January 2012 | year = 1824}}</ref> Numerous vaults below street level were inhabited to accommodate the influx of incomers, particularly [[Irish migration to Great Britain|Irish immigrants]], during the [[Industrial Revolution]].

The New Town was an 18th-century solution to the problem of an increasingly crowded city which had been confined to the ridge sloping down from the castle. In 1766 a competition to design a "New Town" was won by [[James Craig (architect)|James Craig]], a 27-year-old architect.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Cruft, Kitty |title=James Craig 1739–1795: Correction of his Date of Birth |journal=Book of the Old Edinburgh Club |volume=New Series Vol. 5 |pages=103–5}}</ref> The plan was a rigid, ordered grid, which fitted in well with [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] ideas of rationality. The principal street was to be [[George Street, Edinburgh|George Street]], running along the natural ridge to the north of what became known as the "Old Town". To either side of it are two other main streets: Princes Street and Queen Street. Princes Street has become Edinburgh's main shopping street and now has few of its [[Georgian architecture|Georgian]] buildings in their original state. The three main streets are connected by a series of streets running perpendicular to them. The east and west ends of George Street are terminated by [[St Andrew Square, Edinburgh|St Andrew Square]] and [[Charlotte Square]] respectively. The latter, designed by [[Robert Adam]], influenced the architectural style of the New Town into the early 19th century.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.historic-scotland.gov.uk/architectsactive.pdf |title=Scottish Architects Homecoming |publisher=Historic Scotland |accessdate=18 January 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111119084414/http://www.historic-scotland.gov.uk/architectsactive.pdf |archivedate=19 November 2011 |df=dmy }}</ref> [[Bute House]], the official residence of the [[First Minister of Scotland]], is on the north side of Charlotte Square.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.edinburghguide.com/venue/butehouse |title=Bute House |publisher=edinburghguide.com |accessdate=9 February 2013}}</ref>

The hollow between the Old and New Towns was formerly the [[Nor Loch]], which was created for the town's defence but came to be used by the inhabitants for dumping their [[sewage]]. It was drained by the 1820s as part of the city's northward expansion. Craig's original plan included an ornamental canal on the site of the loch,<ref name="princeshist"/> but this idea was abandoned.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.scotsman.com/news/from-monks-on-strike-to-dove-s-dung-1-881129|title=From monks on strike to dove's dung |publisher=scotsman.com |accessdate=9 February 2013}}</ref> Soil excavated while laying the foundations of buildings in the New Town was dumped on the site of the [[loch]] to create the slope connecting the Old and New Towns known as [[The Mound]].

In the middle of the 19th century the [[National Gallery of Scotland]] and [[Royal Scottish Academy Building]] were built on the Mound, and tunnels for the railway line between [[Haymarket railway station|Haymarket]] and [[Edinburgh Waverley railway station|Waverley]] stations were driven through it.

The Southside is a popular residential part of the city, which includes the districts of St Leonards, [[Marchmont]], [[Morningside, Edinburgh|Morningside]], [[Newington, Edinburgh|Newington]], [[Sciennes]], [[The Grange, Edinburgh|the Grange]] and [[Blackford, Edinburgh|Blackford]]. The Southside is broadly analogous to the area covered formerly by the [[Burgh Muir]], and grew in popularity as a residential area after the opening of the [[South Bridge, Edinburgh|South Bridge]] in the 1780s. The Southside is particularly popular with families (many state and private schools are here), young professionals and students (the central University of Edinburgh campus is based around [[George Square, Edinburgh|George Square]] just north of Marchmont and [[The Meadows (park)|the Meadows]]), and [[Napier University]] (with major campuses around Merchiston and Morningside). The area is also well provided with hotel and "bed and breakfast" accommodation for visiting festival-goers. These districts often feature in works of fiction. For example, [[Church Hill, Edinburgh|Church Hill]] in Morningside, was the home of [[Muriel Spark]]'s Miss Jean Brodie,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.geraldinemcewan.com/JeanBrodie.html |title=The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie |publisher=geraldinemcewan.com |accessdate=9 February 2013}}</ref> and [[Ian Rankin]]'s [[Inspector Rebus]] lives in Marchmont and works in St Leonards.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ianrankin.net/pages/content/index.asp?PageID=12 |title=Inspector Rebus Novels |publisher=ianrankin.net |accessdate=9 February 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130303085742/https://www.ianrankin.net/pages/content/index.asp?PageID=12 |archivedate=3 March 2013 |df=dmy }}</ref>

With the redevelopment, Edinburgh has gained the business of cruise liner companies which now provide cruises to Norway, Sweden, Denmark, Germany, and the Netherlands.

The coastal suburb of [[Portobello, Edinburgh|Portobello]] is characterised by Georgian villas, Victorian tenements, a popular beach and [[promenade]] and cafés, bars, restaurants and independent shops. There are rowing and sailing clubs and a restored Victorian swimming pool, including [[Turkish bath]]s.

The [[List of towns and cities in Scotland by population#Settlements|urban area]] of Edinburgh is almost entirely within the [[The City of Edinburgh Council|City of Edinburgh Council]] boundary, merging with [[Musselburgh]] in East Lothian. Towns within easy reach of the city boundary include [[Haddington, East Lothian|Haddington]], [[Tranent]], [[Prestonpans]], [[Dalkeith]], [[Bonnyrigg]], [[Loanhead]], [[Penicuik]], [[Broxburn, West Lothian|Broxburn]], [[Livingston, West Lothian|Livingston]] and [[Dunfermline]]. Edinburgh lies at the heart of the Edinburgh & South East Scotland City region with a population in 2014 of 1,339,380.<ref name="NRS LA Estimate"/><ref name="City Region Definition"/>

===Climate===
Like most of Scotland, Edinburgh has a [[temperate climate|temperate]], [[maritime climate]] which is relatively mild despite its northerly latitude.<ref name="temperature">{{cite web|url=http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/climate/uk/regional-climates/es |title=Regional Climate – Eastern Scotland |accessdate=19 April 2009 |publisher=Met Office}}</ref> Winter daytime temperatures rarely fall below freezing and are milder than places such as [[Moscow]] and [[Labrador]] which lie at similar latitudes.<ref name="temperature"/> Summer temperatures are normally moderate, rarely exceeding {{convert|22|C}}.<ref name="temperature"/> The highest temperature ever recorded in the city was {{convert|31.4|C}} on 4 August 1975<ref name="temperature"/> at Turnhouse Airport.

The city's proximity to the sea mitigates any large variations in temperature or extremes of climate. Given Edinburgh's position between the coast and hills, it is renowned as "the windy city", with the prevailing wind direction coming from the south west, which is often associated with warm, unstable air from the [[North Atlantic Current]] that can give rise to rainfall – although considerably less than cities to the west, such as Glasgow.<ref name="temperature"/> Rainfall is distributed fairly evenly throughout the year.<ref name="temperature"/> Winds from an easterly direction are usually drier but considerably colder, and may be accompanied by [[haar (fog)|haar]], a persistent coastal fog. Vigorous Atlantic depressions, known as [[European windstorm]]s, can affect the city between October and May.<ref name="temperature"/>

There is also a weather station in Gogarbank on the city's outskirts.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/public/weather/climate/gcvw5vmsn|title=Edinburgh Gogarbank Climate Averages 1981–2010|publisher=Met Office|accessdate=11 August 2015}}</ref> This slightly inland station has a slightly wider temperature span between seasons, is cloudier and somewhat wetter, but differences are minor.

==Demography==

===Current===
The most recent official population estimates are 512,150 (2016) for the Edinburgh Locality<ref>https://www.nrscotland.gov.uk/files//statistics/settlements-localities/set-loc-16/set-loc-2016-publication-updated.pdf</ref> and 513,210 (2017) for the local authority area.<ref>https://www.nrscotland.gov.uk/files//statistics/population-estimates/mid-17/mid-year-pop-est-17-publication-revised.pdf</ref> 

Edinburgh has a high proportion of young adults, with 19.5% of the population in their 20s (exceeded only by Aberdeen) and 15.2% in their 30s which is the highest in Scotland. The proportion of Edinburgh's population born in the UK fell from 92% to 84% between 2001 and 2011, while the proportion born in Scotland fell from 78% to 70%. Of those Edinburgh residents born in the UK, 335,000 or 83% were born in Scotland, with 58,000 or 14% being born in England.<ref name="edinburgh.gov.uk">{{cite web|url=http://www.edinburgh.gov.uk/download/downloads/id/11895/census_2011-ethnicity_and_related_themes_ethnic_group_country_of_birth_national_identity_religion_languages_etc |title=Archived copy |accessdate=29 December 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140102194252/http://www.edinburgh.gov.uk/download/downloads/id/11895/census_2011-ethnicity_and_related_themes_ethnic_group_country_of_birth_national_identity_religion_languages_etc |archivedate=2 January 2014 |df=dmy }}</ref>

Some 13,000 people or 2.7% of the city's population are of [[Poles in the United Kingdom|Polish]] descent. 39,500 people or 8.2% of Edinburgh's population class themselves as Non-White which is an increase from 4% in 2001. Of the Non-White population, the largest group by far are [[Asian-Scots|Asian]], totalling 26,264 people. Within the Asian population, people of [[British Chinese|Chinese]] descent are now the largest sub-group, with 8,076 people, amounting to about 1.7% of the city's total population. The city's population of [[British Indian|Indian]] descent amounts to 6,470 (1.4% of the total population), while there are some 5,858 [[British Pakistanis|Pakistani]] descent (1.2% of the total population). Although they account for only 1,277 people or 0.3% of the city's population, Edinburgh has the highest number and proportion of people of [[British Bangladeshi|Bangladeshi]] descent in Scotland. Over 7,000 people were born in African countries (1.6% of the total population) and nearly 7,000 in the Americas. With the notable exception of Inner London, Edinburgh has a higher number of people born in the United States (over 3,700) than any other city in the UK.<ref name="edinburgh.gov.uk"/>

The proportion of people born outside the UK was 15.9% compared with 8% in 2001.

A census by the Edinburgh presbytery in 1592 recorded a population of 8,003 adults spread equally north and south of the High Street which runs along the spine of the ridge sloping down from the Castle.<ref>{{cite book |last=Lynch |first=Michael |title=The Oxford Companion to Scottish History |url= |accessdate= |year=2001 |publisher=OUP Oxford |location= |isbn=978-0-19-969305-4 |page=219 }}</ref> In the 18th and 19th centuries, the population expanded rapidly, rising from 49,000 in 1751 to 136,000 in 1831, primarily due to migration from rural areas.<ref name="overcrowding">{{cite book |title=Edinburgh: The Making of a Capital City |last1=Edwards |first1=Brian |last2=Jenkins |first2=Paul |year=2005 |isbn=978-0-7486-1868-2  |publisher= |page= 9}}</ref> As the population grew, problems of overcrowding in the Old Town, particularly in the cramped [[tenement]]s that lined the present day Royal Mile and the [[Cowgate]], were exacerbated.<ref name="overcrowding"/> Poor sanitary arrangements resulted in a high incidence of disease,<ref name="overcrowding"/> with outbreaks of [[cholera]] occurring in 1832, 1848 and 1866.<ref>{{cite book |last=Gilbert (ed.) |first=W M |title= Edinburgh in the Nineteenth Century |year=1967 |publisher=J & R Allan Ltd. |location= Edinburgh |origyear= 1901 |pages=95, 120, 140}}</ref>

The construction of the New Town from 1767 onwards witnessed the migration of the professional and business classes from the difficult living conditions in the Old Town to the lower density, higher quality surroundings taking shape on land to the north.

Early 20th century population growth coincided with lower-density suburban development. As the city expanded to the south and west, detached and semi-detached villas with large gardens replaced tenements as the predominant building style. Nonetheless, the 2001 census revealed that over 55% of Edinburgh's population were still living in tenements or blocks of flats, a figure in line with other Scottish cities, but much higher than other British cities, and even central London.<ref name="dwellings">{{cite web|url=http://download.edinburgh.gov.uk/Census_2001_City_Comparisons/CCTable4Dwellings.pdf |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090318032701/http://download.edinburgh.gov.uk/Census_2001_City_Comparisons/CCTable4Dwellings.pdf |archivedate=18 March 2009 |title=Edinburgh Comparisons – Dwellings |accessdate=8 February 2009 |publisher=City of Edinburgh Council |deadurl=yes |df=dmy }}</ref>

From the early to mid 20th century the growth in population, together with slum clearance in the Old Town and other areas, such as [[Dumbiedykes]], [[Leith]], and [[Fountainbridge]], led to the creation of new estates such as [[Stenhouse, Edinburgh|Stenhouse]] and [[Saughton]], [[Craigmillar]] and [[Niddrie, Edinburgh|Niddrie]], [[Pilton, Edinburgh|Pilton]] and [[Muirhouse]], [[Piershill]], and [[Sighthill, Edinburgh|Sighthill]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.localhistories.org/edinburgh.html |title=A BRIEF HISTORY OF EDINBURGH, SCOTLAND |accessdate=9 February 2013 |publisher=localhistories.org}}</ref>

Banking has been a mainstay of the Edinburgh economy for over 300 years, since the [[Bank of Scotland]] (now part of the [[Lloyds Banking Group]]) was established by an act of the [[Parliament of Scotland|Scottish Parliament]] in 1695. Today, the financial services industry, with its particularly strong insurance and investment sectors, and underpinned by Edinburgh-based firms such as [[Scottish Widows]] and [[Standard Life Aberdeen]], accounts for the city being the UK's second financial centre after London and Europe's fourth in terms of equity assets.<ref name="financial">{{cite web|url=http://www.edinburgh-inspiringcapital.com/invest/key_business_sectors/financial_services.aspx |title=Edinburgh's financial services sector |accessdate=11 May 2010 |publisher=Edinburgh Brand |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101116235214/http://www.edinburgh-inspiringcapital.com/invest/key_business_sectors/financial_services.aspx |archivedate=16 November 2010 }}</ref> The [[Royal Bank of Scotland]] opened new global headquarters at [[Gogarburn]] in the west of the city in October 2005, and Edinburgh is home to the headquarters of [[Bank of Scotland]], [[Sainsbury's Bank]],<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/newsbysector/banksandfinance/10920928/Sainsburys-Bank-hires-500-staff-in-travel-money-push.html |title=Sainsburys-Bank-hires-500-staff-in-travel-money-push |accessdate=24 June 2014 |work=The Telegraph |location=Edinburgh|date=24 June 2014}}</ref> [[Tesco Bank]],<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.scotsman.com/news/tesco-creates-200-banking-jobs-in-edinburgh-1-831884|title=Tesco creates 200 banking jobs in Edinburgh |accessdate=9 February 2013 |work=The Scotsman |location=Edinburgh|date=2 March 2009}}</ref> [[TSB Bank (United Kingdom)|TSB Bank]] and [[Virgin Money UK|Virgin Money]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://news.scotsman.com/virgin/Virgin-Money-provides--jobs.5977175.jp|title=Virgin Money provides jobs boost for city|accessdate=10 May 2010 |work=The Scotsman |location=Edinburgh|date=13 January 2010}}</ref>

Tourism is also an important element in the city's economy. As a World Heritage Site, tourists visit historical sites such as Edinburgh Castle, the Palace of Holyroodhouse and the Old and New Towns. Their numbers are augmented in August each year during the [[Edinburgh Festival]]s, which attracts 4.4&nbsp;million visitors,<ref name="Edinburgh Economy Watch April 2010"/> and generates over £100m for the local economy.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.edfringe.com/story.html?id=923 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927195132/http://www.edfringe.com/story.html?id=923 |archivedate=27 September 2007 |title=2004 Festival Economic Impact Study results |accessdate=23 March 2007 |date=14 October 2005 |publisher=Edinburgh Festival Fringe |deadurl=yes |df=dmy }}</ref>

As the centre of Scotland's government and [[Scots law|legal system]], the public sector plays a central role in Edinburgh's economy. Many departments of the Scottish Government are in the city. Other major employers include [[NHS Scotland]] and [[local government of Scotland|local government]] administration.<ref name="Edinburgh by Numbers"/>
