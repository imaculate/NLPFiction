'''Electrotherapy''' is the use of [[electrical energy]] as a medical treatment.<ref>Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers, "''The IEEE standard dictionary of electrical and electronics terms''". 6th ed. New York, N.Y., Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers, c1997. IEEE Std 100-1996. {{ISBN|1-55937-833-6}} [''ed''. Standards Coordinating Committee 10, Terms and Definitions; Jane Radatz, (chair)]</ref> In [[medicine]], the term ''electrotherapy'' can apply to a variety of treatments, including the use of electrical devices such as [[deep brain stimulation|deep brain stimulators]] for neurological disease. The term has also been applied specifically to the use of electric current to speed wound healing. Additionally, the term "electrotherapy" or "electromagnetic therapy" has also been applied to a range of [[alternative medicine|alternative medical]] devices and treatments.

==History==
[[File:Oudin coil - Treatment by the effiuvation method.jpg|upright|thumb|Electric shock treatment with an [[Oudin coil]]]]
The first recorded treatment of a patient by electricity was by Johann Gottlob Krüger in 1743.  [[John Wesley]] promoted electrical treatment as a universal panacea in 1747 but was rejected by mainstream medicine.  [[Giovanni Aldini]] treated insanity with static electricity 1823-1824.<ref>Chalovich, Joseph M, [http://thescholarship.ecu.edu/handle/10342/3929 'Franklinization: Early Therapeutic Use of Static Electricity''], ScholarShip, East Carolina University, 23 January 2012</ref>

The first medical treatments with electricity in London have been recorded as far back as 1767 at [[Middlesex Hospital]] in London using a special apparatus. The same was purchased for [[St Bartholomew's Hospital|St. Bartholomew's Hospital]] only ten years later. The record of uses other than being therapeutic is not clear, however [[Guy's Hospital]] has a published list of cases from the earlier 1800s.<ref name="SteavensonWE">{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lwCqB7S8KnoC | title=Medical electricity | publisher=P. Blakiston, Son & Company | author=Steavenson, William Edward | year=1892 | location=Philadelphia | page=3}}</ref> [[Golding Bird]] at Guy's brought electrotherapy into the mainstream in the mid-19th century.<ref>Morus, Iwan Rhys, ''Frankenstein's Children: Electricity, Exhibition, and Experiment in Early-nineteenth-century London'', pp. 234-237, Princeton University Press, 1998 {{ISBN|0691059527}}</ref>  In the second half of the 19th century the emphasis moved from delivering large shocks to the whole body to more measured doses, the [[Effective dose (pharmacology)|minimum effective]].<ref>Chalovich, 36' 0"</ref>

===Apparatus===
Some equipments historically used in electrotherapy include;
* The [[Electric bath (electrotherapy)|electric bath]] for high-voltage static induction
* [[Oudin coil]], a high-voltage induction coil, in use around 1900
* [[Pulvermacher's chain]], a wearable electrochemical device mostly used by [[quackery|quacks]], in use second half of 19th century
* [[Leyden jar]]s, an early form of [[capacitor]], for storing electricity
* [[Electrostatic generator]]s of various sorts

=== People ===
Some important people in the history of electrotherapy include;
* [[Luigi Galvani]], a pioneer of medical electricity
* [[Benjamin Franklin]], an early proponent of electrotherapy who made it widely known, but unfortunately mostly taken up by quacks and charlatans
* Golding Bird, mentioned above
* [[Duchenne de Boulogne]]
* [[Jacques-Arsène d'Arsonval]]
* [[George Miller Beard]]
* [[Margaret Cleaves]], a promoter of [[ozone therapy]]
* Many of the [[List of forms of electricity named after scientists|forms of electricity]] used in electrotherapy were named after scientists

* [[Franz Mesmer]]

===Muscle stimulation===
In 1856 [[Guillaume Duchenne]] announced that [[Alternating current|alternating]] was superior to [[direct current]] for electrotherapeutic triggering of muscle contractions.<ref>Licht, Sidney Herman., "History of Electrotherapy", in Therapeutic Electricity and Ultraviolet Radiation, 2nd ed., ed. Sidney Licht, New Haven: E. Licht, 1967, Pp. 1-70.</ref> What he called the 'warming affect' of direct currents irritated the skin, since, at voltage strengths needed for muscle contractions, they cause the skin to blister (at the [[anode]]) and pit (at the [[cathode]]). Furthermore, with DC each contraction required the current to be stopped and restarted. Moreover, alternating current could produce strong muscle contractions regardless of the condition of the muscle, whereas DC-induced contractions were strong if the muscle was strong, and weak if the muscle was weak.

Since that time almost all rehabilitation involving muscle contraction has been done with a symmetrical rectangular biphasic waveform. During the 1940s, however, the [[U.S. War Department]], investigating the application of electrical stimulation not just to retard and prevent atrophy but to restore muscle mass and strength, employed what was termed ''galvanic exercise'' on the atrophied hands of patients who had an ulnar nerve lesion from surgery upon a wound.<ref>Licht, "History of Electrotherapy"</ref> These galvanic exercises employed a monophasic wave form, direct current.

===Cancer treatment===
In the field of cancer treatment, DC electrotherapy showed promise as early as 1959, when a study published in the journal ''Science'' reported total destruction of tumor in 60% of subjects, which was very noteworthy for an initial study.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Humphrey|first=C.E.|author2=Seal, E.H.|title=Biophysical approach toward tumor regression in mice|journal=Science|year=1959|volume=130|pages=388–390|doi=10.1126/science.130.3372.388}}</ref> 
In 1985, the journal ''Cancer Research ''published the most remarkable such study, reporting 98% shrinkage of tumor in animal subjects on being treated with DC electrotherapy for only five hours over five days.<ref>{{cite journal|last=David|first=S.L|author2=Absolom, D.R. |author3=Smith, C.R. |author4=Gams, J. |author5=Herbert, M.A. |title=Effect of low level direct current on in vivo tumor growth in hamsters|journal=Cancer Research|year=1985|volume=45|pages=5625–5631}}</ref>
The mechanism for the effectiveness of DC electrotherapy in treating cancer was suggested in an article published in 1997.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Kulsh|first=J.|title=Targeting a key enzyme in cell growth: a novel therapy for cancer|journal=[[Medical Hypotheses]]|year=1997|volume=49|pages=297–300|doi=10.1016/s0306-9877(97)90193-6}}</ref>{{ums|date=November 2017}} The free-radical (unpaired electron) containing active-site of enzyme [[Ribonucleotide reductase|Ribonucleotide Reductase]], RnR—which controls the rate-limiting step in the synthesis of DNA—can be disabled by a stream of passing electrons.

Some of the treatment effectiveness mechanisms are little understood, with effectiveness and best practices for their use still anecdotal.
