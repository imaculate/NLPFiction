{{Protestantism}}
The '''Puritans''' were English [[Protestants]] in the [[Christianity in the 16th century|16th]] and [[Christianity in the 17th century|17th centuries]] who sought to "purify" the [[Church of England]] of [[Roman Catholic]] practices, maintaining that the Church of England had not been fully reformed and needed to become more Protestant.<ref>Julie Spraggon (2003). "Puritan Iconoclasm During the English Civil War". p. 98. Boydell Press</ref> Puritanism played a significant role in [[English history]], especially during the [[The Protectorate|Protectorate]].

Puritans were dissatisfied with the limited extent of the [[English Reformation]] and with the Church of England's toleration of certain practices associated with the Roman Catholic Church. They formed and identified with various religious groups advocating greater purity of [[worship]] and [[doctrine]], as well as personal and corporate [[pietism|piety]]. Puritans adopted a [[Reformed theology]] and, in that sense, were Calvinists (as were many of their earlier opponents). They also took note of radical criticisms of [[Huldrych Zwingli]] in [[Zürich]] and [[John Calvin]] in [[Geneva]]. In church polity, some advocated separation from all other established Christian denominations in favour of autonomous [[gathered church]]es. These [[English Separatists|separatist]] and [[independent (religion)|independent]] strands of Puritanism became prominent in the 1640s, when the supporters of a [[Presbyterian polity]] in the [[Westminster Assembly]] were unable to forge a new English national church.

By the late 1630s, Puritans were in alliance with the growing commercial world, with the parliamentary opposition to the [[royal prerogative]], and with the [[Church of Scotland|Scottish Presbyterians]] with whom they had much in common. Consequently, they became a major political force in England and came to power as a result of the [[First English Civil War]] (1642–1646). Almost all Puritan clergy left the Church of England after the [[Restoration (England)|restoration of the monarchy]] in 1660 and the [[1662 Uniformity Act]]. Many continued to practice their faith in [[nonconformist]] denominations, especially in [[Congregational church|Congregationalist]] and [[Presbyterian]] churches.<ref name="Cliffe2002">{{cite book|last=Cliffe|first=Trevor|title=Puritan Gentry Besieged 1650–1700|date=11 September 2002|publisher=Routledge|language=English |isbn=9781134918157|page=195}}</ref> The nature of the movement in England changed radically, although it retained its character for a much longer period in [[New England]].

Puritanism was never a formally defined religious division within Protestantism, and the term ''Puritan'' itself was rarely used after the turn of the 18th century. Some Puritan ideals, including the formal rejection of Roman Catholicism, were incorporated into the doctrines of the Church of England; others were absorbed into the many Protestant denominations that emerged in the late 17th and early 18th centuries in America and Britain. The Congregational churches, widely considered to be a part of the Reformed tradition, are descended from the Puritans.<ref name="Ph.D.2008">{{cite book|last=Miller|first=Randall M. |title=The Greenwood Encyclopedia of Daily Life in America|date=30 December 2008|publisher=[[ABC-CLIO]]|language=English |isbn=9780313065361|page=296|quote=Congregationalists were theologically descended directly from the Puritans of England and consequently enjoyed pride of place as one of the oldest, most numerous, and most significant religious groups in the colonies.}}</ref><ref>Archpriest John W.

"Non-separating Puritans" were dissatisfied with the [[English Reformation|Reformation of the Church of England]] but remained within it, advocating for further reform; they disagreed among themselves about how much further reformation was possible or even necessary. "Separatists", or "separating Puritans", thought the [[Church of England]] was so corrupt that true Christians should separate from it altogether. In its widest historical sense, the term ''Puritan'' includes both groups.<ref>{{cite book|author=C.

Puritans should not be confused with more radical Protestant groups of the 16th and 17th centuries, such as [[Quakers]], [[Seekers]], and [[Familia Caritatis|Familists]] who believed that individuals could be directly guided by the [[Holy Spirit in Christianity|Holy Spirit]] and prioritized [[direct revelation]] over the [[Bible]].{{Sfn | Spurr | 1998 | p = 7}}

==History==
{{Main|History of the Puritans}}
Puritanism has a historical importance over a period of a century, followed by fifty years of development in New England. It changed character and emphasis almost decade-by-decade over that time.

===Elizabethan Puritanism===
{{details|History of the Puritans under Elizabeth I}}
Elizabethan Puritanism contended with the Elizabethan religious settlement, with little to show for it. The [[Lambeth Articles]] of 1595, a high-water mark for Calvinism within the Church of England, failed to receive royal approval.

===Jacobean Puritanism===
{{details|History of the Puritans under James I}}

The accession of [[James VI and I|James I]] to the English throne brought the [[Millenary Petition]], a Puritan [[manifesto]] of 1603 for reform of the English church, but James wanted a religious settlement along different lines. He called the [[Hampton Court Conference]] in 1604, and heard the teachings of four prominent Puritan leaders, including [[Laurence Chaderton]], but largely sided with his bishops. He was well informed on theological matters by his education and Scottish upbringing, and he dealt shortly with the peevish legacy of Elizabethan Puritanism, pursuing an [[eirenic]] religious policy, in which he was arbiter.

Many of James's episcopal appointments were Calvinists, notably [[James Montague (bishop)|James Montague]], who was an influential courtier. Puritans still opposed much of the [[Anglo-Catholicism|Roman Catholic summation]] in the Church of England, notably the ''Book of Common Prayer'' but also the use of non-secular vestments (cap and gown) during services, the sign of the Cross in baptism, and kneeling to receive Holy Communion.<ref>Neil (1844), [https://books.google.com/books?id=72gPAAAAYAAJ&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_v2_summary_r&cad=0#v=onepage&q=&f=false p. 246] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160504131815/https://books.google.com/books?id=72gPAAAAYAAJ&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_v2_summary_r&cad=0 |date=4 May 2016 }}</ref> Some of the bishops under both Elizabeth and James tried to suppress Puritanism, though other bishops were more tolerant and, in many places, individual ministers were able to omit disliked portions of the ''Book of Common Prayer''.

The Puritan movement of Jacobean times became distinctive by adaptation and compromise, with the emergence of "semi-separatism", "moderate puritanism", the writings of [[William Bradshaw (Puritan)|William Bradshaw]] (who adopted the term "Puritan" for himself), and the beginnings of [[Congregationalist polity|Congregationalism]].<ref>John Spurr, ''English Puritanism, 1603–1689'' (1998), Chapter 5.</ref> Most Puritans of this period were non-separating and remained within the Church of England; Separatists who left the Church of England altogether were numerically much fewer.

===Fragmentation and political failure===
{{details|History of the Puritans from 1649}}
[[File:Assertion of Liberty of Conscience by the Independents of the Westminster Assembly of Divines, 1644.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Westminster Assembly]], which saw disputes on Church polity in England (Victorian history painting by [[John Rogers Herbert]]).]]
The Puritan movement in England was riven over decades by emigration and inconsistent interpretations of Scripture, as well as some political differences that surfaced at that time. [[Fifth Monarchists|The Fifth Monarchy Men]], a radical millenarian wing of Puritanism, aided by strident, popular clergy like [[Vavasor Powell]], agitated from the right wing of the movement, even as sectarian groups like the [[Ranter]]s, [[Levellers]], and [[Quakers]] pulled from the left.<ref>{{cite thesis |type=Ph.D. |first=Michael A. |last=Milton |title=The Application of the Faith of the Westminster Assembly in the Ministry of the Welsh Puritan, Vavasor Powell (1617–1670)|publisher=University of Wales |year=1997}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |type=Print |first=Christopher |last=Hill |title=The World Turned Upside Down; Radical Ideas During the English Revolution|publisher=Viking |year=1972}}</ref> The fragmentation created a collapse of the centre and, ultimately, sealed a political failure, while depositing an enduring spiritual legacy that would remain and grow in English-speaking Christianity.<ref>{{cite book |type=Print |first=Douglas F. |last=Kelly |title=The Emergence of Liberty in the Modern World: The Influence of Calvin on Five Governments from the 16th Through 18th Centuries |publisher=P&R |year=1992}}</ref>

The [[Westminster Assembly]] was called in 1643, assembling clergy of the Church of England. The Assembly was able to agree to the [[Westminster Confession of Faith]] doctrinally, a consistent Reformed theological position. The ''[[Directory of Public Worship]]'' was made official in 1645, and the larger framework (now called the [[Westminster Standards]]) was adopted by the [[Church of Scotland]]. In England, the Standards were contested by Independents up to 1660.<ref name="BenedettoMcKim2010">{{cite book|author1=Robert Benedetto|author2=[[Donald K. McKim]]|title=Historical Dictionary of the Reformed Churches|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=edhZ_g-RvyMC&pg=PA521|accessdate=4 November 2012|year=2010|publisher=Scarecrow Press|isbn=978-0-8108-5807-7|pages=521–2|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130718180452/http://books.google.com/books?id=edhZ_g-RvyMC&pg=PA521|archivedate=18 July 2013|df=dmy-all}}</ref>

The [[List of the Westminster Divines|Westminster Divines]], on the other hand, were divided over questions of [[church polity]] and split into factions supporting a reformed [[episcopal polity|episcopacy]], [[Presbyterian polity|presbyterianism]], [[Congregationalist polity|congregationalism]], and [[Erastianism]]. The membership of the Assembly was heavily weighted towards the Presbyterians, but [[Oliver Cromwell]] was a Puritan and an [[Independent (religion)|independent Congregationalist separatist]] who imposed his doctrines upon them. The Church of England of the [[Interregnum (1649–60)]] was run along Presbyterian lines but never became a national Presbyterian church, such as existed in Scotland, and England was not the theocratic state which leading Puritans had called for as "godly rule".<ref>William M. Lamont, ''Godly Rule: Politics and Religion 1603–60'' (1969).</ref>

{{Anchor|Great Ejection}}

===Great Ejection and Dissenters===
{{details|History of the Puritans from 1649}}
At the time of the [[English Restoration]] in 1660, the [[Savoy Conference]] was called to determine a new religious settlement for England and Wales. Under the [[Act of Uniformity 1662]], the Church of England was restored to its pre-[[English Civil War|Civil War]] constitution with only minor changes, and the Puritans found themselves sidelined.  A traditional estimate of historian [[Edmund Calamy (historian)|Calamy]] is that around 2,400 Puritan clergy left the Church in the "[[Great Ejection]]" of 1662.<ref name = Calamy>{{Cite DNB|wstitle=Calamy, Edmund (1671-1732)|display=Calamy, Edmund (1671–1732) |volume=51 |pages=63–65}}</ref> At this point, the term "[[English Dissenters|Dissenter]]" came to include "Puritan", but more accurately described those (clergy or lay) who "dissented" from the ''[[1662 Book of Common Prayer]]''.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-dvIUPxicf8C&pg=PA196&lpg=PA196&dq=dissenter+described+those+who+%22dissented%22+from+the+1662+Book+of+Common+Prayer&source=bl&ots=cAe7tyvHj2&sig=PWcf7kiI7-JJdgWEYEnmXuvBIs0&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjPvua5oNTdAhUvIjQIHQhTApUQ6AEwCXoECAEQAQ#v=onepage&q=dissenter%20described%20those%20who%20%22dissented%22%20from%20the%201662%20Book%20of%20Common%20Prayer&f=false|title=The Greenian Moment: T.H. Green, Religion and Political Argument in Victorian Britain|last=Leighton|first=Denys|date=2004|publisher=Imprint Academic|isbn=9780907845546|language=en}}</ref>

The Dissenters divided themselves from all Christians in the Church of England and established their own separatist congregations in the 1660s and 1670s. An estimated 1,800 of the ejected clergy continued in some fashion as ministers of religion, according to [[Richard Baxter]].<ref name = Calamy/> The government initially attempted to suppress these schismatic organisations by using the [[Clarendon Code]]. There followed a period in which schemes of "comprehension" were proposed, under which Presbyterians could be brought back into the Church of England, but nothing resulted from them. The [[Whig (British political faction)|Whigs]] opposed the court religious policies and argued that the Dissenters should be allowed to worship separately from the established Church, and this position ultimately prevailed when the [[Act of Toleration 1689|Toleration Act]] was passed in the wake of the [[Glorious Revolution]] in 1689. This permitted the licensing of Dissenting ministers and the building of chapels. The term "[[Nonconformist]]" generally replaced the term "Dissenter" from the middle of the 18th century.

Some [[Puritan migration to New England (1620–40)|Puritans left for New England]], particularly in the years after 1630, supporting the founding of the [[Massachusetts Bay Colony]] and other settlements among the northern colonies. The large-scale Puritan immigration to New England ceased by 1641, with around 21,000 having moved across the Atlantic. This English-speaking population in America did not all consist of original colonists, since many returned to England shortly after arriving on the continent, but it produced more than 16 million descendants.<ref>[[David Hackett Fischer]], ''[[Albion's Seed: Four British Folkways in America]]'' (1989) {{ISBN|0-19-506905-6}}</ref><ref>"[http://academic.brooklyn.cuny.edu/english/melani/english2/puritans_intro.html The Puritans: A Sourcebook of Their Writings] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100116020829/http://academic.brooklyn.cuny.edu/english/melani/english2/puritans_intro.html |date=16 January 2010 }}".

Puritan hegemony lasted for at least a century. That century can be broken down into three parts: the generation of [[John Cotton (minister)|John Cotton]] and [[Richard Mather]], 1630–62 from the founding to the Restoration, years of virtual independence and nearly autonomous development; the generation of [[Increase Mather]], 1662–89 from the Restoration and the Halfway Covenant to the Glorious Revolution, years of struggle with the British crown; and the generation of [[Cotton Mather]], 1689–1728 from the overthrow of [[Edmund Andros]] (in which Cotton Mather played a part) and the new charter, mediated by Increase Mather, to the death of Cotton Mather.<ref>Carpenter, John B.

==Beliefs==
===Calvinism===
{{Calvinism}}
{{Main|Calvinism}}
''Puritanism'' broadly refers to a diverse religious reform movement in Britain committed to the [[continental Reformed]] tradition.<ref>{{cite book | last = Ahlstrom | first = Sydney E. | author-link = Sydney E. Ahlstrom | title = A Religious History of the American People | publisher = [[Yale University Press]] | edition = 2nd | orig-year = 1972 |date = 2004 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=5kFF6a1viGcC&source=gbs_navlinks_s | isbn = 0-385-11164-9 | p = 125 | ref=harv}}</ref> While Puritans did not agree on all doctrinal points, most shared similar views on the nature of [[God in Christianity|God]], human [[sin]]fulness, and the relationship between God and mankind. They believed that all of their beliefs should be based on the [[Bible]], which they considered to be [[Biblical inspiration|divinely inspired]].<ref>{{cite book | last = Bremer | first = Francis J. | author-link = | title = Puritanism: A Very Short Introduction | publisher = [[Oxford University Press]] | series = | volume = | edition = | date = 2009 | location = | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=RDnRCwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false | isbn = 9780199740871 | p = 35 | ref=harv}}</ref>

The concept of [[Covenant (religion)|covenant]] was extremely important to Puritans, and [[covenant theology]] was central to their beliefs. With roots in the writings of Reformed theologians [[John Calvin]] and [[Heinrich Bullinger]], covenant theology was further developed by Puritan theologians [[Dudley Fenner]], [[William Perkins (theologian)|William Perkins]], [[John Preston (priest)|John Preston]], [[Richard Sibbes]], [[William Ames]] and, most fully by Ames's Dutch student, [[Johannes Cocceius]].{{Sfn|Ahlstrom|2004|pp=130–131}} Covenant theology asserts that when God created [[Adam and Eve]] he promised them [[Eternal life (Christianity)|eternal life]] in return for perfect obedience; this promise was termed the covenant of [[Good works|works]]. After the [[fall of man]], human nature was corrupted by [[original sin]] and unable to fulfill the covenant of works, since each person inevitably violated God's law as expressed in the [[Ten Commandments]]. As sinners, every person deserved [[damnation]].{{Sfn|Bremer|2009|pp=37–38}}

Puritans shared with other Calvinists a belief in [[Predestination in Calvinism|double predestination]], that some people (the [[Election (Christianity)|elect]]) were destined by God to receive [[Grace in Christianity|grace]] and [[Salvation in Christianity|salvation]] while others were destined for [[Christian views on Hell|Hell]].{{Sfn|Bremer|2009|p=40}} No one, however, could [[Merit (Christianity)|merit]] salvation. According to covenant theology, [[Crucifixion of Jesus|Christ's sacrifice on the cross]] made possible the covenant of grace, by which those selected by God could be saved. Puritans believed in [[unconditional election]] and [[irresistible grace]]—God's grace was given freely without condition to the elect and could not be refused.{{Sfn|Bremer|2009|p=42}}

===Conversion===
Covenant theology made individual salvation deeply personal. It held that God's predestination was not "impersonal and mechanical" but was a "covenant of grace" that one entered into by [[Faith in Christianity|faith]]. Therefore, being a Christian could never be reduced to simple "intellectual acknowledgment" of the truth of Christianity. Puritans agreed "that the [[effectual call]] of each elect [[Saint#Other Protestantism|saint]] of God would always come as an individuated personal encounter with God's promises".{{Sfn|Ahlstrom|2004|p=131}}

The process by which the elect are brought from [[Spiritual death in Christianity|spiritual death]] to spiritual life ([[Regeneration (theology)|regeneration]]) was described as [[Conversion to Christianity|conversion]].{{Sfn|Bremer|2009|p=42}} Early on, Puritans did not consider a specific conversion experience normative or necessary, but many gained [[assurance of salvation]] from such experiences. Over time, however, Puritan theologians developed a framework for authentic religious experience based on their own experiences as well as those of their parishioners. Eventually, Puritans came to regard a specific conversion experience as an essential mark of one's election.{{Sfn|Ahlstrom|2004|p=132}}

The Puritan conversion experience was commonly described as occurring in discrete phases. It began with a preparatory phase designed to produce [[contrition]] for sin through [[introspection]], [[Bible study (Christian)|Bible study]] and listening to [[preaching]]. This was followed by [[humiliation]], when the sinner realized that he or she was helpless to break free from sin and that their good works could never earn forgiveness.{{Sfn|Bremer|2009|p=42}} It was after reaching this point—the realization that salvation was possible only because of divine [[mercy]]—that the person would experience [[Sola fide|justification]], when the righteousness of Christ is [[Imputed righteousness|imputed]] to the elect and their minds and hearts are regenerated. For some Puritans, this was a dramatic experience and they referred to it as being [[born again]].{{Sfn|Bremer|2009|p=43}}

Confirming that such a conversion had actually happened often required prolonged and continual introspection. Historian [[Perry Miller]] wrote that the Puritans "liberated men from the treadmill of [[indulgence]]s and [[penance]]s, but cast them on the iron couch of introspection".{{Sfn|Ahlstrom|2004|p=128}} It was expected that conversion would be followed by [[sanctification]]—"the progressive growth in the saint's ability to better perceive and seek God's will, and thus to lead a holy life".{{Sfn|Bremer|2009|p=43}} Some Puritans attempted to find assurance of their faith by keeping detailed records of their behavior and looking for the evidence of salvation in their lives. Puritan clergy wrote many spiritual guides to help their parishioners pursue personal [[piety]] and sanctification. These included [[Arthur Dent (Puritan)|Arthur Dent's]] ''The Plain Man's Pathway to Heaven'' (1601), [[Richard Rogers (theologian)|Richard Rogers's]] ''Seven Treatises'' (1603), [[Henry Scudder (priest)|Henry Scudder's]] ''Christian's Daily Walk'' (1627) and Richard Sibbes's ''The Bruised Reed and Smoking Flax'' (1630).{{Sfn|Bremer|2009|p=44}}

Too much emphasis on one's good works could be criticized for being too close to [[Arminianism]], and too much emphasis on subjective religious experience could be criticized as [[Antinomianism]]. Many Puritans relied on both personal religious experience and self-examination to assess their spiritual condition.{{Sfn|Bremer|2009|p=44}}

Puritanism's experiential piety would be inherited by the [[evangelical Protestants]] of the 18th century.{{Sfn|Ahlstrom|2004|p=128}} While evangelical views on conversion were heavily influenced by Puritan theology, the Puritans believed that assurance of one's salvation was "rare, late and the fruit of struggle in the experience of believers", whereas evangelicals believed that assurance was normative for all the truly converted.<ref>{{Citation|last=Bebbington|first=David W|title=Evangelicalism in Modern Britain: A History from the 1730s to the 1980s|year=1993| publisher=Routledge | location=London | p = 43 | ref=harv}}</ref>

The sermon was not only a means of religious education; Puritans believed it was the most common way that God prepared a sinner's heart for conversion.{{Sfn|Bremer|2009|p=59}} Puritans eliminated [[choral music]] and [[Musical instruments in church services|musical instruments]] in their religious services because these were associated with Roman Catholicism; however, [[Musical setting|setting]]s of the [[Psalms]] were considered appropriate.{{Sfn|Bremer|2009|p=65}} [[Church organ]]s were commonly damaged or destroyed in the Civil War period, such as when an axe was taken to the organ of [[Worcester Cathedral]] in 1642.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.worcestercathedral.co.uk/index.php?pr=The_Civil_War |title=Worcester Cathedral welcomes you to their Website |publisher=Worcestercathedral.co.uk |date=20 February 2010 |accessdate=21 August 2010 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100823022433/http://www.worcestercathedral.co.uk/index.php?pr=The_Civil_War |archivedate=23 August 2010 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> Puritans taught that there were two [[sacrament]]s: [[Reformed baptismal theology|baptism]] and the [[Lord's Supper in Reformed theology|Lord's Supper]].

Puritans unanimously rejected the Roman Catholic doctrine of [[baptismal regeneration]], but they disagreed among themselves on the effects of baptism and its relationship to regeneration. Most Puritans practiced [[infant baptism]], but a minority held [[credobaptist]] beliefs. Those who baptized infants understood it through the lens of covenant theology, believing that baptism had replaced [[Religious male circumcision|circumcision]] as a sign of the covenant and marked a child's admission into the [[visible church]]. In "A Discourse on the Nature of Regeneration", [[Stephen Charnock]] distinguished regeneration from "external baptism" writing that baptism "confers not grace" but rather is a means of conveying the grace of regeneration only "when the [Holy] Spirit is pleased to operate with it". Therefore, one cannot assume that baptism produces regeneration. The Westminster Confession states that the grace of baptism is only effective for those who are among the elect; however, its effects are not tied to the moment of baptism but lies dormant until one experiences conversion later in life.<ref>{{cite book | last1 = Beeke | first1 = Joel R. | last2 = Jones | first2 = Mark | title = A Puritan Theology: Doctrine for Life | publisher = Reformation Heritage Books | edition = [[Amazon Kindle]] | date = 2012 | location = "Regeneration and Baptism", location 18043–18056 | url = | isbn = 978-1-60178-166-6 | ref=harv}}</ref>

Puritans rejected both Roman Catholic ([[transubstantiation]]) and Lutheran ([[sacramental union]]) teachings that Christ is physically present in the [[Sacramental bread|bread]] and [[Sacramental wine|wine]] of the Lord's Supper. Instead, Puritans embraced the Reformed doctrine of real spiritual presence, believing that in the Lord's Supper the faithful receive Christ spiritually. In agreement with [[Thomas Cranmer]], the Puritans stressed "that Christ comes down to us in the sacrament by His Word and Spirit, offering Himself as our spiritual food and drink".{{Sfn|Beeke|Jones|2012|loc="The True Meaning of the Lord's Supper", [[Amazon Kindle]] location 28097–28107}}

===Ecclesiology===
While the Puritans were united in their goal of furthering the English Reformation, they were always divided over issues of [[ecclesiology]] and [[church polity]], specifically questions relating to the manner of organizing congregations, how individual congregations should relate with one another and whether [[Christian state|established national churches]] were scriptural.{{Sfn|Ahlstrom|2004|p=132}} On these questions, Puritans divided between supporters of [[episcopal polity]], [[presbyterian polity]] and [[congregational polity]].

The episcopalians (known as the [[Prelate|prelatical]] party) were conservatives who supported retaining [[bishop]]s if those leaders supported reform and agreed to share power with local churches.{{Sfn|Bremer|2009|p=69}} They also supported the idea of having a [[Book of Common Prayer]], but they were against demanding strict conformity or having too much ceremony. In addition, these Puritans called for a renewal of preaching, [[pastoral care]] and Christian [[Church discipline|discipline]] within the Church of England.{{Sfn|Ahlstrom|2004|p=132}}

Like the episcopalians, the presbyterians agreed that there should be a national church but one structured on the model of the [[Church of Scotland]].{{Sfn|Bremer|2009|p=69}} They wanted to replace bishops with a system of elective and representative governing bodies of clergy and [[laity]] (local [[Session (Presbyterianism)|sessions]], [[Consistory (Protestantism)#Reformed usage|presbyteries]], [[synod]]s, and ultimately a national [[General Assembly (presbyterian church)|general assembly]]).{{Sfn|Ahlstrom|2004|p=132}} During the [[Interregnum (England)|Interregnum]], the presbyterians had limited success at reorganizing the Church of England. The [[Westminster Assembly]] proposed the creation of a presbyterian system, but the [[Long Parliament]] left implementation to local authorities. As a result, the Church of England never developed a complete presbyterian hierarchy.{{Sfn|Bremer|2009|p=72}}

Congregationalists or Independents believed in the autonomy of the local church, which ideally would be a congregation of "visible saints" (meaning those who had experienced conversion).{{Sfn|Ahlstrom|2004|pp=132–133}} Members would be required to abide by a [[church covenant]], in which they "pledged to join in the proper worship of God and to nourish each other in the search for further religious truth".{{Sfn|Bremer|2009|p=69}} Such churches were regarded as complete within themselves, with full authority to determine their own membership, administer their own discipline and ordain their own ministers. Furthermore, the sacraments would only be administered to those in the church covenant.{{Sfn|Ahlstrom|2004|p=133}}

Most congregational Puritans remained within the Church of England, hoping to reform it according to their own views. The [[Congregationalism in the United States|New England Congregationalists]] were also adamant that they were not separating from the Church of England. However, some Puritans equated the Church of England with the Roman Catholic Church, and therefore considered it no Christian church at all. These groups, such as the [[Brownist]]s, would split from the established church and become known as Separatists. Other Separatists embraced more radical positions on [[separation of church and state]] and [[believer's baptism]], becoming early [[Baptists]].{{Sfn|Ahlstrom|2004|p=133}}

===Family life===
[[File:The Snake in the Grass or Satan Transform'd to an Angel of Light.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.1|''The Snake in the Grass or Satan Transform'd to an Angel of Light'', title page engraved by [[Richard Gaywood]], ca. 1660]]
Based on Biblical portrayals of Adam and Eve, Puritans believed that marriage was rooted in procreation, love, and, most importantly, salvation.<ref>{{cite book|last=Porterfield|first=Amanda|title=Female Piety in Puritan New England the Emergence of Religious Humanism|year=1992|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York|page=82}}</ref> Husbands were the spiritual heads of the household, while women were to demonstrate religious piety and obedience under male authority.<ref>{{cite book|last=Norton|first=Mary Beth|title=Separated by Their Sex: Women in Public and Private in the Colonial Atlantic World|year=2011|publisher=Cornell University Press|location=Ithaca|page=91}}</ref> Furthermore, marriage represented not only the relationship between husband and wife, but also the relationship between spouses and God. Puritan husbands commanded authority through family direction and prayer. The female relationship to her husband and to God was marked by submissiveness and humility.<ref>{{cite book|last=Porterfield|first=Amanda|title=Female Piety in Puritan New England the Emergence of Religious Humanism|year=1992|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York|page=81}}</ref>

[[Thomas Gataker]] describes Puritan marriage as:

{{quote|... together for a time as copartners in grace here, [that] they may reigne together forever as coheires in glory hereafter.<ref>{{cite book|last=Johnson|first=James Turner|title=A Society Ordained by God|year=1970|publisher=Abingdon Press|location=Nashville|page=93}}</ref>}}

The paradox created by female inferiority in the public sphere and the spiritual equality of men and women in marriage, then, gave way to the informal authority of women concerning matters of the home and childrearing.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Ulrich|first=Laurel Thatcher|title=Vertuous Women Found: New England Ministerial Literature, 1668–1735|journal=American Quarterly|year=1976|volume=28.1|page=37|doi=10.2307/2712475|url=https://dash.harvard.edu/bitstream/handle/1/14123819/Vertuous%20Women%20Found.pdf?sequence=1}}</ref> With the consent of their husbands, wives made important decisions concerning the labour of their children, property, and the management of inns and taverns owned by their husbands.<ref>{{cite book|last=Demos|first=John|title=A Little Commonwealth; Family Life in Plymouth Colony|year=1970|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York}}</ref> Pious Puritan mothers laboured for their children's righteousness and salvation, connecting women directly to matters of religion and morality.<ref name="Saxton 2003 82">{{cite book|last=Saxton|first=Martha|title=Being Good: Women's Moral Values in Early America|year=2003|publisher=Hill and Wang|location=New York|page=82}}</ref> In her poem titled "In Reference to her Children", poet [[Anne Bradstreet]] reflects on her role as a mother:

{{quote|I had eight birds hatched in one nest; Four cocks there were, and hens the rest. I nursed them up with pain and care, Nor cost nor labour I did spare.}}

Bradstreet alludes to the [[temporality]] of motherhood by comparing her children to a flock of birds on the precipice of leaving home. While Puritans praised the obedience of young children, they also believed that, by separating children from their mothers at adolescence, children could better sustain a superior relationship with God.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Ulrich|first=Laurel Thatcher|title=Vertuous Women Found: New England Ministerial Literature 1668–1735|journal=American Quarterly|year=1976|volume=28.1|page=35|doi=10.2307/2712475}}</ref> A child could only be redeemed through religious education and obedience. Girls carried the additional burden of Eve's corruption and were [[Catechesis|catechised]] separately from boys at adolescence. Boys' education prepared them for vocations and leadership roles, while girls were educated for domestic and religious purposes. The pinnacle of achievement for children in Puritan society, however, occurred with the conversion process.<ref name="Saxton 2003 82"/>

Puritans viewed the relationship between master and servant similarly to that of parent and child. Just as parents were expected to uphold Puritan religious values in the home, masters assumed the parental responsibility of housing and educating young servants. Older servants also dwelt with masters and were cared for in the event of illness or injury. African-American and Indian servants were likely excluded from such benefits.<ref>{{cite book|last=Demos|first=John|title=A Little Commonwealth; Family Life in Plymouth Colony|year=1970|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York|pages=107–117}}</ref>

===Demonology and witch hunts===
{{Further|Christian demonology}}
Like most Christians in the [[early modern period]], Puritans believed in the active existence of the [[Devil in Christianity|devil]] and [[demon]]s as evil forces that could possess and cause harm to men and women. There was also widespread belief in [[European witchcraft|witchcraft]] and witches—persons in league with the devil. "Unexplained phenomena such as the death of livestock, human disease, and hideous fits suffered by young and old" might all be blamed on the agency of the devil or a witch.{{Sfn|Bremer|2009|p=30}}

Puritan pastors undertook [[Exorcism in Christianity|exorcisms]] for [[demonic possession]] in some high-profile cases. Exorcist [[John Darrell]] was supported by [[Arthur Hildersham]] in the case of Thomas Darling.<ref>Francis J. Bremer, Tom Webster, ''Puritans and Puritanism in Europe and America: A Comprehensive Encyclopedia'' (2006), p. 584.</ref> [[Samuel Harsnett]], a skeptic on witchcraft and possession, attacked Darrell. However, Harsnett was in the minority, and many clergy, not only Puritans, believed in witchcraft and possession.<ref>{{Cite DNB|wstitle=Scott, Reginald|display=Scott, Reginald}}</ref>

In the 16th and 17th centuries, thousands of people throughout Europe were accused of being witches and executed. In England and America, Puritans engaged in [[witch hunt]]s as well. In the 1640s, [[Matthew Hopkins]], the self-proclaimed "Witchfinder General", was responsible for accusing over two hundred people of witchcraft, mainly in East Anglia. In New England, few people were accused and convicted of witchcraft before 1692; there were at most sixteen convictions.{{Sfn|Bremer|2009|pp=31–32}}

The [[Salem witch trials]] of 1692 had a lasting impact on the historical reputation of New England Puritans. Though this witch hunt occurred after Puritans lost political control of the [[Province of Massachusetts Bay|Massachusetts colony]], Puritans instigated the judicial proceedings against the accused and comprised the members of the court that convicted and sentenced the accused. By the time Governor [[William Phips]] ended the trials, fourteen women and five men had been hanged as witches.{{Sfn|Bremer|2009|pp=30–32}}

===Millennialism===
{{See|Christian eschatology}}
Puritan [[millennialism]] has been placed in the broader context of European Reformed beliefs about the millennium and interpretation of [[biblical prophecy]], for which representative figures of the period were [[Johannes Piscator]], [[Thomas Brightman]], [[Joseph Mede]], [[Johannes Heinrich Alsted]], and [[John Amos Comenius]].<ref>Howard Hotson, ''Paradise Postponed: Johann Heinrich Alsted and the Birth of Calvinist Millenarianism'' (2001), p. 173.</ref> Like most English Protestants of the time, Puritans based their eschatological views on an [[Historicism (Christianity)|historicist]] interpretation of the [[Book of Revelation]] and the [[Book of Daniel]]. Protestant theologians identified the sequential phases the world must pass through before the [[Last Judgment]] could occur and tended to place their own time period near the end. It was expected that tribulation and persecution would increase but eventually the church's enemies—the [[Antichrist]] (identified with the Roman Catholic Church) and the [[Ottoman Empire]]—would be defeated.<ref>{{cite journal | last = Maclear | first = J. F. | author-link = | title = New England and the Fifth Monarchy: The Quest for the Millennium in Early American Puritanism | journal = The William and Mary Quarterly | volume = 32 | issue = 2 | pages = 225–226 | publisher = Omohundro Institute of Early American History and Culture | date = April 1975 | language = | jstor = 1921563 | ref=harv}}</ref> Based on [[Revelation 20]], it was believed that a thousand year period (the millennium) would occur, during which the saints would rule with Christ on earth.{{Sfn|Bremer|2009|p=76}}

In contrast to other Protestants who tended to view eschatology as an explanation for "God's remote plans for the world and man", Puritans understood it to describe "the cosmic environment in which the regenerate soldier of Christ was now to do battle against the power of sin".{{Sfn|Maclear|1975|p=226}} On a personal level, eschatology was related to sanctification, assurance of salvation, and the conversion experience. On a larger level, eschatology was the lens through which events such as the English Civil War and the [[Thirty Years' War]] were interpreted. There was also an optimistic aspect to Puritan millennianism; Puritans anticipated a future worldwide religious revival before the [[Second Coming]] of Christ.{{Sfn|Maclear|1975|p=227}}{{Sfn|Bremer|2009|p=76}} Another departure from other Protestants was the widespread belief among Puritans that the [[conversion of the Jews]] to Christianity was an important sign of the [[Apocalypticism|apocalypse]].{{Sfn|Maclear|1975|p=229}}

{{Technical|section|date=June 2018}}
David Brady describes a "lull before the storm"{{Explain|date=June 2018}} in the early 17th century, in which "reasonably restrained and systematic" Protestant exegesis of the Book of Revelation was seen with Brightman, Mede, and [[Hugh Broughton]], after which "apocalyptic literature became too easily debased" as it became more populist and less scholarly.<ref>David Brady, ''The Contribution of British Writers Between 1560 and 1830 to the Interpretation of Revelation 13.16–18'' (1983), p. 58.</ref>{{Explain|date=June 2018}} William Lamont argues that, within the church, the Elizabethan [[millennial beliefs of John Foxe]] became sidelined, with Puritans adopting instead the "centrifugal" doctrines of Thomas Brightman, while the Laudians replaced the "centripetal" attitude of Foxe to the "Christian Emperor" by the national and episcopal Church closer to home, with its royal head, as leading the Protestant world ''iure divino'' (by divine right).<ref name= Lamont>William M.

{{details|New England Puritan culture and recreation}}

Some strong religious beliefs common to Puritans had direct impacts on culture. Education was essential to every person, male and female, so that they could read the Bible for themselves. However, the Puritans' emphasis on individual spiritual independence was not always compatible with the community cohesion that was also a strong ideal.<ref>Joseph Watras, "Education and evangelism in the English colonies." ''American Educational History Journal'' 35.1/2 (2008): 205–219.</ref> [[Anne Hutchinson]] (1591–1643), the well educated daughter of a teacher, argued with the established theological orthodoxy, and was forced to leave the colony with her followers.<ref>Francis J.

=== Education ===
{{See|History of education in the United States}}
[[File:Cotton Mather.jpg|thumb|right|[[Cotton Mather]], influential New England Puritan minister, portrait by [[Peter Pelham]].]]
At a time when the literacy rate in England was less than 30 percent, the Puritan leaders of colonial New England believed children should be educated for both religious and civil reasons, and they worked to achieve universal literacy.<ref>James Axtell, ''The School upon a Hill: Education and Society in Colonial New England'' (1976)</ref> In 1642, Massachusetts required heads of households to teach their wives, children and servants basic reading and writing so that they could read the Bible and understand colonial laws. In 1647, the government required all towns with 50 or more households to hire a teacher and towns of 100 or more households to hire a [[grammar school]] instructor to prepare promising boys for college. Boys interested in the ministry were often sent to colleges such as [[Harvard University|Harvard]] (founded in 1636) or [[Yale University|Yale]] (founded in 1707).{{Sfn|Bremer|2009|pp=81–82}} Aspiring lawyers or doctors apprenticed to a local practitioner, or in rare cases were sent to England or Scotland.<ref>{{cite book|author=Peter James Marshall|title=The Making and Unmaking of Empires: Britain, India, and America C.1750–1783|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=O-c41Ftn8yoC&pg=PA30|year=2005|page=30}}</ref>

The [[Merton Thesis]] is an argument about the nature of early [[experimental science]] proposed by [[Robert K. Merton]]. Similar to [[Max Weber]]'s [[The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism|famous claim]] on the link between the [[Protestant work ethic]] and the [[capitalist economy]], Merton argued for a similar positive [[correlation]] between the rise of English Puritanism, as well as German [[Pietism]], and early experimental science.<ref name="sztompka2003">Sztompka, 2003</ref> As an example, seven of 10 nucleus members of the [[Royal Society]] were Puritans.

Puritans were opposed to Sunday sport or recreation because these distracted from religious observance of the [[Puritan Sabbatarianism|Sabbath]].{{Sfn|Bremer|2009|p=79}} Other forms of leisure and entertainment were completely forbidden on moral grounds. For example, Puritans were universally opposed to [[blood sport]]s such as [[bearbaiting]] and [[cockfighting]] because they involved unnecessary injury to God's creatures. For similar reasons, they also opposed [[boxing]].{{Sfn|Bremer|2009|p=59}} These sports were illegal in England during Puritan rule.{{Sfn|Bremer|2009|p=80}}

Puritans condemned the [[sexualization]] of the theatre and its associations with depravity and prostitution—London's theatres were located on the south side of the [[Thames]], which was a center of prostitution. A major Puritan attack on the theatre was [[William Prynne]]'s book ''[[Histriomastix]]''. Puritan authorities shut down English theatres in the 1640s and 1650s, and none were allowed to open in Puritan-controlled colonies.<ref>N. H. Keeble, ''The Literary Culture of Nonconformity in Later Seventeenth-Century England'' (1987), p. 153.</ref>{{Sfn|Bremer|2009|p=58}}

Puritans were not opposed to drinking alcohol in moderation.<ref>West (2003) pp. 68ff</ref> However, alehouses were closely regulated by Puritan-controlled governments in both England and America.{{Sfn|Bremer|2009|p=79}} Early New England laws banning the sale of alcohol to Native Americans were criticised because it was "not fit to deprive Indians of any lawfull comfort aloweth to all men by the use of wine". Laws banned the practice of individuals toasting each other, with the explanation that it led to wasting God's gift of beer and wine, as well as being carnal.

Bounds were not set on enjoying sexuality within the bounds of marriage, as a gift from God.<ref>Lewis (1969), pp. 116–117. "On many questions and specially in view of the marriage bed, the Puritans were the indulgent party, ... they were much more [[G. K.

===Opposition to other religious views===
[[File:Mary dyer being led.jpg|thumb|Quaker [[Mary Dyer]] led to execution on [[Boston Common]], 1 June 1660, by an unknown 19th century artist]]
The Puritans exhibited intolerance to other religious views, including [[Quaker]], [[Church of England|Anglican]] and [[Baptist]] theologies.

==Historiography==
[[File:WLA amart The Puritan ca 1899 Augustus Saint-Gaudens.jpg|thumb|A copy of [[The Puritan (Springfield, Massachusetts)|''The Puritan'']], a late 19th-century sculpture by [[Augustus Saint-Gaudens]].]]
The literature on Puritans, particularly biographical literature on individual Puritan ministers, was already voluminous in the 17th century and, indeed, the interests of Puritans in the narratives of early life and conversions made the recording of the internal lives important to them. The historical literature on Puritans is, however, quite problematic and subject to controversies over interpretation. The early writings are those of the defeated, excluded and victims. The great interest of authors of the 19th century in Puritan figures was routinely accused in the 20th century of consisting of [[anachronism]] and the reading back of contemporary concerns.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}

A debate continues on the definition of "Puritanism".<ref name="Bremer2009">{{cite book|author=Francis J. Bremer|title=Puritanism: A Very Short Introduction|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mb7c68hAwKEC&pg=PA2|accessdate=9 November 2012|date=24 July 2009|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-533455-5|page=2|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130718231557/http://books.google.com/books?id=mb7c68hAwKEC&pg=PA2|archivedate=18 July 2013|df=dmy-all}}</ref> English historian [[Patrick Collinson]] believes that "Puritanism had no content beyond what was attributed to it by its opponents."<ref>Spurr (1998), p. 16; cites and quotes [[Patrick Collinson]] (1989). ''The Puritan Character'', p. 8.</ref> The analysis of "mainstream Puritanism" in terms of the evolution from it of Separatist and [[antinomian]] groups that did not flourish, and others that continue to this day, such as [[Baptists]] and [[Quakers]], can suffer in this way. The national context (England and Wales, as well as the kingdoms of Scotland and Ireland) frames the definition of Puritans, but was not a self-identification for those Protestants who saw the progress of the [[Thirty Years' War]] from 1620 as directly bearing on their denomination, and as a continuation of the religious wars of the previous century, carried on by the English Civil Wars. English historian [[Christopher Hill (historian)|Christopher Hill]], who has contributed to analyses of Puritan concerns that are more respected than accepted, writes of the 1630s, old church lands, and the accusations that [[William Laud]] was a crypto-Catholic:

{{quote|To the heightened Puritan imagination it seemed that, all over Europe, the lamps were going out: the [[Counter-Reformation]] was winning back property for the [[Catholic Church|church]] as well as souls: and Charles I and his government, if not allied to the forces of the Counter-Reformation, at least appeared to have set themselves identical economic and political objectives.<ref>[[Christopher Hill (historian)|Christopher Hill]], ''Economic Problems of the Church'' (1971), p. 337.</ref>}}

Puritans were politically important in England, but it is debated whether the movement was in any way a party with policies and leaders before the early 1640s. While Puritanism in New England was important culturally for a group of colonial pioneers in America, there have been many studies trying to pin down exactly what the identifiable cultural component was. Fundamentally, historians remain dissatisfied with the grouping as "Puritan" as a working concept for historical explanation. The conception of a [[Protestant work ethic]], identified more closely with Calvinist or Puritan principles, has been criticised at its root,{{by whom|date=October 2014}} mainly as a ''[[post hoc ergo propter hoc]]'' fallacy aligning economic success with a narrow religious scheme.
