A 400-entry supplement appeared in 2002.<ref name="FritzeCoutts2004">{{cite book|author1=Ronald H. Fritze|author2=Brian E.

The ANB bills itself as the successor of the ''[[Dictionary of American Biography]]'', which was first published between 1926 and 1937. It is not, however, a strict [[superset]] of this older publication; the selection of topics was made anew.<ref name="Thomas2005">{{cite book|author=Keith Thomas|title=Changing conceptions of national biography: the Oxford DNB in historical perspective|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-67118-7|page=35|year=2005}}</ref>

It is commonly available in the reference sections of United States libraries,<ref>{{OCLC|39182280}}</ref><ref name="WinklerMetherell2011">{{cite book|author1=Anthony C. Winkler|author2=Jo Ray Metherell|title=Writing the Research Paper: A Handbook|year=2011|publisher=Cengage Learning|isbn=978-0-495-79964-1|page=24}}</ref> and is available online by subscription (see external links).
