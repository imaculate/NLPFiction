The recorded [[history of Manchester]] began with the civilian settlement associated with the [[Roman Britain|Roman]] [[castra|fort]] of ''Mamucium'' or ''Mancunium'', which was established in about AD 79 on a sandstone bluff near the confluence of the rivers [[River Medlock|Medlock]] and [[River Irwell|Irwell]]. It was [[Historic counties of England|historically]] a part of [[Lancashire]], although areas of [[Cheshire]] south of the [[River Mersey]] were incorporated in the 20th century. The first to be included, [[Wythenshawe]], was added to the city in 1931. Throughout the [[Middle Ages]] Manchester remained a [[manorialism|manorial]] [[Township (England)|township]], but began to expand "at an astonishing rate" around the turn of the 19th century. Manchester's unplanned urbanisation was brought on by a boom in [[textile manufacture during the Industrial Revolution]],<ref name="Cotton">{{cite book|title=The Cotton Industry|last=Aspin|first=Chris|publisher=Shire Publications Ltd|year=1981|isbn=0-85263-545-1|page=3}}</ref> and resulted in it becoming the world's first industrialised city.<ref name="Industrial city">{{cite book|title=Manchester: A History| last=Kidd|first=Alan|year=2006|publisher=Carnegie Publishing| location=Lancaster|isbn=1-85936-128-5}}<br />• {{cite book|title=Tradition in Action.

Manchester achieved city status in 1853. The [[Manchester Ship Canal]] opened in 1894, creating the [[Port of Manchester]] and directly linking the city to the [[Irish Sea]], {{convert|36|mi|km}} to the west. Its fortune declined after the [[Second World War]], owing to [[deindustrialisation]], but the [[Provisional IRA|IRA]] [[1996 Manchester bombing|bombing in 1996]] led to extensive investment and regeneration.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/news/greater-manchester-news/manchester-ira-bomb-20-years-11433239 |title=Recap: The IRA bomb in Manchester... what happened on June 15, 1996 |first=Jennifer |last=Williams |date=15 June 2016 |publisher= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160817001934/http://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/news/greater-manchester-news/manchester-ira-bomb-20-years-11433239 |archivedate=17 August 2016 |df= }}</ref>

=={{anchor|Etymology}} Name==
The name Manchester originates from the [[Latin]] name ''Mamucium'' or its variant ''Mancunium'' and the citizens are still referred to as Mancunians ({{IPAc-en|m|æ|n|ˈ|k|juː|n|i|ə|n}}). These are generally thought to represent a [[Latinization of names|Latinisation]] of an original [[Common Brittonic|Brittonic]] [[Celtic placenames|name]], either from ''mamm-'' ("[[breast]]", in reference to a "[[breast-like hill]]") or from ''mamma'' ("[[mother]]", in reference to a [[River Medlock|local river]] [[Celtic mythology|goddess]]). Both meanings are preserved in [[Insular Celtic languages]], such as ''mam'' meaning "breast" in [[Irish Gaelic|Irish]] and "mother" in Welsh.<ref>The Antiquaries Journal ({{ISSN|0003-5815}}) 2004, vol. 84, pp. 353–357</ref> The [[suffix]] -chester is a survival of [[Old English]] ''ceaster'' and from that ''castra'' in latin for camp or settlement ("fort; fortified town").<ref name="Place names">{{cite book|title=A Dictionary of British Place-Names|url=http://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/acref/9780199609086.001.0001/acref-9780199609086|last=Mills|first=A.D.|year=2003|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|isbn=0-19-852758-6|accessdate=7 November 2013}}</ref>

=== Early history ===
{{main|Mamucium}}

During the [[English Civil War]] Manchester strongly favoured the Parliamentary interest. Although not long-lasting, [[Oliver Cromwell|Cromwell]] granted it the right to elect its own [[Members of Parliament|MP]]. [[Charles Worsley]], who sat for the city for only a year, was later appointed Major General for Lancashire, Cheshire and Staffordshire during the [[Rule of the Major Generals]]. He was a diligent [[puritan]], turning out ale houses and banning the celebration of Christmas; he died in 1656.<ref>{{cite book | title= Cromwell's major generals: godly government during the English Revolution | series= Politics, culture, and society in early modern Britain | author=Durston, Christopher | year= 2001 | publisher=Manchester University Press | location= Manchester | isbn= 0-7190-6065-6 | url= https://books.google.com/?id=Hw622QZHTcYC&pg=PA86&lpg=PA86&dq=%22charles+worsley%22 | accessdate=5 May 2009}}</ref>

Significant quantities of cotton began to be used after about 1600, firstly in linen/cotton [[fustian]]s, but by around 1750 pure cotton fabrics were being produced and cotton had overtaken wool in importance.<ref name="Kidd"/> The Irwell and Mersey were made navigable by 1736, opening a route from Manchester to the sea docks on the Mersey. The [[Bridgewater Canal]], Britain's first wholly artificial waterway, was opened in 1761, bringing coal from mines at [[Worsley]] to central Manchester. The canal was extended to the Mersey at [[Runcorn]] by 1776. The combination of competition and improved efficiency halved the cost of coal and halved the transport cost of raw cotton.<ref name="Kidd"/><ref name="Hartwell"/> Manchester became the dominant marketplace for textiles produced in the surrounding towns.<ref name="Kidd"/> A [[commodities exchange]], opened in 1729,<ref name="Hylton"/> and numerous large warehouses, aided commerce.

=== Industrial Revolution ===
Manchester's history is concerned with [[textile manufacture during the Industrial Revolution]]. The great majority of [[Spinning (textiles)|cotton spinning]] took place in the towns of south Lancashire and north Cheshire, and Manchester was for a time the most productive centre of cotton processing,<ref name="GMArch">{{cite book|author=McNeil, Robina|author2=Michael Nevell|title=A Guide to the Industrial Archaeology of Greater Manchester|publisher=Association for Industrial Archaeology|year=2000|isbn=0-9528930-3-7}}</ref> and later the world's largest marketplace for cotton goods.<ref name="Kidd"/><ref name=Hall>{{cite book | last = Hall | first = Peter | title = Cities in Civilisation | publisher=Weidenfeld & Nicolson | location = London | year = 1998 | isbn = 0-297-84219-6 | chapter = The first industrial city: Manchester 1760–1830}}</ref> Manchester was dubbed "[[Cottonopolis]]" and "Warehouse City" during the [[Victorian era]].<ref name="GMArch"/> In Australia, New Zealand and South Africa, the term "manchester" is still used for household linen: sheets, pillow cases, towels, etc.<ref name="OED">{{cite encyclopedia | title=Manchester | encyclopaedia=Oxford English Dictionary |date=March 2016 | url = https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/manchester | accessdate=17 December 2016 | location=Oxford | publisher=Oxford University Press}}</ref> The industrial revolution brought about huge change in Manchester and was key to the increase in Manchester's population.

Manchester began expanding "at an astonishing rate" around the turn of the 19th century as people flocked to the city for work from Scotland, Wales, Ireland and other areas of England as part of a process of unplanned urbanisation brought on by the [[Industrial Revolution]].<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.timelines.tv/index.php?t=0&e=12# | title = Timelines.tv Urban Slums | publisher = Timelines.tv | accessdate = 2 February 2012 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20120218092606/http://www.timelines.tv/index.php?t=0&e=12 | archive-date = 18 February 2012 | dead-url = yes | df = dmy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/manchester/content/articles/2007/10/03/031007_migrant_history_manchester_feature.shtml|title=Manchester: migrant city|last=Schofield|first=Jonathan|work=BBC Manchester:New Kids From The Bloc|publisher=BBC|accessdate=6 April 2013}}</ref><ref name=autogenerated1>{{cite book|title=The Cotton Industry|last=Aspin|first=Chris|publisher=Shire Publications|location=Aylesbury|year=1981|isbn=0-85263-545-1|page=3}}</ref> It developed a wide range of industries, so that by 1835 "Manchester was without challenge the first and greatest industrial city in the world."<ref name=Hall/> Engineering firms initially made machines for the cotton trade, but diversified into general manufacture. Similarly, the chemical industry started by producing bleaches and dyes, but expanded into other areas. Commerce was supported by financial service industries such as banking and insurance.{{multiple image

}} Trade, and feeding the growing population, required a large transport and distribution infrastructure: the canal system was extended, and Manchester became one end of the world's first intercity passenger railway—the [[Liverpool and Manchester Railway]]. Competition between the various forms of transport kept costs down.<ref name="Kidd"/> In 1878 the [[Post Office (United Kingdom)|GPO]] (the forerunner of [[BT Group|British Telecom]]) provided its first telephones to a firm in Manchester.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.btplc.com/thegroup/btshistory/1605to1880/1878.htm|title=Events in Telecommunications History|accessdate=13 March 2015|publisher=BT Archives|year=1878}}</ref>

The [[Manchester Ship Canal]] was built between 1888 and 1894, in some sections by canalisation of the Rivers Irwell and Mersey, running {{convert|36|mi|km|0}}<ref>{{cite web|url=http://peelports.com/ports/manchester/about-us|title=About Us|publisher=Peel Ports|accessdate=16 March 2015}}</ref> from [[Salford, Greater Manchester|Salford]] to Eastham Locks on the tidal Mersey. This enabled oceangoing ships to sail right into the Port of Manchester. On the canal's banks, just outside the borough, the world's first industrial estate was created at [[Trafford Park]].<ref name="Kidd"/><!--1993, p103 --> Large quantities of machinery, including cotton processing plant, were exported around the world.

A centre of capitalism, Manchester was once the scene of bread and labour riots, as well as calls for greater political recognition by the city's working and non-titled classes. One such gathering ended with the [[Peterloo Massacre]] of 16 August 1819. The economic school of [[Manchester capitalism]] developed there, and Manchester was the centre of the [[Anti-Corn Law League]] from 1838 onward.

Manchester has a notable place in the history of [[Marxism]] and left-wing politics; being the subject of [[Friedrich Engels]]' work ''[[The Condition of the Working Class in England in 1844]]''; Engels spent much of his life in and around Manchester,<ref name="Engles">{{cite web|url=http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/bio/engels/en-1893.htm|title=Marx-Engels Internet Archive – Biography of Engels|accessdate=5 May 2009|publisher=Marx/Engels Biography Archive|year=1893}}</ref> and when [[Karl Marx]] visited Manchester, they met at Chetham's Library. The economics books Marx was reading at the time can be seen in the library, as can the window seat where Marx and Engels would meet.<ref name="Nicholls2004P20"/> The first [[Trades Union Congress]] was held in Manchester (at the Mechanics' Institute, David Street), from 2 to 6 June 1868. Manchester was an important cradle of the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] and the [[Suffragette]] Movement.<ref>{{cite book|title=Manchester: A history|last=Kidd|first=Alan|year=2006|chapter=Chapter 9 England Arise!

At that time, it seemed a place in which anything could happen—new industrial processes, new ways of thinking (the [[Manchester capitalism|Manchester School]], promoting [[free trade]] and ''[[laissez-faire]]''), new classes or groups in society, new religious sects, and new forms of labour organisation. It attracted educated visitors from all parts of Britain and Europe.

Many of the great public buildings (including [[Manchester Town Hall]]) date from then. The city's cosmopolitan atmosphere contributed to a vibrant culture, which included the [[Hallé Orchestra]]. In 1889, when county councils were created in England, the municipal borough became a [[county borough]] with even greater autonomy.

Although the Industrial Revolution brought wealth to the city, it also brought poverty and squalor to a large part of the population. Historian [[Simon Schama]] noted that "Manchester was the very best and the very worst taken to terrifying extremes, a new kind of city in the world; the chimneys of industrial suburbs greeting you with columns of smoke". An American visitor taken to Manchester's blackspots saw "wretched, defrauded, oppressed, crushed human nature, lying and bleeding fragments".<ref>{{cite episode |title=Victoria and Her Sisters |series= A History of Britain |serieslink= A History of Britain (TV series) |credits= [[Simon Schama]] (presenter) |network= [[BBC One]] |airdate= 4 June 2002 |number=13}}</ref>

The number of [[cotton mill]]s in Manchester itself reached a peak of 108 in 1853.<ref name="GMArch"/> Thereafter the number began to decline and Manchester was surpassed as the largest centre of cotton spinning by [[Bolton]] in the 1850s and [[Oldham]] in the 1860s.<ref name="GMArch"/> However, this period of decline coincided with the rise of the city as the financial centre of the region.<ref name="GMArch"/> Manchester continued to process cotton, and in 1913, 65% of the world's cotton was processed in the area.<ref name="Kidd"/> The First World War interrupted access to the export markets. Cotton processing in other parts of the world increased, often on machines produced in Manchester. Manchester suffered greatly from the [[Great Depression in the United Kingdom|Great Depression]] and the underlying structural changes that began to supplant the old industries, including textile manufacture.

=== Blitz ===
Like most of the UK, the Manchester area was mobilised extensively during the [[World War II|Second World War]]. For example, casting and machining expertise at [[Beyer, Peacock and Company]]'s locomotive works in [[Gorton]] was switched to bomb making; [[Dunlop Rubber|Dunlop]]'s rubber works in [[Chorlton-on-Medlock]] made [[barrage balloon]]s; and just outside the city in [[Trafford Park]], engineers [[Metropolitan-Vickers]] made [[Avro Manchester]] and [[Avro Lancaster]] bombers and [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]] built the [[Rolls-Royce Merlin]] engines to power them. Manchester was thus the target of bombing by the [[Luftwaffe]], and by late 1940 air raids were taking place against non-military targets. The biggest took place during the "[[Manchester Blitz|Christmas Blitz]]" on the nights of 22/23 and 24 December 1940, when an estimated {{convert|467|long ton|t|order=flip}} of high explosives plus over 37,000 incendiary bombs were dropped. A large part of the historic city centre was destroyed, including 165 warehouses, 200 business premises, and 150 offices. 376 were killed and 30,000 houses were damaged.<ref>{{cite book | last= Hardy | first= Clive | title= Manchester at War | edition= 2nd | year= 2005 | location= Altrincham| isbn= 1-84547-096-6 | pages=75–99 | chapter= The blitz | publisher=First Edition Limited }}</ref> [[Manchester Cathedral]] was among the buildings seriously damaged; its restoration took 20 years.<ref name="WWII">{{cite web | url= http://www.manchestercathedral.org/history/timeline | title= Timeline | accessdate=5 May 2009 | publisher=Manchester Cathedral Online | year= 2008}}</ref>

Manchester has a history of attacks attributed to Irish Republicans, including the [[Manchester Martyrs]] of 1867, arson in 1920, a series of explosions in 1939, and two bombs in 1992.
On Saturday 15 June 1996, the [[Provisional Irish Republican Army]] (IRA) carried out the [[1996 Manchester bombing]], the detonation of a large bomb next to a department store in the city centre. The largest to be detonated on British soil, the bomb injured over 200 people, heavily damaged nearby buildings, and broke windows {{convert|1/2|mi|m}} away.

The City of Manchester is governed by the [[Manchester City Council]]. The [[Greater Manchester Combined Authority]], with a [[Mayor of Greater Manchester|directly elected mayor]], has responsibilities for economic strategy and transport, amongst other areas, on a Greater Manchester-wide basis. Manchester has been a member of the English [[Core Cities Group]] since its inception in 1995.<ref name="Core city">{{cite web|url=http://www.corecities.com/dev07/Introduction/about.html |title=About the Core Cities Group|accessdate=9 July 2007|publisher=English [[Core Cities Group]]|year=2004 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070919035621/http://www.corecities.com/dev07/Introduction/about.html |archivedate=19 September 2007}}</ref>

The town of Manchester was granted a charter by Thomas Grelley in 1301, but lost its [[borough status in the United Kingdom|borough status]] in a court case of 1359. Until the 19th century local government was largely in the hands of [[manorial court]]s, the last of which was dissolved in 1846.<ref name="GM Gazetteer">{{cite web|url=http://www.gmcro.co.uk/Guides/Gazeteer/gazzm2n.htm|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110211203737/http://www.gmcro.co.uk/Guides/Gazeteer/gazzm2n.htm|archivedate=11 February 2011|title=Greater Manchester Gazetteer|publisher=Greater Manchester County Record Office|accessdate=9 July 2007|at=Places names – M to N}}</ref>

Manchester later formed its own [[Poor Law Union]] using the name "Manchester".<ref name="GM Gazetteer"/> In 1792, Commissioners—usually known as "Police Commissioners"—were established for the social improvement of Manchester.

In 1853, Manchester was granted [[city status in the United Kingdom|"city status" in the United Kingdom]].<ref name="GM Gazetteer"/>

In 1885, [[Bradford, Greater Manchester|Bradford]], [[Harpurhey]], [[Rusholme]] and parts of [[Moss Side]] and [[Withington]] townships became part of the City of Manchester. In 1889, the city became a [[county borough]] as did many larger Lancashire towns, and therefore not governed by [[Lancashire County Council]].<ref name="GM Gazetteer"/> Between 1890 and 1933, more areas were added to the city which had been administered by Lancashire County Council, including former villages such as [[Burnage]], [[Chorlton-cum-Hardy]], [[Didsbury]], [[Fallowfield]], [[Levenshulme]], [[Longsight]], and [[Withington]]. In 1931, the [[Cheshire]] [[civil parishes in England|civil parishes]] of [[Baguley]], [[Northenden]] and [[Northen Etchells]] from the south of the [[River Mersey]] were added.<ref name="GM Gazetteer"/> In 1974, by way of the [[Local Government Act 1972]], the City of Manchester became a [[metropolitan district]] of the [[metropolitan county]] of [[Greater Manchester]].<ref name="GM Gazetteer"/> That year, [[Ringway, Greater Manchester|Ringway]], the village where the [[Manchester Airport]] is located, was added to the City.

In November 2014, it was announced that Greater Manchester would receive a [[Mayor of Greater Manchester|new directly elected Mayor]].

At {{Coord|53|28|0|N|2|14|0|W|type:city}}, {{convert|160|mi|km|sigfig=2}} northwest of London, Manchester lies in a bowl-shaped land area bordered to the north and east by the [[Pennines]], an upland chain that runs the length of [[northern England]], and to the south by the [[Cheshire Plain]]. Manchester is {{convert|35.0|mi}} north-east of [[Liverpool]] and {{convert|35.0|mi}} north-west of [[Sheffield]], making the city the halfway point between the two. The [[Manchester city centre|city centre]] is on the east bank of the [[River Irwell]], near its confluences with the Rivers [[River Medlock|Medlock]] and [[River Irk|Irk]], and is relatively low-lying, being between {{convert|115|to|138|ft|m|abbr=off|order=flip}} above sea level.<ref name="Topography">{{cite book|title=Manchester: A History|last=Kidd|first=Alan|year=2006|page=11|publisher=Carnegie Publishing|location=Lancaster|isbn=1-85936-128-5}}</ref> The [[River Mersey]] flows through the south of Manchester. Much of the inner city, especially in the south, is flat, offering extensive views from many highrise buildings in the city of the foothills and moors of the Pennines, which can often be capped with snow in the winter months. Manchester's geographic features were highly influential in its early development as the world's first industrial city. These features are its climate, its proximity to a [[port|seaport]] at [[Liverpool]], the availability of water power from its rivers, and its nearby coal reserves.<ref name="Coalfields">{{cite web |url=http://www.mosi.org.uk/media/159631/the%20manchester%20coalfields.pdf |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090327122645/http://www.mosi.org.uk/media/159631/the%20manchester%20coalfields.pdf |archivedate=27 March 2009 |title=The Manchester Coalfields  |accessdate=5 May 2009|publisher=[[Museum of Science and Industry in Manchester]] |year=2001 |format=PDF}}</ref>
[[File:Map of Manchester.png|thumb|left|upright|The City of Manchester. The [[land use]] is overwhelmingly urban]]
The name Manchester, though officially applied only to the metropolitan district within Greater Manchester, has been applied to other, wider divisions of land, particularly across much of the Greater Manchester county and urban area. The "Manchester City Zone", "[[M postcode area|Manchester post town]]" and the "[[Manchester Congestion Charge]]" are all examples of this.

For purposes of the [[Office for National Statistics]], Manchester forms the most populous settlement within the [[Greater Manchester Urban Area]], the United Kingdom's third-largest conurbation. There is a mixture of high-density urban and suburban locations in Manchester. The largest open space in the city, at around {{convert|260|ha|acre|0}},<ref>{{cite web |url=http://m2002.thecgf.com/venues/HPK/ |title= Heaton Park |accessdate=20 July 2009 |publisher=thecgf.com}}</ref> is [[Heaton Park]]. Manchester is contiguous on all sides with several large settlements, except for a small section along its southern boundary with [[Cheshire]]. The [[M60 motorway|M60]] and [[M56 motorway]]s pass through the south of Manchester, through [[Northenden]] and [[Wythenshawe]] respectively. Heavy rail lines enter the city from all directions, the principal destination being [[Manchester Piccadilly station]].

=== Climate ===
Manchester experiences a [[temperate]] [[Oceanic climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]]: ''Cfb''), like much of the British Isles, with mild summers and cool winters. Summer daytime temperatures regularly top 20 Celsius, typically reaching 25 Celsius on sunny days throughout July and August in particular. In more recent years, temperatures now reach over 30 Celsius on occasions. There is regular but generally light precipitation throughout the year.

===Green belt===
{{further|North West Green Belt}}
Manchester lies at the centre of a [[Green belt (United Kingdom)|green belt]] region that extends into the wider surrounding counties, which is in place to reduce urban sprawl, prevent the towns in the conurbation from further convergence, protect the identity of outlying communities, and preserve nearby countryside. This is achieved by restricting inappropriate development within the designated areas, and imposing stricter conditions on permitted building.<ref name="belt2"/>

Due to being already highly urban, the city contains limited portions of protected green belt area within [[Greenfield land|greenfield]] throughout the borough, with minimal development opportunities,<ref>{{cite web|title=Urban Density -v- Suburban Sprawl – The Leader's Blog|url=http://www.manchester.gov.uk/blog/leadersblog/post/840/urban-density-v-suburban-sprawl|website=www.manchester.gov.uk|language=en}}</ref> at [[Clayton Vale]], [[Heaton Park]], Chorlton Water Park along with the [[Chorlton Ees|Chorlton Ees & Ivy Green]] nature reserve and the floodplain surrounding the River Mersey, as well as the southern area around Manchester Airport.<ref>{{cite web|title=Manchester's Local Development Framework Core Strategy Development Plan Document Adopted 11th July 2012 Published by Manchester City Council|url=http://www.manchester.gov.uk/download/downloads/id/18981/final_core_strategy.pdf|website=www.manchester.gov.uk}}</ref>
