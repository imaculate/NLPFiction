'''Lichfield''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|l|ɪ|tʃ|f|iː|l|d}}) is a [[city status in the United Kingdom|cathedral city]] and [[Civil parishes in England|civil parish]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ons.gov.uk/about-statistics/geography/products/geog-products-area/names-codes/administrative/index.html |title=Names and codes for Administrative Geography |date=31 December 2008 |publisher=Office for National Statistics |accessdate=15 September 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20100403045115/http://www.ons.gov.uk/about-statistics/geography/products/geog-products-area/names-codes/administrative/index.html |archivedate=3 April 2010 }}</ref> in [[Staffordshire]], [[England]]. One of eight civil parishes with city status in England, Lichfield is situated roughly {{convert|16|mi|km|abbr=on}} north of [[Birmingham]], {{convert|9|mi|km|0}} from [[Walsall]] and {{convert|13|mi|km|0}} from [[Burton Upon Trent]]. At the time of the 2011 Census the population was estimated at 32,219 and the wider [[Lichfield District]] at 100,700.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/interactive/vp2-2011-census-comparator/index.html|title = Office for National Statistics - Census 2011|date = 20 July 2012}}</ref>

Notable for its three-spired medieval [[Lichfield Cathedral|cathedral]], Lichfield was the birthplace of [[Samuel Johnson]], the writer of the first authoritative ''[[A Dictionary of the English Language|Dictionary of the English Language]]''. The city's [[recorded history]] began when [[Chad of Mercia]] arrived to establish his [[Diocese of Lichfield|Bishopric]] in 669&nbsp;AD and the settlement grew as the ecclesiastical centre of [[Mercia]]. In 2009, the [[Staffordshire Hoard]], the largest hoard of [[Anglo-Saxons|Anglo-Saxon]] gold and silver metalwork, was found {{convert|5.9|km|mi|abbr=on}} south-west of Lichfield.

The development of the city was consolidated in the 12th century under [[Roger de Clinton]], who fortified the [[Cathedral Close, Lichfield|Cathedral Close]] and also laid out the town with the ladder-shaped street pattern that survives to this day. Lichfield's heyday was in the 18th century, when it developed into a thriving coaching city. This was a period of great intellectual activity, the city being the home of many famous people including Samuel Johnson, [[David Garrick]], [[Erasmus Darwin]] and [[Anna Seward]], and prompted Johnson's remark that Lichfield was "a city of philosophers".

Today, the city still retains its old importance as an ecclesiastical centre, and its industrial and commercial development has been limited. The centre of the city has over 230 [[Listed buildings in Lichfield|listed buildings]] (including many examples of [[Georgian architecture]]), and preserves much of its historic character.

== Etymology ==
The origin of the modern name "Lichfield" is twofold. At [[Wall, Staffordshire|Wall]], {{convert|3.5|km|mi|abbr=on}} south of the current city, there was a [[Romano-British culture|Romano-British]] village, [[Letocetum]], a [[Common Brittonic]] place name meaning "Greywood", "grey" perhaps referring to varieties of tree prominent in the landscape such as ash and elm.<ref>{{cite book|title=Lichfield: The place and street names, population and boundaries ', A History of the County of Stafford: Volume 14: Lichfield|year=1990|pages=37–42|url=http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=42340}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://kepn.nottingham.ac.uk/map/place/Staffordshire/Lichfield |title=Lichfield |work=Key to English Place Names |publisher=Institute for Name Studies, [[University of Nottingham]] |accessdate=12 May 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304063744/http://kepn.nottingham.ac.uk/map/place/Staffordshire/Lichfield |archive-date=4 March 2016 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}</ref> This passed into [[Old English]] as ''Lyccid'',<ref name=Delamarre>{{cite book|last=Delamarre|first=Xavier|title=Noms de lieux celtiques de l'europe ancienne (-500/+500): Dictionnaire|year=2012|publisher=Éditions Errance|location=Arles, France|isbn=978-2-87772-483-8|page=175}}</ref> cf. {{lang-owl|Luitcoyt}},<ref name=Sims>{{cite book|title=Britain 400–600: Language and History|year=1990|publisher=Carl Winter Universitätsverlag|location=Heidelberg|isbn=3-533-04271-5|page=260|author=Patrick Sims-Williams|authorlink=Dating the Transition to Neo-Brittonic: Phonology and History, 400-600|editor=Alfred Bammesberger|chapter=2}}</ref>  to which was appended {{lang-ang|feld}} "open country". This word {{lang|ang|Lyccidfeld}} is the origin of the word "Lichfield".<ref name=Delamarre />

Popular etymology has it that a thousand Christians were martyred in Lichfield around AD 300 during the reign of [[Diocletian]] and that the name Lichfield actually means "field of the dead" (see ''[[lich]]''). There is no evidence to support this legend, as with many [[Folk etymology|folk etymologies]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=42340|title=Explaining the origin of the 'field of the dead' legend |publisher= British History Online |accessdate=20 November 2008}}</ref>

== History ==

=== Prehistory and antiquity ===
{{Main|Letocetum}}
The earliest evidence of settlement is [[Mesolithic]] flints discovered on the high ground of the cemetery at [[St Michael on Greenhill, Lichfield|St Michael on Greenhill]], which may indicate an early flint industry. Traces of [[Neolithic]] settlement have been discovered on the south side of the sandstone ridge occupied by [[Lichfield Cathedral]].<ref name=staf>{{Citation | last =Greenslade | first =M.W. | authorlink = | title =A History of the County of Stafford: Volume XIV: Lichfield|edition= | publisher = Victoria County History| year =1990 | location = | page = | isbn =978-0-19-722778-7  }}</ref>

{{convert|2.2|mi|km|abbr=on}} south-west of Lichfield, near the point where [[Icknield Street]] crosses [[Watling Street]], was the site of Letocetum (the [[Common Brittonic|Brittonic]] *Lētocaiton, "Greywood"). Established in AD 50 as a [[Roman Empire|Roman]] military fortress, it had become a civilian settlement ([[vicus]]) with a bath house and a [[mansio]] by the 2nd century.<ref name=staf/> Letocetum fell into decline by the 4th century and the Romans had left by the 5th century. There have been scattered Romano-British finds in Lichfield and it is possible that a burial discovered beneath the cathedral in 1751 was Romano-British.<ref name=staf/> There is no evidence of what happened to Letocetum after the Romans left; however, Lichfield may have emerged as the inhabitants of Letocetum relocated during its decline. A {{nowrap|Cair Luit Coyd}} ("[[Caer|Fort]] Greywood") was listed by [[Nennius]] among the 28 cities of [[Sub-Roman Britain|Britain]] in his ''[[Historia Brittonum]]'',<ref>[[Nennius]] ({{abbr|attrib.|Traditional attribution}}). [[Theodor Mommsen]] ({{abbr|ed.|Editor}}). [[s:la:Historia Brittonum#VI. CIVITATES BRITANNIAE|''Historia Brittonum'', VI.]] Composed after {{sc|ad}}&nbsp;830. {{la icon}} Hosted at [[s:la:Main Page|Latin Wikisource]].</ref> although these were largely historic remembrances of early [[Sub-Roman Britain]].

=== Middle Ages ===
[[File:LichCathedral4.jpg|thumbnail|200px|left|The three-spired [[Lichfield Cathedral]] was built between 1195 and 1249.]]
The early history of Lichfield is obscure. The first authentic record of Lichfield occurs in [[Bede]]'s history, where it is called ''Licidfelth'' and mentioned as the place where [[Chad of Mercia|St Chad]] fixed the [[episcopal see]] of the Mercians in 669. The first [[Christians|Christian]] king of [[Mercia]], [[Wulfhere of Mercia|Wulfhere]], donated land at Lichfield for St Chad to build a monastery. It was because of this that the ecclesiastical centre of Mercia became settled as the [[Diocese of Lichfield]], which was approximately {{convert|7|mi|km|0}} northwest of the seat of the Mercian kings at [[Tamworth, Staffordshire|Tamworth]].

In July 2009, the [[Staffordshire Hoard]], the largest collection of [[Anglo-Saxon]] gold ever found,  was discovered in a field in the parish of [[Hammerwich]], {{convert|4|mi|km|1|abbr=on}} south-west of Lichfield; it was probably deposited in the 7th century.

The first cathedral was built on the present site in 700 when Bishop [[Hædde]] built a new church to house the bones of St Chad, which had become the centre of a sacred shrine to many pilgrims when he died in 672. The burial in the cathedral of the kings of Mercia, Wulfhere in 674 and [[Ceolred of Mercia|Ceolred]] in 716, further increased the city's prestige.<ref name="british-history.ac.uk">From: 'Lichfield: History to c.1500', A History of the County of Stafford: Volume 14: Lichfield (1990), pp. 4–14. URL: http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=42336 Date accessed: 24 July 2009.</ref>  In 786 King [[Offa of Mercia|Offa]] made the city an archbishopric with authority over all the bishops from the [[Humber]] to the [[River Thames]]; his appointee was Archbishop [[Hygeberht]]. After King Offa's death in 796, Lichfield's power waned; in 803 the primacy was restored to Canterbury by [[Pope Leo III]] after only 16 years.

The ''[[Historia Brittonum]]'' lists the city as one of the 28 cities of Britain around AD 833.

During the 9th century, Mercia was devastated by Danish [[Vikings]]. Lichfield itself was unwalled and the cathedral was despoiled, so [[Peter of Lichfield|Bishop Peter]] moved the see to the fortified and wealthier [[Chester]] in 1075. At the time of the [[Domesday Book]] survey (1086), Lichfield was held by the [[bishop of Chester]]; Lichfield was listed as a small village. The lord of the manor was the Bishop of Chester until the reign of [[Edward VI of England|Edward VI]].[[File:Staffordshire hoard annotated.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Staffordshire Hoard]] was discovered in a field near Lichfield]] In 1102 Bishop Peter's successor, [[Robert de Limesey]], transferred the see from Chester to Coventry. The Bishop of Coventry and Lichfield had seats in both locations; work on the present Gothic cathedral at Lichfield began in 1195. (In 1837 the see of Lichfield acquired independent status, and the style 'Bishop of Lichfield' was adopted.)

Bishop [[Roger de Clinton]] was responsible for transforming the scattered settlements to the south of Minster Pool into the ladder-plan streets existing today. Market Street, Wade Street, Bore Street and Frog Lane linked Dam Street, Conduit Street and Bakers Lane on one side with Bird Street and St John Street on the other. Bishop de Clinton also fortified the cathedral close and enclosed the town with a bank and ditch, and gates were set up where roads into the town crossed the ditch.<ref name="british-history.ac.uk"/> In 1291 Lichfield was severely damaged by a fire which destroyed most of the town; however the Cathedral and Close survived unscathed.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.localhistories.org/lichfield.html|title=Brief History of Lichfield |publisher= Local Histories|accessdate=20 November 2008}}</ref>

In 1387 [[Richard II of England|Richard II]] gave a charter for the foundation of the guild of St Mary and St John the Baptist; this guild functioned as the local government, until its dissolution by [[Edward VI of England|Edward VI]], who incorporated the town in 1548.

=== Early Modern ===
[[File:John Snape Lichfield Plan.jpg|thumb|left|Map of Lichfield in 1781]]
The policies of [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]] had a dramatic effect on Lichfield. The [[English Reformation|Reformation]] brought the disappearance of pilgrim traffic following the destruction of St Chad's shrine in 1538, which was a major loss to the city's economic prosperity. That year too the [[The Franciscan Friary, Lichfield|Franciscan Friary]] was dissolved, the site becoming a private estate. Further economic decline followed the outbreak of [[Black Death|plague]] in 1593, which resulted in the death of over a third of the entire population.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=42337|title='Lichfield: From the Reformation to c.1800', A History of the County of Stafford: Volume 14: Lichfield (1990), pp. 14-24. |publisher= British History Online |accessdate=22 November 2008}}</ref>

Three people were burned at the stake for [[heresy]] under Mary I. The last public burning at the stake in England took place in Lichfield, when [[Edward Wightman]] from [[Burton upon Trent]] was [[Execution by burning|executed by burning]] in the Market Place on 11 April 1612 for promoting himself as the divine [[Paraclete]] and Saviour of the world.<ref>[[s:Page:Dictionary of National Biography volume 61.djvu/201|Wikisource: ''Dictionary of National Biography'']]</ref><ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=9AxAAAAAYAAJ&pg=PT379&lpg=PT379&dq=%22Edward+Wightman%22+treason&source=bl&ots=4iNNPt1Fb1&sig=rhZEDpVPZoGMvaYAwawtyuf5nFg&hl=en&ei=K5txTIvhMcKB8gaQzsCtDQ&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1&ved=0CBYQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=%22Edward%20Wightman%22%20treason&f=false Cobbett's complete collection of state trials and proceedings], 735–736.</ref>

In the [[English Civil War]], Lichfield was divided. The cathedral authorities, supported by some of the townsfolk, were for the king, but the townsfolk generally sided with the Parliament. This led to the fortification of the close in 1643. Lichfield's position as a focus of supply routes had an important strategic significance during the war, and both forces were anxious for control of the city. The Parliamentary commander [[Robert Greville, 2nd Baron Brooke|Lord Brooke]] led an assault on the fortified close, but was killed by a deflected bullet on St Chad's day in 1643, an accident welcomed as a miracle by the Royalists. The close subsequently yielded to the Parliamentarians, but was retaken by [[Prince Rupert of the Rhine]] in the same year; on the collapse of the Royalist cause in 1646 it again surrendered. The cathedral suffered extensive damage from the war, including the complete destruction of the central spire. It was restored at the Restoration under the supervision of [[John Hacket|Bishop Hacket]], and thanks in part to the generosity of [[King Charles II of England|King Charles II]].

Lichfield started to develop a lively coaching trade as a stop-off on the busy route between London and [[Chester]] from the 1650s onwards, making it Staffordshire's most prosperous town. In the 18th century, and then reaching its peak in the period from 1800—1840, the city thrived as a busy coaching city on the main routes from London to the north-west and Birmingham to the north-east. It also became a centre of great intellectual activity, being the home of many famous people including [[Samuel Johnson]], [[David Garrick]], [[Erasmus Darwin]] and [[Anna Seward]]; this prompted Johnson's remark that Lichfield was "a city of philosophers". In the 1720s [[Daniel Defoe]] described Lichfield as 'a fine, neat, well-built, and indifferent large city', the principal town in the region after Chester.<ref name="From 1990 pp. 14-24">From: 'Lichfield: From the Reformation to c.1800', A History of the County of Stafford: Volume 14: Lichfield (1990), pp. 14-24. URL: http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=42337 Date accessed: 24 July 2009.</ref>  During the late 18th and early 19th century much of the medieval city was rebuilt with the red-brick [[Georgian architecture|Georgian style]] buildings still to be seen today. Also during this time, the city's infrastructure underwent great improvements, with underground sewerage systems, paved streets and gas-powered street lighting.<ref name=clay>{{Citation | last =Clayton | first =Howard | authorlink = | title =Coaching City|edition= | publisher = Abbotsford Publishing| year =1981 | location = | page = | isbn =978-0-9503563-1-0}}</ref> An infantry regiment of the [[British Army]] was formed at Lichfield in 1705 by Col. [[Luke Lillingstone]] in the King's Head tavern in Bird Street. In 1751 it became the 38th Regiment of Foot, and in 1783 the 1st [[Staffordshire Regiment]]; after reorganisation in 1881 it became the 1st battalion of the [[South Staffordshire Regiment]].<ref name="From 1990 pp. 14-24"/>

=== Late Modern and contemporary ===

The arrival of the [[Industrial Revolution]] and the railways in 1837 signalled the end of Lichfield's position as an important staging post for coaching traffic. While nearby Birmingham (and its population) expanded greatly during the Industrial Revolution, Lichfield remained largely unchanged in character.

The first council houses were built in the Dimbles area of the city in the 1930s. The outbreak of [[World War II]] brought over 2,000 [[Evacuations of civilians in Britain during World War II|evacuees]] from industrialised areas. However, due to the lack of heavy industry in the city, Lichfield escaped lightly, although there were [[strategic bombing|air raids]] in 1940 and 1941 and three Lichfeldians were killed. Just outside the city, [[Wellington Bomber]]s flew out of Fradley Aerodrome, which was known as [[RAF Lichfield]]. After the war the council built many new houses in the 1960s, including some high-rise flats, while the late 1970s and early 1980s saw the construction of a large housing estate at Boley Park in the south-east of the city. The city's population tripled between 1951 and the late 1980s.

The city has continued expanding to the west. The Darwin Park housing estate has been under development for a number of years and has swelled the city's population by approximately 3,000. Plans have been approved for Friarsgate, a new £100 million shopping and leisure complex opposite [[Lichfield City Station]]. The police station, bus station, Ford garage and multi-storey car park will be demolished to make way for 22,000 m<sup>2</sup> of retail space and 2,000 m<sup>2</sup> of leisure facilities, consisting of a flagship department store, six-screen cinema, hotel, 37 individual shops and 56 flats.<ref name=ldcfp>{{Citation| url = http://www.lichfielddc.gov.uk/site/scripts/documents_info.php?documentID=1328| title = Lichfield District Council:Friarsgate Plans| accessdate = 26 January 2011| publisher = | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20110928030819/http://www.lichfielddc.gov.uk/site/scripts/documents_info.php?documentID=1328| archive-date = 28 September 2011| dead-url = yes| df = dmy-all}}</ref>

== Governance ==

=== Local government ===
Historically the [[Bishop of Lichfield]] had authority over the city. It was not until 1548, with Edward VI's charter, that Lichfield had any form of secular government. As a reward for the support given to Mary I by the bailiffs and citizens during the Duke of Northumberland's attempt to prevent her accession, the Queen issued a new charter in 1553, confirming the 1548 charter and in addition granting the city its own Sheriff. The same charter made Lichfield a county separate from the rest of [[Staffordshire]]. It remained so until 1888.

The City Council (not to be confused with [[Lichfield District Council]], which has authority over a wider area than Lichfield city) has 28 members (from the 7 wards of Boley Park, Chadsmead, Curborough, Leamonsley, St John's, Pentire Road and Stowe), who are elected every four years. After the 2015 parish council elections, the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservatives]] remained in overall control, with the 28 seats being divided between the Conservatives (26), [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] (1) and [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|the Liberal Democrats]] (1). The [[Worship (style)|Right Worshipful]] the [[Mayor]] of Lichfield (currently [[Councillor]] David Leytham <ref>http://www.lichfieldmercury.co.uk/new-mayor-and-sheriff-of-lichfield-sworn-in/story-30334895-detail/story.html{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>) is the civic head of the Council<ref name="lichfield.gov.uk">{{cite web |url=http://www.lichfield.gov.uk/cc-structure.ihtml |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-06-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120715073152/http://www.lichfield.gov.uk/cc-structure.ihtml |archivedate=15 July 2012 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> and chairs Council meetings. The Council also appoints a Leader of Council to be the main person responsible for leadership of the Council's political and policy matters. The Council's current Leader is [[Councillor]] Bernard Cocksey. Lichfield is one of only 15 towns and cities in England and Wales which appoints a [[High Sheriff|Sheriff]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.lichfield.gov.uk/cc.ihtml |title=Lichfield City Council Functions |publisher=Lichfield.gov.uk |date= |accessdate=17 July 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100423113052/http://www.lichfield.gov.uk/cc.ihtml |archivedate=23 April 2010 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>

=== Members of Parliament ===

The [[Lichfield (UK Parliament constituency)|Lichfield constituency]] sent two members to the parliament of 1304 and to a few succeeding parliaments, but the representation did not become regular until 1552; in 1867 it lost one member, and in 1885 its representation was merged into that of the county.<ref name="From 1990 pp. 14-24"/> The Lichfield constituency was abolished in 1950 and replaced with the [[Lichfield and Tamworth (UK Parliament constituency)|Lichfield and Tamworth constituency]]. This constituency lasted until 1983, when it was replaced with the [[Mid Staffordshire (UK Parliament constituency)|Mid Staffordshire constituency]].

Based on the resident's location in Lichfield, there are technically two MPs. The current Member of Parliament for Lichfield centre is the Conservative [[Michael Fabricant]], who has been MP for Lichfield since 1997. Fabricant was first elected for the [[Mid Staffordshire (UK Parliament constituency)|Mid Staffordshire constituency]] in [[United Kingdom general election, 1992|1992]], regaining the seat for the Conservatives following [[Sylvia Heal]]'s victory for [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] at the [[Mid Staffordshire by-election, 1990|1990 by-election]]. Fabricant took the seat with a majority of 6,236 and has remained a Member of Parliament since. The Mid Staffordshire seat was abolished at the [[United Kingdom general election, 1997|1997 general election]], but Fabricant contested and won the Lichfield constituency, which partially replaced it, by just 238 votes. He has remained the Lichfield MP since, increasing his majority to 4,426 in [[United Kingdom general election, 2001|2001]], 7,080 in [[United Kingdom general election, 2005|2005]], 17,683 in [[United Kingdom general election, 2010|2010]] and 18,189 in 2015.

Christopher Pincher is current Member of Parliament for Tamworth and areas of Lichfield (see https://web.archive.org/web/20180824194404/http://christopherpincher.com/in-your-area/map) and was elected as the Conservative Member in May 2010, and was re-elected in May 2015 with a majority of 11,302.

==Geography==

Lichfield covers an area of approximately {{convert|5.41|sqmi|km2|abbr=on}} in the south-east of the county of Staffordshire in the West Midlands region of England. It is approximately {{convert|25|km|mi|abbr=on}} north of Birmingham and {{convert|200|km|mi|abbr=on}} north-west of London. The city is located between the high ground of [[Cannock Chase]] to the west and the valleys of the Rivers [[River Trent|Trent]] and [[River Tame, West Midlands|Tame]] to the east. It is underlain by red [[sandstone]], deposited during the arid desert conditions of the [[Triassic]] period. [[Keuper marl|Mercia Mudstone]] underlies the north and north-eastern edges of the city towards [[Curborough and Elmhurst|Elmhurst and Curborough]]. The red sandstone underlying the majority of Lichfield is present in many of its ancient buildings, including Lichfield Cathedral and the [[The Church of St Chad, Lichfield|Church of St Chad]].<ref name=bgs>{{Citation|url=http://maps.bgs.ac.uk/geologyviewer_google/googleviewer.html |title=British Geological Survey:Geology of Britain viewer |accessdate=20 January 2011 |publisher= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110727004018/http://maps.bgs.ac.uk/geologyviewer_google/googleviewer.html |archivedate=27 July 2011 |df= }}</ref>

The ground within the city slopes down from 116m in the north-west to 86m on the sandstone shelf where Lichfield Cathedral stands. To the south and east of the city centre is a ridge which reaches 103 m at [[St Michael on Greenhill, Lichfield|St Michael on Greenhill]]. Boley Park lies on top of a ridge with its highest point on Borrowcop Hill at 113m. To the south-east the level drops to 69 m where Tamworth Road crosses the city boundary into Freeford.

The city is built on the two sides of a shallow valley, into which flow two streams from the west, the Trunkfield Brook and the Leamonsley Brook, and out of which the Curborough Brook runs to the north-east, eventually flowing into the [[River Trent]]. The two streams have been dammed south of the cathedral on Dam Street to form [[Minster Pool]] and near St Chad's Road to form [[Stowe Pool]].

== Economy ==
[[File:tudorcafe.jpg|thumb|The Tudor Café in Bore Street was built in 1510]]
Lichfield's wealth grew along with its importance as an ecclesiastical centre. The original settlement prospered as the place where pilgrims gathered to worship at the shrine of St Chad: this practice continued until the [[English Reformation|Reformation]], when the shrine was destroyed.

In the Middle Ages, the main industry in Lichfield was making woollen cloth; there was also a leather industry. Much of the surrounding area was open pasture, and there were many surrounding farms.

In the 18th century, Lichfield became a busy coaching centre. Inns and hostelries grew up to provide accommodation, and industries dependent on the coaching trade such as coach builders, corn and hay merchants, saddlers and tanneries began to thrive. The main source of wealth to the city came from the money generated by its many visitors. The invention of the railways saw a decline in coach travel, and with it came the decline in Lichfield's prosperity.

By the end of the 19th century, [[brewing]] was the principal industry, and in the neighbourhood were large market gardens which provided food for the growing populations of nearby Birmingham and the [[Black Country]].

Today there are a number of light industrial areas, predominantly in the east of the city, not dominated by any one particular industry. The district is famous for two local manufacturers: [[Armitage Shanks]], makers of baths/bidets and showers, and [[Arthur Price|Arthur Price of England]], master cutlers and silversmiths.  Many residents commute to Birmingham.

Lichfield City Council has predicted that, once completed, the new Friarsgate retail and leisure development could attract 11,000 more visitors to the city every month, generating annual sales of around £61 million and creating hundreds of jobs in the city.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://iclichfield.icnetwork.co.uk/news/localnews//tm_headline=credit-squeeze-delays-friarsgate&method=full&objectid=22250839&siteid=108911-name_page.html|title=Economic benefits of new development to Lichfield |publisher= icLichfield |accessdate=20 November 2008}}</ref>

The city is home to [[Central England Co-operative]] (and its predecessor [[Midlands Co-operative Society]]), the second largest independent consumer co-operative in the UK.

Lichfield is served by two railway stations, [[Lichfield City railway station|Lichfield City]] and [[Lichfield Trent Valley railway station|Lichfield Trent Valley]], both built by the [[London and North Western Railway]]. These stations are now on the [[Cross-City Line]] to [[Redditch railway station|Redditch]] via [[Birmingham New Street railway station|Birmingham]]. Additionally, Trent Valley station is on the [[West Coast Main Line]] with semi-fast services between [[Euston railway station|London Euston]] - [[Stoke-on-Trent railway station|Stoke]], [[Stafford railway station|Stafford]] and [[Crewe railway station|Crewe]].

Until 2009, the nearest mosques were either [[Burton-upon-Trent]] or [[Stafford]]. There were plans to open a mosque but to build a traditional one meaning it would be on par with Lichfield Cathedral but is was heavily opposed and the plans were shelved. After that, the Muslim Community Association put a bid on an old school in Stowe Street which they bought from South Staffordshire County Council. It is the only Islamic establishment in Lichfield while other ones are in Burton-Upon-Trent, Stafford, [[Stoke-On-Trent]] or [[Walsall]].
