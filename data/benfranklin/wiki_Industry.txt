'''''Industry''''' is the [[Production (economics)|production]] of [[Good (economics)|goods]] or related [[Service (economics)|services]] within an [[economy]].<ref>[http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/industry Industry | Define Industry at Dictionary.com<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140204025505/http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/industry |date=2014-02-04 }}</ref> The major source of revenue of a group or company is the indicator of its relevant industry.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/industry.asp|title='Definition of Industry' Investopedia|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20132117352400/http://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/industry.asp|archivedate=2017-07-24|df=|date=2003-11-20}}</ref>  When a large group has multiple sources of revenue generation, it is considered to be working in different industries. Manufacturing industry became a key sector of production and labour in [[Europe]]an and [[North America]]n countries during the [[Industrial Revolution]], upsetting previous [[Mercantilism|mercantile]] and [[Feudalism|feudal]] economies. This came through many successive rapid advances in technology, such as the production of [[steel]] and [[coal]].

Following the Industrial Revolution, possibly a third of the economic output comes from [[manufacturing]] industries. Many [[Developed country|developed countries]] and many developing/semi-developed countries (China, India etc.) depend significantly on manufacturing industry.

==History==

===Slavery===

{{main|Slavery}}
Slavery, the practice of utilizing forced labor to produce goods<ref>{{Cite web|url= http://www.newint.org/issue337/facts.htm|title= Slavery in the 21st Century|last= |first= |date= |website= newint.org|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20100527095857/http://www.newint.org/issue337/facts.htm|archive-date= 8 May 2002|dead-url= yes|access-date= 2018-07-15}}</ref>{{failed verification|date=July 2018}} and services, has occurred since antiquity throughout the world as a means of low-cost production. It typically produces goods for which profit depends on [[economies of scale]], especially those for which labor was simple and easy to supervise.<ref>Compare: {{Cite journal|last= Lagerlöf|first= Nils-Petter|date= 2006-08-30|title= Slavery and other property rights|url= https://mpra.ub.uni-muenchen.de/372/1/MPRA_paper_372.pdf|language= en | quote = Some argue that slavery died out due to the rise of industrial production modes, involving a larger number of work tasks, thus making slavery more costly in terms of supervision.}}</ref>  [[Slavery in international law|International law]] has declared slavery illegal.<ref>United Nations.

=== Guilds ===

{{main|Guild}}
Guilds, associations of [[artisan]]<nowiki/>s and [[merchant]]s, oversee the production and distribution of a particular good. Guilds have their roots in the [[Roman Empire]] as ''collegia'' (singular: ''collegium'') Membership in these early guilds was voluntary. The Roman ''collegia'' did not survive the fall of Rome.<ref>{{Cite book|title= Wage Labor and Guilds in Medieval Europe|last= Epstein|first= S.A.|publisher= University of North Carolina Press|year= 1991|isbn= |location=|pages= 10–49}}</ref> In the  [[Early Middle Ages|early middle ages]], guilds once again began to emerge in Europe, reaching a degree of maturity by the beginning of the 14th century.<ref>{{Cite book | author = Centre international de synthèse |title= L'Encyclopedie et les encyclopedistes |publisher= B.

The proved institutional mechanisms for this negotiation were the license, the qualifying examination, the diploma, and formal training in a common curriculum. The typical institutions that administered these devices were, first, the guild-like professional association, and later the professional school, which superseded the association in effectiveness. [...] Obviously, none of this was in itself an organizational invention. The guilds of merchants that sprang up in eleventh-century Europe were also voluntary associations tending towards the monopolistic control of a ''new'' form of trade.[...]

===Industrial Revolution===

{{main|Industrial Revolution}}
The industrial revolution (from the mid-18th century to the mid-19th century) saw the development and popularization of mechanized means of production as a replacement for hand production.<ref>Compare: {{Cite web|url= https://www.history.com/topics/industrial-revolution|title= Industrial Revolution - Facts & Summary - HISTORY.com|website= HISTORY.com|access-date= 2018-07-04 | quote = Before the advent of the Industrial Revolution, [...] [m]ost manufacturing was done in homes or small, rural shops, using hand tools or simple machines.}}</ref> The industrial revolution played a role in the [[abolition of slavery]] in Europe and in North America.<ref>

=== Since the Industrial Revolution ===
{{sectstub|date=July 2018}}

== Industrial development ==

[[File:Regenerative-thermal-oxidizer-logistics.jpg|thumb|Optimized [[logistics]] have enabled the rapid development of industry. Here is a [[regenerative thermal oxidiser|thermal oxidizer]] during the industrial shipping process.]]
[[File:Kunda tsemenditehas.jpg|thumb|A factory, a traditional symbol of the industrial development (a [[cement]] factory in [[Kunda, Estonia]])]]
The [[Industrial Revolution]] led to the development of factories for large-scale production with consequent changes in society.<ref name=More2000>{{Cite journal |last=More |first=Charles |title=Understanding the Industrial Revolution |publisher=Routledge |location=London |year=2000 |url=https://www.questia.com/PM.qst?a=o&d=102816164 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110814041034/http://www.questia.com/PM.qst?a=o&d=102816164 |archivedate=2011-08-14 |df= }}</ref> Originally the factories were steam-powered, but later transitioned to [[electricity]] once an [[electrical grid]] was developed. The mechanized [[assembly line]] was introduced to assemble parts in a repeatable fashion, with individual workers performing specific steps during the process. This led to significant increases in efficiency, lowering the cost of the end process. Later [[automation]] was increasingly used to replace human operators. This process has accelerated with the development of the [[computer]] and the [[robot]].

== Deindustrialisation ==
{{main|Deindustrialisation}}
[[File:Clark's Sector Model.png|thumb|upright=2.05|Colin Clark (economist)|[[Colin Clark (economist)|Colin Clark]]'s sector model of an economy undergoing technological change. In later stages, the [[Quaternary sector of the economy]] grows.]]

Historically certain manufacturing industries have gone into a decline due to various economic factors, including the development of replacement technology or the loss of competitive advantage. An example of the former is the decline in [[carriage]] manufacturing when the [[automobile]] was mass-produced.

A recent trend has been the migration of prosperous, industrialized nations towards a [[post-industrial society]]. This is manifested by an increase in the [[service sector]] at the expense of manufacturing, and the development of an information-based economy, the so-called [[informational revolution]]. In a post-industrial society, manufacturers relocate to more profitable locations through a process of [[off-shoring]].

Measurements of manufacturing industries outputs and economic effect are not historically stable. Traditionally, success has been measured in the number of jobs created. The reduced number of employees in the manufacturing sector has been assumed to result from a decline in the competitiveness of the sector, or the introduction of the [[lean manufacturing]] process.

Related to this change is the upgrading of the [[Quality (business)|quality]] of the product being manufactured. While it is possible to produce a low-technology product with low-skill labour, the ability to manufacture high-technology products well is dependent on a highly skilled staff.

== Society ==
{{main|Industrial society}}
An [[industrial society]] is a society driven by the use of [[technology]] to enable [[mass production]], supporting a [[Population growth|large population]] with a high capacity for [[division of labour]]. Today, industry is an important part of most societies and nations. A government must have some kind of [[industrial policy]], regulating industrial placement, [[pollution|industrial pollution]], [[financing]] and [[industrial labour]].

== Industrial labour ==
[[File:Worker 9.JPG|thumb|An industrial [[worker]] amidst heavy steel components (KINEX BEARINGS, [[Bytča]], [[Slovakia]], c. 1995–2000)]]
{{main|Industrial labour}}
{{further|industrial sociology|industrial and organizational psychology|industrial district|industrial park}}
In an industrial society, industry employs a major part of the population. This occurs typically in the manufacturing sector. A labour union is an organization of workers who have banded together to achieve common goals in key areas such as wages, hours, and other working conditions. The trade union, through its leadership, bargains with the employer on behalf of union members ([[wikt:rank and file|rank and file]] members) and negotiates labour contracts with employers. This [[labour movement|movement]] first rose among industrial workers.

== War ==
{{main|Industrial warfare}}
[[File:Airacobra P39 Assembly LOC 02902u.jpg|thumb|The assembly plant of the [[Bell Aircraft Corporation]] ([[Wheatfield, New York]], United States, 1944) producing [[P-39 Airacobra]] fighters]]
The Industrial Revolution changed warfare, with [[mass-produced]] weaponry and supplies, machine-powered transportation, [[mobilization]], the [[total war]] concept and [[weapons of mass destruction]]. Early instances of [[industrial warfare]] were the [[Crimean War]] and the [[American Civil War]], but its full potential showed during the [[world wars]]. See also [[military-industrial complex]], [[arms industries]], [[military industry]] and [[modern warfare]].
