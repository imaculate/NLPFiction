==History==
{{Main|History of Philadelphia|Timeline of Philadelphia}}
Before Europeans arrived, the Philadelphia area was home to the [[Lenape|Lenape (Delaware)]] [[Native Americans in the United States|Indians]] in the village of [[Shackamaxon]]. The Lenape are a Native American tribe and [[First Nations]] [[band government]].<ref name=p422>Pritzker 422</ref> They are also called Delaware Indians,<ref name=josephy>Josephy 188–189</ref> and their historical territory was along the [[Delaware River]] [[drainage basin|watershed]], western [[Long Island]], and the [[Hudson Valley|Lower Hudson Valley]].{{efn|1= Description of the Lenape peoples (Delaware nations) historic territories inside the [[divides]] of the frequently mountainous [[landforms]] flanking the [[Delaware River]]'s [[drainage basin]]. These terrains encompass from South to North and then counter-clockwise:
{{hlist|class=hwrap
| the shores from the east-shore mouth of the river and the sea coast to Western Long Island (all of both colonial [[New Amsterdam]] and [[New Sweden]]), and
| portions of Western Connecticut up to the latitude of the Massachusetts corner of today's boundaries{{mdash }}making the eastern bounds of their influence, thence their region extended:
| westerly past the region around [[Albany, New York]] to the [[Susquehanna River]] side of the [[Catskills]], then
| southerly through the eastern [[Pocono Mountains|Poconos]] outside the rival [[Susquehannock]] lands past [[Province of Pennsylvania|Eastern Pennsylvania]] then southerly past the site of [[History of Philadelphia|Colonial Philadelphia]] past the west bank mouth of the Delaware and extending south from that point along a stretch of sea coast in northern colonial [[Delaware]].
}}
The Susquehanna-Delaware watershed divides bound the frequently contested'' 'hunting grounds''' between the rival [[Susquehannock]] peoples and the Lenape peoples, whilst the Catskills and Berkshires played a similar boundary role in the northern regions of their original colonial era range.}} Most Lenape were pushed out of their Delaware homeland during the 18th century by expanding European colonies, exacerbated by losses from intertribal conflicts.<ref name=josephy/> Lenape communities were weakened by newly introduced diseases, mainly [[smallpox]], and violent conflict with Europeans. [[Iroquois]] people occasionally fought the Lenape. Surviving Lenape moved west into the upper [[Ohio River]] basin. The [[American Revolutionary War]] and United States' independence pushed them further west. In the 1860s, the United States government sent most Lenape remaining in the [[eastern United States]] to the [[Indian Territory]] (present-day Oklahoma and surrounding territory) under the [[Indian removal]] policy. In the 21st century, most Lenape reside in [[Oklahoma]], with some communities living also in [[Wisconsin]], [[Ontario]] (Canada), and in their traditional homelands.

Europeans came to the [[Delaware Valley]] in the early 17th century, with the first settlements founded by the Dutch, who in 1623 built [[Fort Nassau (South River)|Fort Nassau]] on the Delaware River opposite the [[Schuylkill River]] in what is now [[Brooklawn, New Jersey]]. The Dutch considered the entire Delaware River valley to be part of their [[New Netherland]] colony. In 1638, [[Sweden|Swedish]] settlers led by renegade Dutch established the colony of [[New Sweden]] at [[Fort Christina]] (present-day [[Wilmington, Delaware]]) and quickly spread out in the valley. In 1644, New Sweden supported the [[Susquehannock]]s in their military defeat of the English colony of [[Maryland]]. In 1648, the Dutch built [[Fort Beversreede]] on the west bank of the Delaware, south of the Schuylkill near the present-day [[Eastwick, Philadelphia|Eastwick]] neighborhood, to reassert their dominion over the area. The Swedes responded by building [[New Sweden#Forts|Fort Nya Korsholm]], or New [[Korsholm]], named after a town in [[Finland]] with a Swedish majority. In 1655, a Dutch military campaign led by New Netherland Director-General [[Peter Stuyvesant]] took control of the Swedish colony, ending its claim to independence. The Swedish and Finnish settlers continued to have their own militia, religion, and court, and to enjoy substantial autonomy under the Dutch. The English conquered the New Netherland colony in 1664, though the situation did not change substantially until 1682 when the area was included in [[William Penn]]'s charter for Pennsylvania.

In 1681, in partial repayment of a debt, [[Charles II of England]] granted Penn a [[charter]] for what would become the [[Province of Pennsylvania|Pennsylvania colony]]. Despite the royal charter, Penn bought the land from the local Lenape to be on good terms with the Native Americans and ensure peace for his colony.<ref>{{Cite book

Penn named the city Philadelphia, which is [[Greek language|Greek]] for "brotherly love," derived from the [[Ancient Greek]] terms [[wikt:φίλος|φίλος]] ''phílos'' (beloved, dear) and [[wikt:ἀδελφός|ἀδελφός]] ''adelphós'' (brother, brotherly). As a [[Quakers|Quaker]], Penn had experienced religious persecution and wanted his colony to be a place where anyone could worship freely. This tolerance, far more than afforded by most other colonies, led to better relations with the local native tribes and fostered Philadelphia's rapid growth into America's most important city.<ref>{{Cite book

[[File:Benjamin Franklin by Jean-Baptiste Greuze.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Benjamin Franklin]], 1777]]
Penn planned a city on the Delaware River to serve as a port and place for government. Hoping that Philadelphia would become more like an English rural town instead of a city, Penn laid out roads on a [[grid plan]] to keep houses and businesses spread far apart, with areas for gardens and [[orchard]]s. The city's inhabitants did not follow Penn's plans, however, as they crowded by the Delaware River port, and subdivided and resold their lots.<ref>''Philadelphia: A 300-Year History'', pages 7, 14 – 16</ref> Before Penn left Philadelphia for the last time, he issued the Charter of 1701 establishing it as a city. Though poor at first, the city became an important trading center with tolerable living conditions by the 1750s. [[Benjamin Franklin]], a leading citizen, helped improve city services and founded new ones, such as fire protection, a library, and one of the American colonies' first hospitals.

A number of philosophical societies were formed, which were centers of the city's intellectual life: the Philadelphia Society for Promoting Agriculture (1785), the Pennsylvania Society for the Encouragement of Manufactures and the Useful Arts (1787), the [[Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia|Academy of Natural Sciences]] (1812), and the [[Franklin Institute]] (1824).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://explorepahistory.com/story.php?storyId=35&chapter=2 |title=Explore PA History website |publisher=Explorepahistory.com |accessdate=December 23, 2010}}</ref> These societies developed and financed new industries, attracting skilled and knowledgeable immigrants from Europe.

Philadelphia's importance and central location in the colonies made it a natural center for [[American Revolution|America's revolutionaries]]. By the 1750s, Philadelphia had surpassed [[Boston]] to become the largest city and busiest port in [[British America]], and second in the British Empire after [[London]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Lew|first=Alan A.|title=Geography: USA|year=2004|url=http://www.geog.nau.edu/courses/alew/gsp220/text/chapters/ch4.html|publisher=Northern Arizona University|chapter=Chapter 4 – The Mid-Atlantic and Megalopolis|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150202002258/http://www.geog.nau.edu/courses/alew/gsp220/text/chapters/ch4.html|archivedate=February 2, 2015|df=mdy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |title=Robert Morris: Financier of the American Revolution |last=Rappleye |first=Charles |authorlink=Charles Rappleye |year=2010 |publisher=Simon and Schuster |location=New York City |isbn=1-4165-7091-8 |page=13 |url= }}</ref> The city hosted the [[First Continental Congress]] (1774) before the Revolutionary War; the [[Second Continental Congress]] (1775–76),<ref name=WDL1>{{cite web|title=View of Philadelphia, Circa 1770|url=http://www.wdl.org/en/item/9578/|work=[[Library of Congress]]|publisher=[[World Digital Library]]|accessdate=January 4, 2014}}</ref> which signed the [[United States Declaration of Independence]], during the war; and the [[Constitutional Convention (United States)|Constitutional Convention]] (1787) after the war.

The state capital was moved to [[Lancaster, Pennsylvania|Lancaster]] in 1799, then [[Harrisburg, Pennsylvania|Harrisburg]] in 1812, while the federal government was moved to Washington, D.C. in 1800 upon completion of the [[White House]] and [[United States Capitol|U.S. Capitol]] building. The city remained the young nation's largest until the late [[18th century]], being both a financial and a cultural center for America. In 1816, the city's free black community founded the [[African Methodist Episcopal Church]] (AME), the first independent black denomination in the country, and the first black Episcopal Church. The free black community also established many schools for its children, with the help of Quakers. [[New York City]] surpassed Philadelphia in population by 1790. Large-scale construction projects for new roads, [[canal]]s, and [[Rail transport|railroads]] made Philadelphia the first major [[Industrial Revolution|industrial]] city in the United States.

Throughout the [[19th century]], Philadelphia hosted a variety of industries and businesses, the largest being [[textile industry|textiles]]. Major corporations in the 19th and early [[20th century|20th]] centuries included the [[Baldwin Locomotive Works]], [[William Cramp & Sons|William Cramp & Sons Shipbuilding Company]], and the [[Pennsylvania Railroad]].<ref>''Philadelphia: A 300-Year History'', pages 214, 218, 428 – 429</ref> Industry, along with the U.S. Centennial, was celebrated in 1876 with the [[Centennial Exposition]], the first official [[World's fair|World's Fair]] in the United States.

Immigrants, mostly from [[Ireland]] and [[Germany]], settled in Philadelphia and the surrounding districts. These immigrants were largely responsible for the [[1835 Philadelphia general strike|first general strike in North America]] in 1835, in which workers in the city won the ten-hour workday. The city was a destination for thousands of Irish immigrants fleeing the [[Great Famine (Ireland)|Great Famine]] in the 1840s; housing for them was developed south of [[South Street (Philadelphia)|South Street]] and later occupied by succeeding immigrants. They established a network of [[Catholic church|Catholic]] churches and schools and dominated the Catholic clergy for decades. Anti-Irish, anti-Catholic [[Nativism (politics)|nativist]] [[Philadelphia nativist riots|riots]] erupted in Philadelphia in 1844. The rise in population of the surrounding districts helped lead to the [[Act of Consolidation, 1854|Act of Consolidation of 1854]], which extended the city limits from the {{convert|2|sqmi}} of [[Center City, Philadelphia|Center City]] to the roughly {{convert|134|sqmi}} of [[Philadelphia County, Pennsylvania|Philadelphia County]].<ref>{{cite web

By the 20th century, Philadelphia had an entrenched [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] [[political machine]] and a complacent population.<ref>''Philadelphia: A 300-Year History'', pages 535, 537</ref> The first major reform came in 1917 when outrage over the election-year murder of a police officer led to the shrinking of the [[Philadelphia City Council|City Council]] from two houses to just one.<ref>''Philadelphia: A 300-Year History'', pages 563 – 564</ref> In July 1919, Philadelphia was one of more than 36 industrial cities nationally to suffer a race riot of ethnic whites against blacks during [[Red Summer]], in post-World War I unrest, as recent immigrants competed with blacks for jobs. In the 1920s, the public flouting of [[Prohibition in the United States|Prohibition]] laws, [[organized crime]], mob violence, and police involvement in illegal activities led to the appointment of [[Brigadier general|Brig. Gen.]] [[Smedley Butler]] of the [[United States Marine Corps|U.S. Marine Corps]] as director of public safety, but political pressure prevented any long-term success in fighting crime and corruption.<ref>''Philadelphia: A 300-Year History'', pages 578 – 581</ref>

In addition, [[suburbanization]] had enticed many of the more affluent residents to outlying railroad commuting towns and newer housing. The resulting reduction in Philadelphia's tax base and the resources of local government caused the city to struggle through a long period of adjustment, with it approaching bankruptcy by the late 1980s.<ref>{{Cite journal|url = http://www.picapa.org/docs/OW/19961015_A_Foreboding_Future_for_Philadelphia.pdf|title = Continuing Economic Decline: A Foreboding Future for Philadelphia|last = |first = |date = October 15, 1996|journal = White Paper|access-date = September 29, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title = Philadelphia's Changing Middle Class: After Decades of Decline, Prospects for Growth|url = http://www.pewtrusts.org/en/research-and-analysis/reports/2014/02/24/philadelphias-changing-middle-class-after-decades-of-decline-prospects-for-growth|website = www.pewtrusts.org|accessdate = September 29, 2015}}</ref>

Revitalization and [[gentrification]] of neighborhoods began in the late 1970s and continues into the 21st century, with much of the development occurring in the [[Center City, Philadelphia|Center City]] and [[University City, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania|University City]] neighborhoods. After many of the old manufacturers and businesses left Philadelphia or shut down, the city started attracting service businesses and began to market itself more aggressively as a tourist destination. Contemporary glass-and-granite skyscrapers were built in Center City beginning in the 1980s. Historic areas such as [[Old City, Philadelphia|Old City]] and [[Society Hill]] were renovated during the reformist mayoral era of the 1950s through the 1980s, making those areas among the most desirable neighborhoods in Center City. These developments have begun a reversal of the city's population decline between 1950 and 2000 during which it lost about one-quarter of its residents.<ref>''Insight Guides: Philadelphia and Surroundings'', pages 44–45</ref><ref>''A Concise History of Philadelphia'', page 78</ref> The city eventually began experiencing a growth in its population in 2007, which has continued with gradual yearly increases to the present.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20130319073844/http://www.philly.com/philly/news/197903331.html "Census: Phila. keeps on growing" (archive)]. by Dylan Purcell and Karie Simmons.

[[Center City, Philadelphia|Center City]] is structured with long straight streets running nearly due east-west and north-south, forming a grid pattern between the [[Delaware River|Delaware]] and [[Schuylkill River|Schuylkill]] rivers that is aligned with their courses. The original city plan was designed to allow for easy travel and to keep residences separated by open space that would help prevent the spread of fire.<ref name="Philadelphia Squares">{{cite web |url=http://philadelphia.cbslocal.com/2011/02/04/a-guide-to-philadelphias-squares/ |title=A Guide To Philadelphia's 'Squares' |publisher=CBS Philly |date=February 4, 2011 |accessdate=April 29, 2015 |author=Daly, Molly}}</ref> Penn planned the creation of five public parks in the city which were renamed in 1824<ref name="Philadelphia Squares" /> (new names in parentheses): Centre Square (Penn Square),<ref>[https://www.philadelphiabuildings.org/pab/app/pj_display.cfm/20977 "Philadelphia City Hall location"].

Philadelphia's neighborhoods are divided into large sections—[[North Philadelphia|North]], [[Northeast Philadelphia|Northeast]], [[South Philadelphia|South]], [[Southwest Philadelphia]], [[West Philadelphia|West]], and [[Northwest Philadelphia|Northwest]]—surrounding Center City, which corresponds closely with the city's limits before consolidation in 1854. Each of these large areas contains numerous neighborhoods, some of whose boundaries derive from the boroughs, townships, and other communities that constituted Philadelphia County before their inclusion within the city.<ref>{{Cite book |title=Insight Guides: Philadelphia and Surroundings |page=58}}</ref>

The [[City Planning Commission (Philadelphia)|City Planning Commission]], tasked with guiding growth and development of the city, has divided the city into 18 planning districts as part of the ''Philadelphia2035'' physical development plan.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://phila2035.org/home-page/about/ |title=About Philadelphia2035 |accessdate=April 29, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.phila.gov/CityPlanning/plans/Pages/Phila2035.aspx |title=Philadelphia 2035: The Comprehensive Plan |publisher=Philadelphia City Planning Commission |accessdate=April 29, 2015}}</ref> Much of the city's 1980 zoning code was overhauled from 2007 to 2012 as part of a joint effort between former mayors [[John F. Street]] and [[Michael Nutter]]. The zoning changes were intended to rectify incorrect zoning maps in order to facilitate future community development, as the city forecasts an additional 100,000 residents and 40,000 jobs will be added by 2035.

The [[Philadelphia Housing Authority]] is the largest landlord in Pennsylvania. Established in 1937, it is the nation's fourth-largest housing authority, housing about 84,000 people and employing 1,250.

[[File:OneLiberyPlacePhiladelphia cropped.jpg|thumb|upright|Juxtaposition of architectural styles in [[Center City, Philadelphia|Center City]], showing [[Liberty Place#One Liberty Place|One Liberty Place]] and [[Philadelphia City Hall|City Hall]]]]
Philadelphia's architectural history dates back to [[Colonial history of the United States|colonial]] times and includes a wide range of styles. The earliest structures were constructed with [[Log house|logs]], but brick structures were common by 1700. During the 18th century, the [[cityscape]] was dominated by [[Georgian architecture]], including [[Independence Hall]] and [[Christ Church, Philadelphia|Christ Church]].

In the first decades of the 19th century, [[Federal architecture|Federal]] and [[Greek Revival architecture]] were the dominant styles produced by Philadelphia architects such as [[Benjamin Henry Latrobe|Benjamin Latrobe]], [[William Strickland (architect)|William Strickland]], [[John Haviland]], [[John Notman]], [[Thomas Ustick Walter|Thomas Walter]], and [[Samuel Sloan (architect)|Samuel Sloan]].<ref name=Philadelphia-Page251>{{Cite book |title=Philadelphia: A 300-Year History |pages=11, 41, 174–175, 251–253}}</ref> [[Frank Furness]] is considered Philadelphia's greatest architect of the second half of the 19th century. His contemporaries included [[John McArthur Jr.]], [[Addison Hutton]], [[Wilson Eyre]], the [[Wilson Brothers & Company|Wilson Brothers]], and [[Horace Trumbauer]]. In 1871, construction began on the [[Second Empire architecture|Second Empire]]-style [[Philadelphia City Hall]]. The [[Philadelphia Historical Commission]] was created in 1955 to preserve the cultural and architectural history of the city. The commission maintains the [[Philadelphia Register of Historic Places]], adding historic buildings, structures, sites, objects and districts as it sees fit.<ref name="PNC">{{cite web |url=http://www.phila.gov/historical/ |title=Philadelphia Historical Commission |publisher=Phila.gov |accessdate=April 11, 2009}}</ref>

In 1932, Philadelphia became home to the first modern [[International Style (architecture)|International Style]] skyscraper in the United States, the [[PSFS Building]], designed by [[George Howe (architect)|George Howe]] and [[William Lescaze]]. The {{convert|548|ft|m|0|abbr=on}} City Hall remained the tallest building in the city until 1987 when [[Liberty Place#One Liberty Place|One Liberty Place]] was completed. Numerous glass and granite skyscrapers were built in Center City beginning in the late 1980s. In 2007, the [[Comcast Center]] surpassed One Liberty Place to become the city's tallest building. The [[Comcast Technology Center]] was completed in 2018, reaching a height of {{convert|1121|ft|m|0|abbr=on}}, as the [[List of tallest buildings in the United States|tallest building in the United States]] outside of [[Manhattan]] and [[Chicago]].<ref name=Comcast2/>

For much of Philadelphia's history, the typical home has been the [[Terraced house|row house]]. The row house was introduced to the United States via Philadelphia in the early 19th century and, for a time, row houses built elsewhere in the United States were known as "Philadelphia rows".<ref name=Philadelphia-Page251/> A variety of row houses are found throughout the city, from Federal-style continuous blocks in [[Old City, Philadelphia|Old City]] and [[Society Hill]] to Victorian-style homes in [[North Philadelphia]] to twin row houses in [[West Philadelphia]]. While newer homes have been built recently, much of the housing dates to the 18th, 19th and early 20th centuries, which has created problems such as [[urban decay]] and vacant lots. Some neighborhoods, including [[Northern Liberties, Philadelphia|Northern Liberties]] and [[Society Hill]], have been rehabilitated through [[gentrification]].<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Aitken |first=Joanne |title=Breaking Ground |journal=Philadelphia City Paper |date=June 3–19, 2004 |url=http://www.citypaper.net/articles/2004-06-03/cityspace.shtml |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160113222258/http://citypaper.net/articles/2004-06-03/cityspace.shtml |archivedate=January 13, 2016 |df=mdy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |author=Mark Alan Hughes |title=Dirt Into Dollars; Converting Vacant Land Into Valuable Development |url=http://www.brookings.edu/research/articles/2000/06/summer-metropolitanpolicy-hughes |date=June 1, 2000 |accessdate=December 24, 2013}}</ref>

The estimated average population density was 11,782 people per square&nbsp;mile (4,549/km²) in 2017. In 2010, the Census Bureau reported that 1,468,623 people (96.2% of the population) lived in households, 38,007 (2.5%) lived in non-institutionalized group quarters, and 19,376 (1.3%) were institutionalized.<ref name="Gen Pop/Housing"/> In 2013, the city reported having 668,247 total housing units, down slightly from 670,171 housing units in 2010. {{As of|2013}}, 87 percent of housing units were occupied, while 13 percent were vacant, a slight change from 2010 where 89.5 percent of units were occupied, or 599,736 and 10.5 percent were vacant, or 70,435.<ref name="Gen Pop/Housing"/><ref name = "State of the City 2015"/> Of the city's residents, 32 percent reported having no vehicles available while 23 percent had two or more vehicles available, {{As of|2013|lc=y}}.<ref name = "State of the City 2015"/>

The city reported 34.1 percent of all households were individuals living alone, while 10.5 percent had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 2.45 and the average family size was 3.20.<ref name="Gen Pop/Housing"/> In 2013, the percentage of women who gave birth in the previous 12 months who were unmarried was 56 percent. Of Philadelphia's adults, 31 percent were married or lived as a couple, 55 percent were not married, 11 percent were divorced or separated, and 3 percent were widowed.<ref name = "State of the City 2015"/>

According to the Census Bureau, the median household income in 2013 was $36,836, down 7.9 percent from 2008 when the [[inflation]]-adjusted median household income was $40,008 (in 2013 dollars). For comparison, on an inflation-adjusted basis, the median household income among metropolitan areas was $60,482, down 8.2 percent in the same period, and the national median household income was $55,250, down 7.0 percent from 2008.<ref name = "State of the City 2015"/> The city's wealth disparity is evident when neighborhoods are compared.

During the last decade, Philadelphia experienced a large shift in its age profile. In 2000, the city's [[population pyramid]] had a largely stationary shape. In 2013, the city took on an expansive pyramid shape, with an increase in the three [[millennials|millennial]] age groups, 20 to 24, 25 to 29, and 30 to 34. The city's 25- to 29-year-old age group was the city's largest age cohort.<ref name = "State of the City 2015"/> According to the 2010 Census, 343,837 (22.5%) were under the age of 18; 203,697 (13.3%) from 18 to 24; 434,385 (28.5%) from 25 to 44; 358,778 (23.5%) from 45 to 64; and 185,309 (12.1%) who were 65 years of age or older.

Philadelphia's death rate was at its lowest in at least a half-century, 13,691 deaths in 2013.<ref name = "State of the City 2015"/> Another factor attributing to the population increase is Philadelphia's rising [[immigration rate]]. Like the millennial population, Philadelphia's [[immigration|immigrant]] population is also growing rapidly; according to a study by the [[Pew Charitable Trusts]], the city's [[foreign born|foreign-born]] population had increased by 69% between 2000 and 2016 to constitute nearly 20% of Philadelphia's work force.<ref name=PhiladelphiaImmigrants>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/20/nyregion/philadelphia-new-york-migration-immigrants.html|title=Leaving New York to Find the American Dream in Philadelphia|author=Matt Katz|newspaper=The New York Times|date=July 20, 2018|accessdate=August 6, 2018}}</ref>

In 1815, Philadelphia began sourcing its water via the [[Fairmount Water Works]] located on the [[Schuylkill River]], the nation's first major urban water supply system. In 1909, the Water Works was decommissioned as the city transitioned to modern [[Sand filter|sand filtration]] methods.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://fairmountworks.com/our-story/ | title=Fairmount Water Works: Our Story | publisher=Fairmount Water Works | accessdate=April 24, 2015}}</ref> Today, the [[Philadelphia Water Department]] (PWD) provides [[drinking water]], [[wastewater]] collection, and [[stormwater]] services for Philadelphia, as well as surrounding counties. PWD draws about 57 percent of its drinking water from the [[Delaware River]] and the balance from the Schuylkill River.<ref name="PWD">{{cite web | url=http://www.phila.gov/water/aboutus/Pages/AboutPhiladelphiaWater.aspx | title=About Philadelphia Water | publisher=City of Philadelphia | accessdate=April 24, 2015}}</ref> The city has two filtration plants on the Schuylkill River and one on the Delaware River. The three plants can treat up to 546 million gallons of water per day, while the total storage capacity of the combined plant and distribution system exceeds one billion gallons. The wastewater system consists of three water pollution control plants, 21 pumping stations, and about {{convert|3657|mi|km}} of sewers.<ref name="PWD"/>

[[Exelon]] subsidiary [[PECO Energy Company]], founded as the Brush Electric Light Company of Philadelphia in 1881 and renamed Philadelphia Electric Company (PECO) in 1902, provides electricity to about 1.6 million customers and more than 500,000 [[natural gas]] customers in the southeastern Pennsylvania area including the city of Philadelphia and most of its suburbs.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.peco.com/AboutUs/Pages/CompanyInformation.aspx | title=PECO: Company Information | publisher=PECO Energy Company | accessdate=January 29, 2017}}</ref> PECO is the largest electric and natural gas utility in the state with 472 power substations and nearly {{convert|23000|mi|km}} of electric transmission and distribution lines, along with {{convert|12000|mi|km}} of natural gas transmission, distribution & service lines.<ref>[https://www.peco.com/SiteCollectionDocuments/PECO_Investing_in_our_Community_Booklet.pdf "PECO_Investing_in_our_Community_Booklet"]. page 2.

[[Philadelphia Gas Works]] (PGW), overseen by the [[Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission]], is the nation's largest municipally-owned natural gas utility. PGW serves over 500,000 homes and businesses in the Philadelphia area.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.pgworks.com/residential/about-us/about-pgw | title=PGW: About Us | publisher=Philadelphia Gas Works | accessdate=April 24, 2015}}</ref> Founded in 1836, the company came under city ownership in 1987 and has been providing the majority of gas distributed within city limits. In 2014, the [[Philadelphia City Council|City Council]] refused to conduct hearings on a $1.86 billion sale of PGW, part of a two-year effort that was proposed by the mayor. The refusal led to the prospective buyer terminating its offer.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://articles.philly.com/2014-10-28/news/55525996_1_concentric-energy-advisors-city-council-uil-holdings-corp | title=$1.86B sale of Philadelphia Gas Works is dead | work=The Philadelphia Inquirer | date=October 28, 2014 | accessdate=April 24, 2015 | author=Maykuth, Andrew | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150512113604/http://articles.philly.com/2014-10-28/news/55525996_1_concentric-energy-advisors-city-council-uil-holdings-corp | archivedate=May 12, 2015 | deadurl=yes}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last1=Hepp|first1=Chris|title=PGW deal latest casualty in Philly's Nutter-and-Clarke soap opera|url=http://articles.philly.com/2014-12-08/news/56806983_1_uil-philadelphia-gas-works-community-meeting|accessdate=May 25, 2015|work=The Philadelphia Inquirer|date=December 8, 2014|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150516023824/http://articles.philly.com/2014-12-08/news/56806983_1_uil-philadelphia-gas-works-community-meeting|archivedate=May 16, 2015|deadurl=yes}}</ref>

Southeastern Pennsylvania was assigned the [[area code 215|215]] [[area code]] in 1947 when the [[North American Numbering Plan]] of the [[Bell System]] went into effect. The geographic area covered by the code was split nearly in half in 1994 when [[area code 610]] was created, with the city and its northern suburbs retaining 215. [[area code overlay|Overlay area code]] 267 was added to the 215 service area in 1997, and 484 was added to the 610 area in 1999. A plan in 2001 to introduce a third overlay code to both service areas ([[area code 445]] to 215, [[area code 835]] to 610) was delayed and later rescinded.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.nanpa.com/pdf/PL_332_v1.pdf |title=PA 445 Implementation for 215/267 NPA Rescinded – 445 NPA Code Reclaimed }}&nbsp;{{small|(64.5&nbsp;KB)}}</ref> Area code 445 was implemented as an overlay for area codes 215 and 267 starting on February 3, 2018.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://6abc.com/home/445-philadelphia-suburbs-getting-new-area-code/3011823/ |title=445: Philadelphia, suburbs getting new area code (Pennsylvania)}}&nbsp;{{small|(1.1&nbsp;[[Mebibyte|MiB]])}}</ref>

In 2005, a low-cost, citywide [[Wi-Fi]] service was approved for installation in the city. Wireless Philadelphia would have been the first municipal internet utility in a large U.S. city, but the plan was abandoned in 2008 as [[EarthLink]] pushed back the completion date several times. Mayor Nutter's administration closed the project in 2009 after an attempt to revitalize it failed.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://technical.ly/project/wireless-philadelphia/ | title=Wireless Philadelphia | publisher=Technically | accessdate=April 24, 2015}}</ref>

Philadelphia has dedicated landmarks to its sister cities. The Sister Cities Park, a site of {{convert|0.5|acre|sqyd}} located at 18th and [[Benjamin Franklin Parkway]] within [[Logan Circle (Philadelphia)|Logan Square]], was dedicated in June 1976. The park was built to commemorate Philadelphia's first two sister city relationships, with [[Tel Aviv]] and [[Florence]]. The Toruń Triangle, honoring the sister city relationship with [[Toruń]], Poland, was constructed in 1976, west of the [[United Way of America|United Way]] building at 18th Street and the Benjamin Franklin Parkway. Sister Cities Park was redesigned and reopened in 2012, featuring an interactive fountain honoring Philadelphia's sister and partnership cities, a café and visitor's center, children's play area, outdoor garden, and boat pond, as well as a pavilion built to [[environmentally friendly]] standards.<ref name="renovation">{{cite web | url=http://www.ivc.org/sister_cities_park | title=Sister Cities Park |website=ivc.org | publisher=International Visitors Council of Philadelphia | accessdate=June 3, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=http://centercityphila.org/parks/sister-cities-park/sister-cities-park-history | title=Sister Cities Park History |website=centercityphila.org | publisher=Center City District{{!}}Central Philadelphia Development Corporation{{!}}Center City District Foundation | accessdate=December 16, 2017}}</ref>
