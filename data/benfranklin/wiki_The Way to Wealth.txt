'''''The Way to Wealth''''' is an essay written by [[Benjamin Franklin]] in 1758. It is a collection of adages and advice presented in ''[[Poor Richard's Almanac]]'' during its first 25 years of publication, organized into a speech given by "Father Abraham" to a group of people. Many of the phrases Father Abraham quotes continue to be familiar today. The essay's advice is based on the themes of [[work ethic]] and frugality.

Some phrases from the almanac quoted in ''The Way to Wealth'' include:
* "There are no gains, without pains"
* "One today is worth two tomorrows"
* "A life of leisure and a life of laziness are two things"
* "Get what you can, and what you get hold"
* "Sloth, like rust, consumes faster than labor wears, while the used key is always bright"
* "Have you somewhat to do tomorrow, do it today"
* "The eye of a master will do more work than both his hands"
* "Early to bed, and early to rise, makes a man healthy, wealthy and wise"
* [[For Want of a Nail (proverb)|"For want of a nail..."]]
