==History==
The Philadelphia Contributionship was founded in 1752, largely through the efforts of [[Benjamin Franklin]].  It was structured as a [[mutual insurance]] organization, providing fire insurance to a limited area in and around Philadelphia.  It introduced several key principles that underpin modern insurance techniques, including inspecting properties to be insured, and setting rates based on a risk assessment.  Buildings that were not constructed to specified standards were rejected for coverage, and rates could be raised for unsafe living practices, such as the storage of combustible materials in wooden buildings.  The company also was the first to establish a financial reserve from which to pay claims.<ref name="nrhpinv2"/>

Franklin's newspaper, ''[[The Pennsylvania Gazette]]'', first began to advertise the upcoming (April 13, 1752) organizational meeting in its issue of February 18, with a notice that "All persons inclined to subscribe to the articles of insurance of houses from fire, in or near this city, are desired to appear at the Court-house, where attendance will be given, to take in their subscriptions, every seventh day of the week, in the afternoon, until the 13th of April next, being the day appointed by the said articles for electing twelve directors and a treasurer."  <ref>''The Pennsylvania Gazette'', February 18, 1752, p2</ref><ref>''The Pennsylvania Gazette'', March 17, 1752, p2</ref>

The company directors at first met in taverns and other public meeting spaces, with larger organizational meetings taking place at the courthouse.  Its directors finally purchased land for a permanent headquarters in 1835.  Although the company has not innovated in insurance practices since its early days, it continues to function as an insurer in the Philadelphia area.<ref name="nrhpinv2"/>
