The '''Founding Fathers of the United States''', or simply the '''Founding Fathers''', were a group of [[philosopher]]s, [[politician]]s, and [[writer]]s who led the [[American Revolution]] against the [[Kingdom of Great Britain]]. Most were descendants of colonists settled in the [[Thirteen Colonies]] in [[North America]].

Historian [[Richard B. Morris]] in 1973 identified the following seven figures as the key Founding Fathers: [[Alexander Hamilton]], [[John Adams]], [[Benjamin Franklin]], [[John Jay]], [[Thomas Jefferson]], [[James Madison]] and [[George Washington]].<ref name="MorrisSeven">Richard B.

All held additional important roles in the early government of the United States, with Washington, Adams, Jefferson, and Madison serving as President. Jay was the nation's first Chief Justice, Hamilton was the first [[Secretary of the Treasury]], and Franklin was America's most senior diplomat, and later the governmental leader of [[Pennsylvania]].

The term Founding Fathers is sometimes used to refer to [[Signing of the United States Declaration of Independence|the Signers]] of the embossed version of the Declaration of Independence in 1776.<ref>{{cite web|title=Signers of the Declaration|url=http://www.nps.gov/history/history/online_books/declaration|publisher=National Park Service, U.S. Department of the Interior|access-date=April 7, 2017}}</ref> ''Signers'' should not be confused with the term ''Framers''; the Framers are defined by the [[National Archives and Records Administration|National Archives]] as those 55 individuals who were appointed to be delegates to the 1787 [[Constitutional Convention (United States)|Constitutional Convention]] and took part in drafting the proposed [[Constitution of the United States]].

The phrase "Founding Fathers" is a 20th-century appellation, coined by [[Warren G. Harding]] in 1916. Prior to, and during the 19th century, they were referred to as simply the "Fathers". The term has  been used to describe the founders and first settlers of the original royal colonies.<ref>{{Cite book|last1=Parham|first1=C.

==Background==
[[File:Albany Congress.jpeg|thumb|upright|The [[Albany Congress]] of 1754 was a conference attended by seven colonies, which presaged later efforts at cooperation. The [[Stamp Act Congress]] of 1765 included representatives from nine colonies.]]

The [[First Continental Congress]] met briefly in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania in 1774, consisting of fifty-six delegates from twelve of the [[thirteen colonies]] (not including [[Province of Georgia|Georgia]]) that became the United States of America. Among them was [[George Washington]], who would soon be drawn out of military retirement to command the [[Continental Army]] during the [[American Revolutionary War]]. Also in attendance was [[Patrick Henry]], and [[John Adams]], who like all delegates were elected by their respective colonial assemblies. Other delegates included [[Samuel Adams]] from Massachusetts, [[John Dickinson (politician)|John Dickinson]] from Pennsylvania and New York's [[John Jay]]. This congress in addition to formulating appeals to the British crown, established the [[Continental Association]] to administer boycott actions against Britain.

When the [[Second Continental Congress]] convened on May 10, 1775, it essentially reconstituted the First Congress. Many of the same 56 delegates who attended the first meeting participated in the second.<ref>Burnett, ''Continental Congress'', 64–67.</ref> New arrivals included [[Benjamin Franklin]] and [[Robert Morris (financier)|Robert Morris]] of Pennsylvania, [[John Hancock]] of Massachusetts, and [[John Witherspoon]] of New Jersey. Hancock was elected Congress President two weeks into the session when [[Peyton Randolph]] was recalled to Virginia to preside over the [[House of Burgesses]]. [[Thomas Jefferson]] replaced Randolph in the Virginia congressional delegation.<ref>Fowler, ''Baron of Beacon Hill'', 189.</ref> The second Congress adopted the [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]]. Witherspoon was the only active clergyman to sign the Declaration. He also signed the [[Articles of Confederation]] and attended the New Jersey (1787) convention that ratified the Federal Constitution.<ref>{{cite web|title=Signers of the Declaration|url=http://www.nps.gov/history/history/online_books/declaration/bio54.htm|publisher=National Park Service, U.S. Department of the Interior|accessdate=April 24, 2014|page=Biography #54}}</ref>

The newly founded country of the United States had to create a new government to replace the [[Parliament of Great Britain|British Parliament]]. The U.S. adopted the Articles of Confederation, a declaration that established a national government with a one-house legislature. Its ratification by all thirteen colonies gave the second Congress a new name: the [[Congress of the Confederation]], which met from 1781 to 1789.<ref name="Confederation Congress, Ohio Historical Society">{{cite web |url=http://ohiohistorycentral.org/entry.php?rec=2327 |title=Confederation Congress |publisher=Ohio Historical Society |accessdate=October 23, 2010}}</ref> The [[Constitutional Convention (United States)|Constitutional Convention]] took place during the summer of 1787, in Philadelphia.<ref name=Jillson2009>{{cite book|title=American Government: Political Development and Institutional Change|author=Calvin C. Jillson|edition=5th|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|year=2009|isbn=978-0-203-88702-8|page=31}}</ref> Although the Convention was called to revise the Articles of Confederation, the intention from the outset for some including [[James Madison]] and [[Alexander Hamilton]] was to create a new frame of government rather than amending the existing one. The delegates elected George Washington to preside over the Convention. The result of the Convention was the [[United States Constitution]] and the replacement of the Continental Congress with the [[United States Congress]].

The Founding Fathers represented a cross-section of 18th-century U.S. leadership. According to a study of the biographies by Caroline Robbins: 
:The  Signers came for the most part from an educated elite, were residents of  older settlements, and belonged with a few exceptions to a moderately  well-to-do class representing only a fraction of the population. Native  or born overseas, they were of British stock and of the Protestant faith.<ref>Caroline Robbins,  "Decision in '76: Reflections on the 56 Signers." ''Proceedings of the Massachusetts Historical Society''. Vol. 89  pp 72-87, quote  at p 86</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last1=Brown |first1=Richard D. |title=The Founding Fathers of 1776 and 1787: A Collective View |journal=The William and Mary Quarterly |date=July 1976 |volume=33 |issue=3 |pages=465 |doi=10.2307/1921543}}</ref>

Almost all of them were leaders in their communities. Many were also prominent in national affairs. Virtually every one had taken part in the [[American Revolution]]; at least 29 had served in the [[Continental Army]], most of them in positions of command. Scholars have examined the collective biography of them as well as the signers of the Declaration and the Constitution.<ref>See Brown (19764); Martin (19739); "Data on the Framers of the Constitution," at [http://www.usconstitution.net/constframedata.html]</ref>

===Education===
Many of the Founding Fathers attended or held degrees from the [[colonial colleges]], most notably [[Columbia University|Columbia]] known at the time as "King's College", [[Princeton University|Princeton]] originally known as "The College of New Jersey", [[Harvard|Harvard College]], the [[College of William and Mary]], [[Yale|Yale College]] and [[University of Pennsylvania]]. Some had previously been home schooled or obtained early instruction from private tutors or academies.<ref>Brown (1976); Harris (1969)</ref> Others had studied abroad. Ironically, Benjamin Franklin who had little formal education himself would ultimately establish the [[University of Pennsylvania|College of Philadelphia]] based on European models (1740); "Penn" would have the first medical school (1765) in the thirteen colonies where another Founder, [[Benjamin Rush]] would eventually teach.

With a limited number of professional schools established in the U.S., Founders also sought advanced degrees from traditional institutions in England and Scotland such as the [[University of Edinburgh]], the [[University of St. Andrews]], and the [[University of Glasgow]].

====Colonial colleges attended====
* College of William and Mary: Thomas Jefferson<ref>{{cite web|title=The Alma Maters of Our Founding Fathers|access-date=April 7, 2017|url=https://www.universitylanguage.com/blog/02/the-alma-maters-of-our-founding-fathers/}}</ref>

====Advanced degrees and apprenticeships====
=====Doctors of Medicine=====
* University of Edinburgh: Rush <ref>{{cite web|publisher=Penn University Archives and Records Center|title=Benjamin Rush (1746 - 1813) access-date=April 9, 2017|url=http://www.archives.upenn.edu/people/1700s/rush_benj.html}}</ref>
* University of Utrecht, Netherlands: Williamson

=====[[Theology]]=====
* University of Edinburgh: Witherspoon (attended, no degree)
* University of St. Andrews: Witherspoon (honorary doctorate)

=====Legal apprenticeships=====

Several like John Jay, James Wilson, [[John Williams (Continental Congress)|John Williams]] and [[George Wythe]]<ref>{{cite web|title=George Wythe|publisher=Colonial Williamsburg|access-date=April 9, 2017|url=https://www.history.org/almanack/people/bios/biowythe.cfm}}</ref> were trained as lawyers through apprenticeships in the colonies while a few trained at the [[Inns of Court]] in London.

====Self-taught or little formal education====
Franklin, Washington, [[John Williams (Continental Congress)|John Williams]] and [[Henry Wisner]] had little formal education and were largely [[Autodidacticism|self-taught]] or learned through [[apprenticeship]].

===Demographics===
The great majority were born in the [[Thirteen Colonies]]. But at least nine were born other parts of the British Empire:
* [[England]]: Robert Morris, Button Gwinnett
* [[Kingdom of Ireland|Ireland]]: Butler, Fitzsimons, McHenry and Paterson
* [[Nevis|West Indies]]: Hamilton
* [[Scotland]]: Wilson and Witherspoon

Many of them had moved from one colony to another. Eighteen had already lived, studied or worked in more than one colony: Baldwin, Bassett, Bedford, Davie, Dickinson, Few, Franklin, Ingersoll, Hamilton, Livingston, Alexander Martin, Luther Martin, Mercer, Gouverneur Morris, Robert Morris, Read, Sherman, and Williamson.

Several others had studied or traveled abroad.

===Occupations===
The Founding Fathers practiced a wide range of [[Occupational prestige|high and middle-status occupations]], and many pursued more than one career simultaneously. They did not differ dramatically from the [[Loyalist (American Revolution)|Loyalists]], except they were generally younger and less senior in their professions.<ref name="Greene 1973">Greene (1973).</ref>
* As many as thirty-five including Adams, Hamilton and Jay were trained as lawyers though not all of them practiced law. Some had also been local judges.<ref name="Brown 1976">Brown (1976).</ref>
* Washington trained as a land surveyor before he became commander of a small militia.
* At the time of the convention, 13 men were merchants: Blount, Broom, Clymer, Dayton, Fitzsimons, Shields, Gilman, Gorham, Langdon, Robert Morris, Pierce, Sherman and Wilson.
* Broom and Few were small farmers.
* Three had retired from active economic endeavors: Franklin, McHenry and Mifflin.
* Franklin and Williamson were scientists, in addition to their other activities.
* McClurg, McHenry, Rush and Williamson were physicians.
* Johnson and Witherspoon were college presidents.

===Finances===

Historian [[Caroline Robbins]] in 1977 examined the status of the Signers of the Declaration of Independence and concluded:
:There were indeed disparities of wealth, earned or inherited: some Signers were rich, others had about enough to enable them to attend Congress....The majority of revolutionaries were from  moderately well-to-do or average income brackets. Twice as many Loyalists belonged to the wealthiest echelon. But some Signers were rich; few, indigent.... The Signers were elected not for wealth or rank so much as because of the evidence they had already evinced of willingness for public service.<ref>Caroline Robbins, "Decision in '76: Reflections on the 56 Signers" ''Proceedings of the Massachusetts Historical Society'' Vol. 89 (1977), pp. 72-87 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/25080810 online] quoting page 83.</ref> A few of them were wealthy or had financial resources that ranged from good to excellent, but there are other founders who were less than wealthy. On the whole they were less wealthy than the Loyalists.<ref name="Greene 1973"/>
* Seven were major land speculators: Blount, Dayton, Fitzsimmons, Gorham, Robert Morris, Washington, and Wilson.
* Eleven speculated in securities on a large scale: Bedford, Blair, Clymer, Dayton, Fitzsimons, Franklin, King, Langdon, Robert Morris, Charles Cotesworth Pinckney, and Sherman.
* Many derived income from [[Plantations in the American South|plantations]] or large farms which they owned or managed, which relied upon the labor of enslaved men and women particularly in the southern colonies: Bassett, Blair, Blount, Davie,<ref name="William R. Davie 1957">William R. Davie, Blackwell P. Robinson. The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, 1957.</ref> Johnson, Butler, Carroll, Jefferson, Jenifer, Madison, Mason, Charles Pinckney, [[Charles Cotesworth Pinckney]], Rutledge, Spaight, and Washington.
* Eight of the men received a substantial part of their income from public office: Baldwin, Blair, Brearly, Gilman, Livingston, Madison, and Rutledge.

===Prior political experience===
Several of the Founding Fathers had extensive national, state, local and foreign political experience prior to the adoption of the Constitution in 1787. Some had been diplomats. Several had been members of the [[Continental Congress]] or elected President of that body.
* [[Benjamin Franklin]] began his political career as a city councilman and then Justice of the Peace in Philadelphia. He was next elected to the [[Pennsylvania Assembly]] and was sent by them to London as a colonial agent which helped hone his diplomatic skills.
* [[Thomas Jefferson|Jefferson]], [[John Adams|Adams]], [[John Jay|Jay]] and [[Benjamin Franklin|Franklin]] all acquired significant political experience as ministers to countries in Europe.
* [[John Adams]] and [[John Jay]] drafted the Constitutions of their respective states, Massachusetts and New York, and successfully navigated them through to adoption.
* Jay, [[Thomas Mifflin]] and [[Nathaniel Gorham]] had served as [[President of the Continental Congress]].
* [[Gouverneur Morris]] had been a member of the [[New York Provincial Congress]].
* [[John Dickinson]], Franklin, Langdon, and Rutledge had been governors or presidents of their states.
* [[Robert Morris (financier)|Robert Morris]] had been a member of the [[Pennsylvania Assembly]] and President of Pennsylvania's [[Committee of Safety (American Revolution)]]. He was also a member of the [[Committee of Secret Correspondence]].
* [[Roger Sherman]] had served in the [[Connecticut House of Representatives]].
* [[Elbridge Gerry]] was a member of the [[Massachusetts Provincial Congress]].
* [[Daniel Carroll|Carroll]] served in the [[Maryland Senate]].
* [[George Wythe|Wythe]]'s first exposure to politics was as a member of Virginia's [[House of Burgesses]].
* [[George Read (U.S. statesman)|Read]]'s entry into the political arena was as a commissioner of the town of Charlestown, Maryland.
* [[George Clymer|Clymer]] was a member of the Philadelphia Committee of Safety and the Continental Congress.
* [[James Wilson|Wilson]]'s time as a member of the Continental Congress in 1776 was his introduction to colonial politics.

Nearly all of the 55 Constitutional Convention delegates had some experience in colonial and state government, and the majority had held county and local offices.<ref>Martin (1973); Greene (1973)</ref> Those who lacked national congressional experience were [[Richard Bassett (politician)|Bassett]], [[John Blair Jr.|Blair]], [[David Brearly|Brearly]], [[Jacob Broom|Broom]], [[William Richardson Davie|Davie]], [[Jonathan Dayton|Dayton]], [[Alexander Martin]], [[Luther Martin]], [[George Mason|Mason]], [[James McClurg|McClurg]], [[William Paterson (judge)|Paterson]], [[Charles Pinckney (governor)|Charles Pinckney]], [[Caleb Strong|Strong]], and [[Robert Yates (politician)|Yates]].

===Religion===
Franklin T. Lambert (2003) has examined the religious affiliations and beliefs of some of the Founders. Of the 55 delegates to the 1787 Constitutional Convention, 28 were [[Anglicans]] (in the [[Church of England]]; or [[Episcopal Church in the United States of America|Episcopalian]], after the [[American Revolutionary War]] was won), 21 were [[Protestantism|Protestants]], and two were [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholics]] (D. Carroll, and Fitzsimons).<ref name="Lambert2003">{{cite book |title=The Founding Fathers and the Place of Religion in America |publisher=Princeton University Press |location=Princeton, NJ |last=Lambert |first=Franklin T. |authorlink=Franklin T.

A few prominent Founding Fathers were [[Anti-clericalism|anti-clerical]] Christians such as Thomas Jefferson,<ref>Letter to Alexander von Humboldt, December 6, 1813 "History, I believe, furnishes no example of a priest-ridden people maintaining a free civil government,"</ref><ref>Letter to Horatio G. Spafford, March 17, 1814 "In every country and in every age, the priest has been hostile to liberty. He is always in alliance with the despot, abetting his abuses in return for protection to his own."</ref><ref>[http://ecollege.edu/about-us/veritas-aeterna/383-religion-of-jefferson The Religion of Thomas Jefferson] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111123151450/http://ecollege.edu/about-us/veritas-aeterna/383-religion-of-jefferson |date=November 23, 2011 }} Retrieved July 9, 2011</ref> who constructed the ''[[Jefferson Bible]]'', and Benjamin Franklin.<ref>Quoted in The New England Currant (July 23, 1722), "Silence Dogood, No. 9; ''Corruptio optimi est pessima''." "And it is a sad Observation, that when the People too late see their Error, yet the Clergy still persist in their Encomiums on the Hypocrite; and when he happens to die for the Good of his Country, without leaving behind him the Memory of one good Action, he shall be sure to have his Funeral Sermon stuff'd with Pious Expressions which he dropt at such a Time, and at such a Place, and on such an Occasion; than which nothing can be more prejudicial to the Interest of Religion, nor indeed to the Memory of the Person deceas'd. The Reason of this Blindness in the Clergy is, because they are honourably supported (as they ought to be) by their People, and see nor feel nothing of the Oppression which is obvious and burdensome to every one else."</ref>

Historian Gregg L. Frazer argues that the leading Founders (John Adams, Jefferson, Franklin, Wilson, Morris, Madison, Hamilton, and Washington) were neither Christians nor Deists, but rather supporters of a hybrid "[[theistic rationalism]]".<ref>{{Cite book |title=The Religious Beliefs of America's Founders: Reason, Revelation, and Revolution |isbn=978-0700620210 |first=Gregg L. |last=Frazer |publisher=University Press of Kansas |date=2012 }}</ref>

Many Founders deliberately avoided public discussion of their faith. Historian [[David L. Holmes]] uses evidence gleaned from letters, government documents, and second- hand accounts to identify their religious beliefs.<ref>[[David L. Holmes]] in ''[[The Faiths of the Founding Fathers]]'' (Oxford University Press, 2006)</ref>

{{See also|George Washington and slavery|Thomas Jefferson and slavery}}
The founding fathers were not unified on the issue of slavery. In her study of [[Thomas Jefferson]], historian Annette Gordon-Reed discusses this topic, "Others of the founders held slaves, but no other founder drafted the charter for freedom".<ref name="Annette Gordon-Reed 2000 pp. 171-182">Annette Gordon-Reed, ''Engaging Jefferson: Blacks and the Founding Father'', The William and Mary Quarterly, Vol. 57, No. 1 (Jan., 2000), pp. 171-182</ref> In addition to Jefferson, [[George Washington]], [[John Jay]] and many other of the Founding Fathers practiced slavery but were also conflicted by the institution which many saw as immoral and politically divisive.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Founders and Slavery: John Jay Saves the Day|url=https://www.economist.com/blogs/democracyinamerica/2011/07/founders-and-slavery |publisher=The Economist|accessdate= April 5, 2017}}</ref>  Conversely, many founders such as [[Samuel Adams]] and [[John Adams]] were against slavery their entire lives.  [[Benjamin Rush]] wrote a pamphlet in 1773 which harshly condemned slavery and beseeched the colonists to petition the king and put an end to the British [[African Company of Merchants]] which kept slavery and the slave trade going.

Franklin, though he was a key founder of the [[Pennsylvania Abolition Society]]<ref name=Wright_p125>{{cite book |first=William D. |last=Wright |title=Critical Reflections on Black History |year=2002 |page=125|publisher=Praeger Publishers |location=[[Westport, Connecticut|West Port]], [[Connecticut]]}}</ref> originally owned slaves whom he later [[manumit]]ted. While serving in the Rhode Island Assembly, [[Stephen Hopkins (politician)|Stephen Hopkins]] introduced one of the earliest anti-slavery laws in the colonies, and [[John Jay]] would try unsuccessfully to abolish slavery as early as 1777 in the State of New York.<ref>The Selected Papers of John Jay, Columbia University, http://www.columbia.edu/cu/libraries/inside/dev/jay/JaySlavery.html</ref> He nonetheless founded the [[New York Manumission Society]] in 1785, for which Hamilton became an officer. They and other members of the Society founded the [[African Free School]] in New York City, to educate the children of free blacks and slaves. When Jay was governor of New York in 1798, he helped secure—an signed into law an abolition law; fully ending forced labor as of 1827. He freed his own slaves in 1798.

[[Slavery in the United States|Slaves and slavery]] are mentioned only indirectly in the 1787 Constitution.  For example, [[Three-Fifths Compromise|Article 1, Section 2, Clause 3]] prescribes that "three fifths of all other Persons" are to be counted for the apportionment of seats in the [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] and direct taxes.  Additionally, in [[Fugitive Slave Clause|Article 4, Section 2, Clause 3]], slaves are referred to as "persons held in service or labor".<ref name=Wright_p125/><ref name="Freehling_TAHR_p85"/> The Founding Fathers, however, did make important efforts to contain slavery. Many Northern states had adopted legislation to end or significantly reduce slavery during and after the American Revolution.<ref name="Freehling_TAHR_p85">{{cite journal |last=Freehling |first=William W. |title=The Founding Fathers and Slavery |date=February 1972 |journal=The American Historical Review |volume=77 |pages=81–93 |number=1 |doi=10.2307/1856595|jstor=1856595 }}</ref> In 1782 [[Virginia]] passed a [[manumission]] law that allowed slave owners to free their slaves by will or deed.<ref name=Cambridge_p278>{{cite book |title=The Cambridge History of Law in America| year=2008 |page=278}}</ref> As a result, thousands of slaves were manumitted in Virginia.<ref name=Cambridge_p278/> Thomas Jefferson, in 1784, proposed to ban slavery in all the Western Territories, which failed to pass Congress by one vote.<ref name="Freehling_TAHR_p85"/> Partially following Jefferson's plan, Congress did ban slavery in the [[Northwest Ordinance of 1787]], for lands north of the [[Ohio River]].<ref name="Freehling_TAHR_p85"/>

The [[Atlantic slave trade|international slave trade]] was banned in all states except [[South Carolina]], by 1800. Finally in 1807, President Jefferson called for and signed into law a Federally-enforced ban on the international slave trade throughout the U.S. and its territories. It became a federal crime to import or export a slave.<ref name="Freehling_TAHR_p85"/> However, the domestic [[slave trade]] was allowed, for expansion, or for diffusion of slavery into the [[Louisiana Territory]].<ref name=Freehling_TAHR_p85/>

===Attendance at conventions===
In the winter and spring of 1786–1787, twelve of the thirteen states chose a total of 74 delegates to attend the Constitutional Convention in Philadelphia. Nineteen delegates chose not to accept election or attend the debates; for example, [[Patrick Henry]] of Virginia thought that state politics were far more interesting and important than national politics, though during the ratification controversy of 1787–1788 he claimed, "I smelled a rat." Rhode Island did not send delegates because of its politicians' suspicions of the Convention delegates' motivations. As the colony was founded by [[Roger Williams (theologian)|Roger Williams]] as a sanctuary for [[Baptist]]s, Rhode Island's absence at the Convention in part explains the absence of Baptist affiliation among those who did attend. Of the 55 who did attend at some point, no more than 38 delegates showed up at one time.<ref>See the discussion of the Convention in Clinton L. Rossiter, ''1787: The Grand Convention'' (New York: Macmillan, 1966; reprint ed., with new foreword by Richard B. Morris, New York: W. W. Norton, 1987).</ref>

===Spouses and children===
Only four (Baldwin, Gilman, Jenifer, and Alexander Martin) were lifelong bachelors. Many of their spouses, like [[Eliza Schuyler Hamilton]], [[Martha Washington]], [[Abigail Adams]], Sarah Livingston Jay, [[Dolley Madison]], Mary White Morris and Catherine Alexander Duer were strong women who made significant contributions of their own to the fight for liberty.<ref name="Griswold, Rufus 1855">Griswold, Rufus (1855), ''The Republican Court, or, American Society in the Days of Washington'', D. Appleton & Co.</ref>

Sherman fathered the largest family: 15 children by two wives. At least nine (Bassett, Brearly, Johnson, Mason, Paterson, Charles Cotesworth Pinckney, Sherman, Wilson, and Wythe) married more than once. George Washington, "The Father of our Country,"<ref>{{cite web|author=George Washington's Mount Vernon|title=Father of His Country|access-date=April 6, 2017|url=http://www.mountvernon.org/digital-encyclopedia/article/father-of-his-country/}}</ref> had no biological descendants.

===Charters of freedom and historical documents of the United States===
The [[National Archives and Records Administration]] also known as NARA, defines U.S. Founding Documents, or [[Charters of Freedom]], as the Declaration of Independence (1776), The Constitution (1787) and the Bill of Rights (1791). These original instruments which represent the philosophy of the United States are housed in Washington, D.C. in the NARA Rotunda.<ref>{{cite web|author=National Archives|title=America's Founding Documents|access-date=April 6, 2017|url=https://www.archives.gov/founding-docs}}</ref>
The [[Library of Congress]] further identifies the Articles of Confederation, also preserved at NARA, as a primary U.S. document.<ref>{{cite web|publisher= Library of Congress|title=Articles of Confederation|access-date=April 10, 2017|url=https://www.loc.gov/rr/program/bib/ourdocs/articles.html}}</ref> The Articles of Confederation served as the first constitution of the United States until its replacement by the present Constitution on March 4, 1789.

===Post-constitution life===
Subsequent events in the lives of the Founding Fathers after the adoption of the Constitution were characterized by success or failure, reflecting the abilities of these men as well as the vagaries of fate.<ref>Martin (1973)</ref> Washington, Adams, Jefferson and Madison served in highest U.S. office of President. Jay would be appointed as Chief Justice of the United States and later elected to two terms as Governor of New York.

Seven (Fitzsimons, Gorham, Luther Martin, Mifflin, Robert Morris, Pierce, and Wilson) suffered serious financial reversals that left them in or near bankruptcy. Robert Morris spent three of the last years of his life imprisoned following bad land deals.<ref name="Griswold, Rufus 1855"/>
Two, Blount and Dayton, were involved in possibly treasonous activities. Yet, as they had done before the convention, most of the group continued to render public service, particularly to the new government they had helped to create.

===Youth and longevity===
[[File:Death Age-Founding Fathers.svg|thumb|left|upright=1.6|Death age of the Founding Fathers]]

Many of the Founding Fathers were under 40 years old at the time of the signing of the Declaration of Independence in 1776: [[Alexander Hamilton]] was 21, [[Aaron Burr]] was 20, [[Gouverneur Morris]] was 24. The oldest were Benjamin Franklin, 70, and [[Samuel Whittemore]], 81.<ref>{{cite web|author=Andrlik, Todd|title=How Old Were the Leaders of the American Revolution on July 4, 1776?|url= http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2013/08/how_old_were_the_founding_father_the_leaders_of_the_american_revolution.html}}</ref>

Secretary [[Charles Thomson]] lived to the age of 94. Johnson died at 92. John Adams lived to the age of 90. A few – Franklin, Jay, Jefferson, Madison, [[Hugh Williamson]], and [[George Wythe]] – lived into their eighties. Approximately 16 died in their seventies, 21 in their sixties, 8 in their fifties, and 5 in their forties. Three ([[Burr-Hamilton duel|Alexander Hamilton]], [[Richard Dobbs Spaight]] and [[Button Gwinnett]]) were killed in [[duel]]s.

Friends and political adversaries John Adams and Thomas Jefferson both died on the same day – July 4, 1826.<ref>{{cite web|author=History|title=Thomas Jefferson and John Adams Die|url=http://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/thomas-jefferson-and-john-adams-die}}</ref>

The last remaining founders, also called the "[[Last of the Romans]]", lived well into the nineteenth century.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Elizabeth Fox-Genovese|author2=Eugene D. Genovese|title=The Mind of the Master Class: History and Faith in the Southern Slaveholders' Worldview|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iaSeHEByLnUC&pg=PA278|year=2005|publisher=Cambridge University Press|page=278|isbn=9780521850650}}</ref>

===Institutions formed by Founders===
Several Founding Fathers were instrumental in establishing schools and societal institutions that still exist today:
* Franklin founded the University of Pennsylvania, while Jefferson founded the [[University of Virginia]].
* Rush founded Dickinson College and Franklin College, (today [[Franklin and Marshall]]) as well as the [[College of Physicians of Philadelphia]], the oldest medical society in America.
* Hamilton founded the ''[[New York Post]]'', as well as the [[United States Coast Guard]].
* [[Henry Knox|Knox]]<ref>{{cite web|publisher=Society of the Cincinnati|title=The Founding of the Society, 1783–1784|access-date=April 9, 2017|url=http://www.societyofthecincinnati.org/about/history/founding}}</ref> helped found the [[Society of the Cincinnati]] in 1783; the society was predicated on service as an officer in the Revolutionary War and heredity. Members included Washington, Hamilton and Burr. Other Founders like Sam Adams, John Adams, Franklin and Jay criticized the formation of what they considered to be an elitist body and threat to the Constitution. Franklin would later accept an honorary membership though Jay declined.<ref>{{cite web|title=History:The Society of the Cincinnati in the State of Connecticut|url=http://theconnecticutsociety.org/history/}}</ref>

===Scholarship on the Founders===
Articles and books by twenty-first century historians combined with the digitization of primary sources like handwritten letters continue to contribute to an encyclopedic body of knowledge about the Founding Fathers.

====Historians who focus on the Founding Fathers====
'''[[Ron Chernow]]''' won the [[Pulitzer Prize]] for his biography of George Washington. His bestselling book about Alexander Hamilton inspired the blockbuster [[Hamilton (musical)|musical of the same name]].

'''[[Joseph J. Ellis]]''' – According to Ellis, the concept of the Founding Fathers of the U.S. emerged in the 1820s as the last survivors died out. Ellis says "the founders", or "the fathers", comprised an aggregate of semi-sacred figures whose particular accomplishments and singular achievements were decidedly less important than their sheer presence as a powerful but faceless symbol of past greatness. For the generation of national leaders coming of age in the 1820s and 1830s – men like [[Andrew Jackson]], [[Henry Clay]], [[Daniel Webster]], and [[John C. Calhoun]] – "the founders" represented a heroic but anonymous abstraction whose long shadow fell across all followers and whose legendary accomplishments defied comparison.

<blockquote>We can win no laurels in a war for independence," Webster acknowledged in 1825. "Earlier and worthier hands have gathered them all. Nor are there places for us&nbsp;... [as] the founders of states. Our fathers have filled them. But there remains to us a great duty of defence and preservation.<ref>Joseph J. Ellis; ''Passionate Sage: The Character and Legacy of John Adams.'' (2001) p. 214.</ref></blockquote>

'''[[Joanne B. Freeman]]''' – Freeman's area of expertise is the life and legacy of Alexander Hamilton as well as political culture of the revolutionary and early national eras.<ref>{{cite web|publisher=The New York Times|author=Jennifer Schuessler|title=''Up From the Family Basement, a Little-Seen Hamilton Trove''|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/09/arts/design/alexander-hamilton-documents-sothebys.html}}</ref><ref>{{cite-web|publisher=The New York Times|author=Joanne B. Freeman|title=''The Long History of Political Idiocy''|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/04/opinion/the-long-history-of-political-idiocy.html}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|publisher=Slate|author=Joanne B.

'''[[Annette Gordon-Reed]]''' is an American historian and [[Harvard Law School]] professor. She is noted for changing scholarship on [[Thomas Jefferson]] regarding his relationship with [[Sally Hemings]] and her children. She has studied the challenges facing the Founding Fathers particularly as it relates to their position and actions on slavery. She points out "the central dilemma at the heart of American democracy: the desire to create a society based on liberty and equality" that yet does not extend those privileges to all."<ref name="Annette Gordon-Reed 2000 pp. 171-182"/>

'''[[Jack N. Rakove]]''' – Thomas Jefferson

'''[[Peter S. Onuf]]''' – Thomas Jefferson

====Noted collections of the Founding Fathers====
* [[Adams Papers Editorial Project]]

* [[The Papers of Alexander Hamilton]]
* [[The Selected Papers of John Jay]] at Columbia University
* [[The Papers of Thomas Jefferson]] at Princeton University

===In stage and film===
The Founding Fathers were portrayed in the [[Tony Award]] winning musical [[1776 (musical)|''1776'']], a stage production about the debates over, and eventual adoption of, the [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]]; the popular performance was later turned into the [[1776 (film)|1972 film]]

More recently, several of the Founding Fathers – Hamilton, Washington, Jefferson, Madison, Laurens and Burr – were reimagined in [[Hamilton (musical)|''Hamilton'']], an acclaimed production about the life of  [[Alexander Hamilton]], with music, lyrics and book by [[Lin-Manuel Miranda]].The show was inspired by the 2004 biography [[Ron Chernow#Alexander Hamilton|''Alexander Hamilton'']] by historian [[Ron Chernow]]. The rap musical won 11 Tony Awards and a [[Pulitzer Prize for Drama]].<ref>{{cite web|publisher=Playbill|author=Robert Viagas|title=Hamilton Tops Tony Awards With 11 Wins|access-date=April 9, 2017|url=http://www.playbill.com/article/tony-time-its-broadways-biggest-night}}</ref>

===Children's books===
In their 2015 children's book, ''The Founding Fathers'' author Jonah Winter and illustrator [[Barry Blitt]] categorized 14 leading patriots into two teams based on their contributions to the formation of America - the Varsity Squad (Washington, Franklin, Jefferson, John Adams, Madison, Jay, and Hamilton) and the Junior Varsity Squad (Sam Adams, Hancock, Henry, Morris, Marshall, Rush, and Paine).<ref>Winter, Jonah and Blitt, Barry, ''The Founding Fathers!Those Horse-Ridin', Fiddle-Playin', Book-Readin', Gun-Totin' Gentlemen Who Started America'' Simon and Schuster, New York (2015)</ref>
