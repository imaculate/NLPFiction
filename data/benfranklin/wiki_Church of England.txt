The English church renounced [[papal]] authority when [[Henry VIII of England|Henry&nbsp;VIII]] failed to secure an [[annulment]] of his marriage to [[Catherine of Aragon]] in 1534.<ref name="KH8-RC-00"/> The [[English Reformation]] accelerated under [[Edward VI of England|Edward&nbsp;VI]]'s regents, before a brief [[Second Statute of Repeal|restoration of papal authority]] under [[Mary I of England|Queen Mary I]] and [[Philip II of Spain|King Philip]]. The [[Act of Supremacy 1558]] renewed the breach and the [[Elizabethan Settlement]] charted a course enabling the English church to describe itself as both catholic and reformed:
* ''catholic'' in that it views itself as a part of the universal church of [[Jesus Christ]] in unbroken continuity with the early [[Apostolic Age|apostolic]] church. This is expressed in its emphasis on the teachings of the early [[Church Fathers]], as formalised in the [[Apostles' Creed|Apostles']], [[Nicene Creed|Nicene]], and [[Athanasian Creed|Athanasian]] creeds.<ref name="cofeCanons">{{Citation|title=Canons of the Church of England|url=https://www.churchofengland.org/more/policy-and-thinking/canons-church-england/section-a#b5| edition = 7| chapter =Section A: The Church of England| chapter-url = https://www.churchofengland.org/more/policy-and-thinking/canons-church-england/section-a |publisher=Church of England|accessdate=1 February 2018}}</ref> 
* ''reformed'' in that it has been shaped by some of the doctrinal principles of the 16th-century [[Protestant Reformation]], in particular in the [[Thirty-Nine Articles of Religion]] and the [[Book of Common Prayer]].<ref name="cofeCanons"/>

In the earlier phase of the [[English Reformation]] there were both [[List of Catholic martyrs of the English Reformation|Catholic martyrs]] and [[List of Protestant martyrs of the English Reformation|radical Protestant]] martyrs. The later phases saw the [[English Penal Laws|Penal Laws]] punish Roman Catholic and [[Nonconformist|nonconforming Protestants]]. In the 17th century, the [[Puritan]] and [[Presbyterian]] factions continued to challenge the leadership of the Church which under the Stuarts veered towards a more catholic interpretation of the Elizabethan Settlement especially under Archbishop Laud and the rise of the concept of Anglicanism as the [[via media]]. After the victory of the Parliamentarians the Prayer Book was abolished and the Presbyterian and Independent factions dominated. The Episcopacy was abolished. The [[Restoration (1660)|Restoration]] restored the Church of England, episcopacy and the Prayer Book. Papal recognition of [[George III of England|George&nbsp;III]] in 1766 led to greater religious tolerance.

Since the English Reformation, the Church of England has used a [[liturgy]] in English. The church contains several doctrinal strands, the main three known as [[Anglo-Catholic]], [[Evangelical Anglicanism|Evangelical]] and [[Broad Church]]. Tensions between theological conservatives and progressives find expression in debates over the [[Ordination of women in the Anglican Communion|ordination of women]] and [[Homosexuality and Anglicanism|homosexuality]]. The church includes both [[Liberal Christianity|liberal]] and [[British Conservative Evangelicalism|conservative]] clergy and members.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jul/13/church-of-england-power-shifts-laity-liberalism|title=Liberalism increases as power shifts to the laity in the Church of England|last=Brown|first=Andrew|date=13 July 2014|newspaper=The Guardian|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077|access-date=1 May 2016}}</ref>

The governing structure of the church is based on [[diocese]]s, each presided over by a bishop. Within each diocese are local parishes. The [[General Synod of the Church of England]] is the legislative body for the church and comprises bishops, other clergy and [[laity]]. Its measures must be approved by both [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Houses of Parliament]].

===Early Christianity in England===
{{Main|History of Christianity in England|Anglo-Saxon Christianity}}
According to tradition, Christianity arrived in Britain in the [[Christianity in the 1st century|1st]] or [[Christianity in the 2nd century|2nd century]], during which time southern Britain became part of the [[Roman Empire]]. The earliest historical evidence of Christianity among the native [[Britons (historical)|Britons]] is found in the writings of such early Christian Fathers as [[Tertullian]] and [[Origen]] in the first years of the [[Christianity in the 3rd century|3rd century]]. Three [[Romano-British]] bishops, including [[Restitutus]], are known to have been present at the [[Council of Arles (314)|Council of Arles in 314]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Rahner|first=Karl|title=Encyclopedia of theology: a concise Sacramentum mundi|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WtnR-6_PlJAC&pg=PA301|year=1975|publisher=Herder|location=Freiburg|isbn=978-0-86012-006-3|pages=301–302}}</ref> Others attended the [[Council of Serdica]] in 347 and that of [[Council of Ariminum|Ariminum]] in 360, and a number of references to the church in [[Roman Britain]] are found in the writings of [[Christianity in the 4th century|4th century]] Christian fathers. Britain was the home of [[Pelagius]], who opposed [[Augustine of Hippo]]'s doctrine of [[original sin]].<ref>Paula K. Byers; 1998, ''Encyclopedia of World Biography'', Page 189 – Pelagius, {{ISBN|0-7876-2553-1}}</ref>

While Christianity was long established as the religion of the Britons at the time of the [[Anglo-Saxon invasion of Britain|Anglo-Saxon invasion]], Christian Britons made little progress in converting the newcomers from their [[Anglo-Saxon paganism|native paganism]]. Consequently, in 597, [[Pope Gregory I]] sent the [[prior]] of the [[San Gregorio Magno al Celio|Abbey of St Andrew's]] (later canonised as [[Augustine of Canterbury]]) from Rome to evangelise the [[Angles]]. This event is known as the [[Gregorian mission]] and is the date the Church of England generally marks as the beginning of its formal history. With the help of Christians already residing in [[Kingdom of Kent|Kent]], Augustine established his church at [[Canterbury]], the capital of the [[Kingdom of Kent]], and became the first in the series of [[Archbishops of Canterbury]] in 598. A later archbishop, the Greek [[Theodore of Tarsus]], also contributed to the organisation of Christianity in England. The Church of England has been in continuous existence since the days of St Augustine, with the Archbishop of Canterbury as its episcopal head. Despite the various disruptions of the Reformation and the [[English Civil War]], the Church of England considers itself to be the same church which was more formally organised by Augustine.<ref name='DetailedHistory'>{{cite web |url=https://www.churchofengland.org/about-us/history/detailed-history.aspx |title=An Ancient Church - Detailed History |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |date=2016 |website= |publisher=Church of England |access-date=24 October 2016 |quote=}}</ref>

While some Celtic Christian practices were changed at the [[Synod of Whitby]], the Christian in the British Isles was under papal authority from earliest times.<ref>Marcus Holden and Andrew Pinsent, ''The Catholic Gift to Civilisation'' (London: CTS), p. 13ff</ref>  Queen [[Bertha of Kent]] was among the Christians in England who recognised papal authority before Augustine arrived,<ref>D. Attwater, "Ethelbert of Kent" in ''The Penguin Dictionary of Saints'' (Harmondsworth: Penguin Books), p.118</ref> and Celtic Christians were carrying out missionary work with papal approval long before the Synod of Whitby.

[[File:Hereford Cathedral Interior May 2004.jpg|right|thumb|[[Hereford Cathedral|Hereford]] is one of the church's 43 cathedrals; many have histories stretching back centuries]]
The Synod of Whitby established the Roman date for Easter and the Roman style of monastic tonsure in England. This meeting of the ecclesiastics with Roman customs with local bishops was summoned in 664 at Saint Hilda's double monastery of Streonshalh (Streanæshalch), later called [[Whitby Abbey]]. It was presided over by [[Oswiu|King Oswiu]], who did not engage in the debate but made the final ruling.

===Separation from Rome===
In 1534, [[Henry VIII of England|King Henry VIII]] separated the English Church from Rome.<ref name="KH8-RC-00">[http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/british/tudors/english_reformation_01.shtml The English Reformation by Professor Andrew Pettegree]. Bbc.co.uk.</ref> A theological separation had been foreshadowed by various movements within the English Church, such as [[Lollardy]], but the English Reformation gained political support when Henry VIII wanted an [[annulment]] of his marriage to [[Catherine of Aragon]] so he could marry [[Anne Boleyn]]. [[Pope Clement VII]], considering that the earlier marriage had been entered under a [[Dispensation (canon law)|papal dispensation]] and how Catherine's nephew, [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Charles V]], might react to such a move, refused the annulment. Eventually, Henry, although theologically opposed to Protestantism, took the position of [[Supreme Governor of the Church of England|Supreme Head of the Church of England]] to ensure the annulment of his marriage. He was [[excommunicated]] by [[Pope Paul III]].<ref>[http://www.historymole.com/cgi-bin/main/results.pl?theme=10026153 King Henry VIII (1491–1547)]. HistoryMole (18 September 2010).</ref>

In 1536–40 Henry VIII engaged in the [[Dissolution of the Monasteries]], which controlled much of the richest land. He disbanded [[monastery|monasteries]], [[priory|priories]], [[convent]]s and [[friary|friaries]] in England, Wales and Ireland, appropriated their income, disposed of their assets, and provided pensions for the former residents. The properties were sold to pay for the wars.  Bernard argues:
:The dissolution of the monasteries in the late 1530s was one of the most revolutionary events in English history. There were nearly 900 religious houses in England, around 260 for monks, 300 for regular canons, 142 nunneries and 183 friaries; some 12,000 people in total, 4,000 monks, 3,000 canons, 3,000 friars and 2,000 nuns....one adult man in fifty was in religious orders.<ref>G. W. Bernard, "The Dissolution of the Monasteries," ''History'' (2011) 96#324 p 390</ref>

The population of England at the time is estimated to have been only 2.5 million: half male of whom 750,000 adult. This is one in 75, not 1 in 50. However the latter figure is creditable if secular clergy are included.

Henry maintained a strong preference for traditional Catholic practices and, during his reign, Protestant reformers were unable to make many changes to the practices of the Church of England. Indeed, this part of Henry's reign saw trials for heresy of Protestants as well as Roman Catholics.

Under his son, [[Edward VI of England|King Edward VI]], more Protestant-influenced forms of worship were adopted. Under the leadership of the Archbishop of Canterbury, [[Thomas Cranmer]], a more radical reformation proceeded. A new pattern of worship was set out in the [[Book of Common Prayer]] (1549 and 1552). These were based on the older liturgy in particular the Prayer Book of 1549, but both influenced by Protestant doctrines such as justification by faith alone, the rejection of the sacrifice of the Mass, and the Real Presence understood as physical presence (Cranmer was Calvinist in that he believed Christ was truly and really present in the Eucharist but after a spiritual manner, although the Words of Administration at the time of Communion were a straightforward statement in the Real Presence as taken from the 1549 BCP and attached to the 1559 book). The confession of the reformed Church of England was set out in the [[Forty-two Articles]] (later revised to thirty-nine). The reformation however was cut short by the death of the king. [[Mary I of England|Queen Mary I]], who succeeded him, returned England again to the authority of the papacy, thereby ending the first attempt at an independent Church of England. During her co-reign with her husband, [[Philip II of Spain|King Philip]], many leaders and common people were burnt for their refusal to recant of their reformed faith. These are known as the [[Marian martyrs]] and the persecution led to her nickname of "Bloody Mary".

[[File:Rochester cathedral stained glass 2.jpg|left|thumb|Stained glass window in [[Rochester Cathedral]], Kent]]
Mary also died childless and so it was left to the new regime of her half-sister Elizabeth to resolve the direction of the church. The settlement under [[Elizabeth I of England|Queen Elizabeth I]] (from 1558), known as the [[Elizabethan Settlement]], tried to find a middle way between radical Protestantism and Roman Catholicism, the ''via media'' (a term that actually only became current in the 1620s), as the character of the Church of England, a church moderately Reformed in doctrine, as expressed in the [[Thirty-Nine Articles]], but also emphasising continuity with the Catholic and Apostolic traditions of the [[Church Fathers]]. Kneeling reverently to receive communion was the custom. The three-fold ministry in the  Apostolic Succession was maintained; the institutional continuity of the Church was preserved without break (at her accession almost all clergy had been ordained in Catholic Orders using the Roman Pontifical) by consecration of bishops in Catholics Orders, although the character of the organization was changed by the adoption of some reformed doctrines, the simplification of the outwards forms of worship and the abandonment of traditional vestments and art work; the retention of medieval Canon Law, liturgical music and a much shortened Calendar of Saints and Feast Days. It was a most peculiar situation: the same organization but with a modified face to the world without much particular character of its own until the notion of Anglicanism as a distinct variety of Christianity emerged very late in her reign and during the reigns of the early Stuart Kings.  It was also an [[established church]] (constitutionally established by the state with the Head of State as its [[Supreme Governor of the Church of England|supreme governor]]).  The exact nature of the relationship between church and state would be a source of continued friction into the next century.

===Stuart period===
{{further|Stuart period}}
For the next century, through the reigns of [[James VI and I|James I]], who ordered the translation of the Bible known as the King James Version (authorized to be used in parishes which does not mean it was the official version),<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=tC1kuaetNqoC&dq=The+Diary+Of+Samuel+Ward,+A+Translator+Of+The+1611+King+James+Bible%E2%80%8E The Diary Of Samuel Ward: A Translator Of The 1611 King James Bible], edited by [[John Wilson Cowart]] and M. M. Knappen</ref> and [[Charles I of England|Charles I]], culminating in the [[English Civil War]] and the Protectorate of [[Oliver Cromwell]], there were significant swings back and forth between two factions: the [[Puritans]] (and other radicals) who sought more far-reaching Protestant reforms, and the more conservative churchmen who aimed to keep closer to traditional beliefs and Catholic practices. The failure of political and ecclesiastical authorities to submit to Puritan demands for more extensive reform was one of the causes of open warfare. By Continental standards the level of violence over religion was not high, since the Civil War was mainly about politics, but the casualties included King Charles I and the Archbishop of Canterbury, [[William Laud]] and tens of thousands of civilians who died from the unsettled conditions. Under the Commonwealth and the Protectorate of England from 1649 to 1660, the bishops were dethroned and former practices were outlawed, and [[Presbyterian polity|Presbyterian]] ecclesiology was introduced in place of the episcopate. The 39 Articles were replaced by the [[Westminster Confession]], the Book of Common Prayer by the Directory of Public Worship. Despite this, about one quarter of English clergy refused to conform to this form of State Presbyterianism.

[[File:CANTEBURY ALTAR HORIZONTAL 7424.jpg|thumb|Major repairs were done to Canterbury Cathedral after the Restoration in 1660]]

With the Restoration of Charles II, Parliament restored the Church of England to a form not far removed from the Elizabethan version. One difference was that the ideal of encompassing all the people of England in one religious organisation, taken for granted by the Tudors, had to be abandoned. The religious landscape of England assumed its present form, with the Anglican established church occupying the middle ground, and those Puritans and Protestants who [[English Dissenters|dissented]] from the Anglican establishment having to continue their existence outside the national church rather than trying to influence or trying to gain control of it. One result of the Restoration was the ousting of 2,000 parish ministers who had not been ordained by bishops in the Apostolic Succession or who had been ordained by ministers in presbyter's orders. Official suspicion and legal restrictions continued well into the 19th century. Roman Catholics, perhaps 5% of the English population (down from 20% in 1600) were grudgingly tolerated, having had little or no official representation after the Pope's excommunication of Queen Elizabeth in 1570, though the Stuarts were sympathetic to them. By the end of 18th century they had dwindled to 1% of the population mostly among eccentric upper middle-class gentry and their tenants and extended families.

===19th century===
By the Fifth Article of the [[Acts of Union 1800|Union with Ireland 1800]], the Church of England and [[Church of Ireland]] were united into "one Protestant Episcopal church, to be called, the United Church of England and Ireland".<ref>''The Laws of England'', p.104</ref>{{full citation needed|date=January 2019}} Although this union was declared "an essential and fundamental Part of the Union",<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.rahbarnes.co.uk/Union/ActOfUnion%28Ireland%29.php | title=An Act for the Union of Great Britain and Ireland 1800 – Article Fifth (sic) | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180324152426/http://www.rahbarnes.co.uk/Union/ActOfUnion(Ireland).php | archivedate=March 24, 2018}}</ref> the [[Irish Church Act 1869]] separated the Irish part of the church again and disestablished it, the Act coming into effect on 1 January 1871.

===Overseas developments===

{{main|Anglican Communion}}
{{further|Historical development of Church of England dioceses#Colonial dioceses}}
As the [[British Empire]] expanded, British colonists and colonial administrators took the established church doctrines and practices together with ordained ministry and formed overseas branches of the Church of England. As they developed or, beginning with the United States of America, became sovereign or independent states, many of their churches became separate organisationally but remained linked to the Church of England through the [[Anglican Communion]].

In Bermuda, the oldest remaining English colony (now designated a [[British Overseas Territory]]), the first Church of England services were performed by the Reverend Richard Buck, one of the survivors of the 1609 wreck of the ''[[Sea Venture]]'' which initiated Bermuda's permanent settlement. The nine parishes of the Church of England in [[Bermuda]], each with its own church and [[Glebe|glebe land]], rarely had more than a pair of ordained ministers to share between them until the Nineteenth Century. From 1825 to 1839, Bermuda's parishes were attached to the [[Diocese of Nova Scotia and Prince Edward Island|See of Nova Scotia]]. Bermuda was then grouped into the new Diocese of Newfoundland and Bermuda from 1839. In 1879, the Synod of the Church of England in Bermuda was formed. At the same time, a Diocese of Bermuda became separate from the [[Diocese of Newfoundland]], but both continued to be grouped under the ''Bishop of Newfoundland and Bermuda'' until 1919, when Newfoundland and Bermuda each received its own Bishop.

The Church of England in Bermuda was renamed in 1978 as the [[Anglican Church of Bermuda]], which is an [[Extra-provincial Anglican churches|extra-provincial diocese]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.anglicancommunion.org/tour/index.cfm|title=Member Churches|first=Anglican Communion|last=Office|publisher=}}</ref> with both [[Metropolitan bishop|metropolitan]] and [[Primate (bishop)|primatial]] authority coming directly from the Archbishop of Canterbury. Among its parish churches is [[St. Peter's Church, St. George's|St Peter's Church]] in the [[UNESCO World Heritage Site]] of [[St. George's, Bermuda|St George's Town]], which is both the oldest Anglican and the oldest non-Roman Catholic church in the New World.

===21st century===

====Deposition from holy orders overturned====

Under the guidance of [[Rowan Williams]] and with significant pressure from clergy union representatives, the ecclesiastical penalty for convicted felons to be defrocked was set aside from the [[List of Church of England Measures|Clergy Discipline Measure 2003]].  The clergy union argued that the penalty was unfair to victims of hypothetical miscarriages of criminal justice, because the ecclesiastical penalty is considered irreversible. Although clerics can still be banned for life from ministry, they remain ordained as priests.<ref>[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/religion/11735289/Church-of-England-could-return-to-defrocking-rogue-priests-after-child-abuse-scandals.html telegraph.co.uk: "Church of England could return to defrocking rogue priests after child abuse scandals"], 13 July 2015</ref>

====Dwindling congregations====
[[File:Holy trinity front 8809.jpg|thumb|One of the now "redundant" buildings, [[Holy Trinity Church, Wensley]], in North Yorkshire; much of the current structure was built in the 14th and 15th Centuries]]

The archbishops of [[Justin Welby|Canterbury]] and [[John Sentamu|York]] warned in January 2015 that the Church of England will no longer be able to carry on in its current form unless the downward spiral in membership is somehow reversed as typical Sunday attendances had halved to 800,000 in the previous 40 years:<ref>[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/religion/11340590/Church-of-England-cannot-carry-on-as-it-is-unless-decline-urgently-reversed-Welby-and-Sentamu.html "Church of England cannot carry on as it is unless decline 'urgently' reversed – Welby and Sentamu"], ''The Daily Telegraph'', 12 January 2015.</ref>
{{quote|The urgency of the challenge facing us is not in doubt.  Attendance at Church of England services has declined at an average of one per cent per annum over recent decades and, in addition, the age profile of our membership has become significantly older than that of the population... Renewing and reforming aspects of our institutional life is a necessary but far from sufficient response to the challenges facing the Church of England... The age profile of our clergy has also been increasing. Around 40 per cent of parish clergy are due to retire over the next decade or so.}}

However, [[Sarah Mullally]], the fourth woman chosen to become a bishop in the Church of England, insisted in June 2015 that declining numbers at services should not necessarily be a cause of despair for churches because people will still "encounter God" without ever taking their place in a pew, saying that people might hear the Christian message through social media sites such as Facebook or in a café run as a community project.<ref>[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/religion/11663692/Empty-pews-not-the-end-of-the-world-says-Church-of-Englands-newest-bishop.html "Empty pews not the end of the world, says Church of England's newest bishop"], ''The Daily Telegraph'', 9 June 2015.</ref> Additionally, the church's own statistics reveal that 9.7 million people visit at least one of its churches every year and 1 million students are educated at Church of England schools (which number 4,700).<ref>{{cite web|title=Facts and Stats of The Church of England|url=https://www.churchofengland.org/about-us/facts-stats.aspx|website=churchofengland.org|publisher=Church of England|accessdate=8 April 2016}}</ref>

Approximately 30 Church of England parish churches are declared "closed for regular public worship" (previously termed "redundant") each year.<ref>[http://www.cofe.anglican.org/about/churchcommissioners/pastoralandclosedchurches/closedchurches/ Closed Churches Division]</ref> Between 1969 and 2010, a full 1795 closures were achieved, equalling roughly 11% of the stock, with just over a third being [[Listed buildings]], either Grade I or II. Of these, closures, only 514 were made since 1990. Some active use is made of about half of the closed churches.<ref>http://www.theheritagealliance.org.uk/hrba/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/churches-and-closure-in-cofe-mar-2010.pdf, p=2</ref>

====Low salaries====
In 2015 the Church of England admitted that it was embarrassed to be paying staff under the living wage. The Church of England had previously campaigned for all employers to pay this minimum amount. The archbishop of Canterbury acknowledged it was not the only area where the church "fell short of its standards".<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-31591075|title=Church of England: Justin Welby says low pay 'embarrassing'|work=BBC News}}</ref>

The [[canon law]] of the Church of England identifies the [[Bible|Christian scriptures]] as the source of its doctrine. In addition, doctrine is also derived from the teachings of the [[Church Fathers]] and [[ecumenical councils]] (as well as the [[ecumenical creeds]]) in so far as these agree with scripture. This doctrine is expressed in the [[Thirty-Nine Articles of Religion]], the [[Book of Common Prayer]], and the Ordinal containing the rites for the ordination of [[deacon#Anglicanism|deacons]], [[Anglican priest|priests]], and the consecration of bishops.<ref name=CanonA5>Canon A5. [http://www.cofe.anglican.org/about/churchlawlegis/canons/church.pdf Canons of the Church of England].</ref> Unlike other traditions, the Church of England has no single theologian that it can look to as a founder. However, [[Richard Hooker]]'s appeal to scripture, [[Christian tradition|church tradition]], and [[reason]] as sources of authority continue to inform Anglican identity.<ref name="EncRelg349-350">Massey H. Shepherd, Jr. and Dale B. Martin, "Anglicanism" in ''Encyclopedia of Religion'', vol. 1, 2nd. ed., edited by Lindsay Jones (Detroit:Macmillan Reference USA, 2005), pp. 349–350.</ref>

[[File:Canterbury Cathedral - Portal Nave Cross-spire.jpeg|thumb|left|[[Canterbury Cathedral]] houses the ''[[cathedra]]'' or episcopal chair of the [[Archbishop of Canterbury]] and is the cathedral of the [[Diocese of Canterbury]] and the [[mother church]] of the Church of England as well as a focus for the [[Anglican Communion]]]]
The Church of England's doctrinal character today is largely the result of the Elizabethan Settlement, which sought to establish a comprehensive middle way between Roman Catholicism and Protestantism. The Church of England affirms the Protestant Reformation principle that scripture contains all things necessary to salvation and is the final arbiter in doctrinal matters. The Thirty-nine Articles are the church's only official confessional statement. Though not a complete system of doctrine, the articles highlight areas of agreement with [[Lutheran]] and [[Calvinism|Reformed]] positions, while differentiating Anglicanism from Roman Catholicism and [[Anabaptism]].<ref name="EncRelg349-350"/>

While embracing some themes of the Protestant Reformation, the Church of England also maintains Catholic traditions of the ancient church and teachings of the Church Fathers, unless these are considered contrary to scripture. It accepts the decisions of the first four ecumenical councils concerning the [[Trinity]] and the [[Incarnation (Christianity)|Incarnation]]. The Church of England also preserves Catholic Order by adhering to [[episcopal polity]], with ordained orders of bishops, priests and deacons. There are differences of opinion within the Church of England over the necessity of episcopacy. Some consider it essential, while others feel it is needed for the proper ordering of the church.<ref name="EncRelg349-350"/> In sum these express the 'Via Media' viewpoint that the first five centuries of doctrinal development and church order as approved as acceptable be a kind of yardstick by which to gauge authentic catholicity, as minimum and sufficient; Anglicanism did not emerge as the result of charismatic leaders with particular doctrines. It is light on details compared to Roman Catholic, Reformed and Lutheran teachings. The Bible, the Creeds, Apostolic Order, and the administration of the Sacraments are sufficient to establish Catholicity. Indeed, not one major doctrinal development emerged from the English reformation, per Diarmid MacCulloch, The Later Reformation in England, 1990, p.&nbsp;55. The Reformation in England was initially much concerned about doctrine but the Elizabethan Settlement tried to put a stop to doctrinal contentions. The proponents of further changes, nonetheless, tried to get their way by making changes in Church Order (abolition of bishops), governance (Canon Law) and liturgy ('too Catholic'). They did not succeed because the Monarchy, the Church and resisted and the majority of the population were indifferent. Moreover, "despite all the assumptions of the Reformation founders of that Church, it had retained a catholic character." The Elizabethan Settlement had created a cuckoo in a nest..." a Protestant theology and program within a largely pre-Reformation Catholic structure whose continuing life would arouse a theological interest in the Catholicism that had created it; and would result in the rejection of predestinarian theology in favor of sacraments, especially the eucharist, ceremonial, and anti-Calvinist doctrine" (ibid pp.&nbsp;78–86). The existence of cathedrals "without substantial alteration" and  "where the "old devotional world cast its longest shadow for the future of the ethos that would become Anglicanism," p.&nbsp;79. This is "One of the great mysteries of the English Reformation," ibid that there was no complete break with the past but a muddle that was per force turned into a virtue. The story of the English Reformation is the tale of retreat from the Protestant advance of 1550 which could not proceed further in the face of the opposition of the institution which was rooted in the medieval past, ibid. p.&nbsp;142 and the adamant opposition of Queen Elizabeth I.

The Church of England has, as one of its distinguishing marks, a breadth and "open-mindedness". This tolerance has allowed Anglicans who emphasise the Catholic tradition and others who emphasise the Reformed tradition to coexist. The three "parties" (see [[Churchmanship]]) in the Church of England are sometimes called [[high church]] (or [[Anglo-Catholic]]), [[low church]] (or [[evangelical Anglican]]) and [[broad church]] (or [[Liberal Christianity|liberal]]). The high church party places importance on the Church of England's continuity with the pre-Reformation Catholic Church, adherence to ancient liturgical usages and the sacerdotal nature of the priesthood. As their name suggests, Anglo-Catholics maintain many traditional Catholic practices and liturgical forms.<ref name=HighChurch>"High Church", ''New Catholic Encyclopedia'', 2nd ed., vol. 6 (Detroit: Gale, 2003), pp. 823–824.</ref> The low church party is more Protestant in both ceremony and theology.<ref name=LowChurch>"Low Church", ''New Catholic Encyclopedia'', 2nd ed., vol. 8 (Detroit: Gale, 2003), p. 836.</ref> Historically, broad church has been used to describe those of middle-of-the-road ceremonial preferences who lean theologically towards liberal Protestantism.<ref name=BroadChurch>E. McDermott, "Broad Church", ''New Catholic Encyclopedia'', 2nd ed., vol. 2 (Detroit: Gale, 2003), pp. 624–625.</ref>  The balance between these strands of churchmanship is not static: in 2013, 40% of Church of England worshippers attended evangelical churches (compared with 26% in 1989), and 83% of very large congregations were evangelical. Such churches were also reported to attract higher numbers of men and young adults than others.<ref>'New Directions', May 2013</ref>

===Worship and liturgy===
The Church of England's official book of liturgy as established in English Law is the ''[[Book of Common Prayer]]'' (BCP). In addition to this book the General Synod has also legislated for a modern [[liturgical book]], ''[[Common Worship]]'', dating from 2000, which can be used as an alternative to the BCP. Like its predecessor, the 1980 ''[[Alternative Service Book]]'', it differs from the ''Book of Common Prayer'' in providing a range of alternative services, mostly in modern language, although it does include some BCP-based forms as well, for example Order Two for Holy Communion. (This is a revision of the BCP service, altering some words and allowing the insertion of some other liturgical texts such as the ''[[Agnus Dei (liturgy)|Agnus Dei]]'' before communion.) The Order One rite follows the pattern of more modern liturgical scholarship.

The liturgies are organised according to the traditional [[liturgical year]] and the [[Calendar of saints (Church of England)|calendar of saints]]. The [[Anglican sacraments|sacraments]] of [[baptism]] and the [[Eucharist]] are generally thought necessary to salvation. [[Infant baptism]] is practised. At a later age, individuals baptised as infants receive [[confirmation]] by a bishop, at which time they reaffirm the baptismal promises made by their parents or sponsors. The Eucharist, consecrated by a thanksgiving prayer including Christ's [[Words of Institution]], is believed to be "a memorial of Christ's once-for-all redemptive acts in which Christ is objectively present and effectually received in faith".<ref name=EncRelg350>Shepherd, Jr. and Martin, "Anglicanism", p. 350.</ref>

The use of hymns and [[Anglican church music|music in the Church of England]] has changed dramatically over the centuries. Traditional [[Evening Prayer (Anglican)|Choral evensong]] is a staple of most cathedrals.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}} The style of [[psalm]] chanting harks back to the Church of England's pre-reformation roots. During the 18th century, clergy such as [[Charles Wesley]] introduced their own styles of worship with poetic hymns.

In the latter half of the 20th century, the influence of the [[Charismatic Movement]] significantly altered the worship traditions of numerous Church of England parishes, primarily affecting those of [[evangelical]] persuasion. These churches now adopt a [[contemporary worship]] form of service, with minimal liturgical or ritual elements, and incorporating [[contemporary worship music]].

=== Women's ministry ===
Women were appointed as deaconesses from 1861 but they could not function fully as deacons and were not considered ordained clergy. Women have been [[lay reader]]s for a long time. During the First World War, some women were appointed as lay readers, known as "[[bishop's messenger]]s", who also led missions and ran churches in the absence of men. After that no more lay readers were appointed until 1969.

Legislation authorising the ordination of women as deacons was passed in 1986 and they were first ordained in 1987. The [[ordination of women]] as priests was passed by the [[General Synod of the Church of England|General Synod]] in 1992 and [[List of the first 32 women ordained as Church of England priests|began in 1994]]. In 2010, for the first time in the history of the Church of England, more women than men were ordained as priests (290 women and 273 men).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/religion/9060296/More-new-women-priests-than-men-for-first-time.html|title=More new women priests than men for first time|work=The Daily Telegraph |date=4 February 2012 |accessdate=11 July 2012}}</ref>

In July 2005, the synod voted to "set in train" the process of allowing the consecration of women as bishops. In February 2006, the synod voted overwhelmingly for the "further exploration" of possible arrangements for parishes that did not want to be directly under the authority of a bishop who is a woman.<ref>[http://www.ekklesia.co.uk/content/news_syndication/article_060210women.shtml Church votes overwhelmingly for compromise on women bishops – news from].

=== Liberal theology ===
{{See also|Liberal Christianity}}Just as the Church of England has a large conservative or "traditionalist" wing, it also has many [[Liberal Christianity|liberal]] members and clergy. Approximately one third of clergy "doubt or disbelieve in the physical resurrection".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1403106/One-third-of-clergy-do-not-believe-in-the-Resurrection.html|title=One third of clergy do not believe in the Resurrection|last=Correspondent|first=By Jonathan Petre, Religion|website=Telegraph.co.uk|access-date=1 May 2016}}</ref> Others, such as the Revd [[Giles Fraser]], a contributor to ''The Guardian'', have argued for an allegorical interpretation of the [[virgin birth of Jesus]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/dec/24/story-virgin-birth-christianity-mary-sex-femininity|title=The story of the virgin birth runs against the grain of Christianity|date=24 December 2015|newspaper=The Guardian|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077|access-date=1 May 2016}}</ref> ''The Independent'' reported in 2014 that, according to a YouGov survey of Church of England clergy, "as many as 16 per cent are unclear about God and two per cent think it is no more than a human construct."<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/survey-finds-2-of-anglican-priests-are-not-believers-9821899.html|title=Survey finds 2 per cent of Anglican priests are not believers|date=27 October 2014|website=The Independent|language=en-GB|access-date=1 May 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://cdn.yougov.com/cumulus_uploads/document/5f5s31fk47/Results-for-Anglican-Clergy-Survey-08092014.pdf|title=YouGov / University of Lancaster and Westminster Faith Debates|date=23 October 2014|website=YouGov|language=en-GB|access-date=2 May 2016}}</ref> Moreover, many congregations are seeker-friendly environments.

===Bioethics issues===
The Church of England is generally opposed to abortion but recognises that "there can be - strictly limited - conditions under which it may be morally preferable to any available alternative".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.churchofengland.org/our-views/medical-ethics-health-social-care-policy/abortion.aspx|title=The Church of England's position on abortion|website=www.churchofengland.org|access-date=14 May 2016}}</ref> The church also opposes euthanasia. Its official stance is that "While acknowledging the complexity of the issues involved in assisted dying/suicide and voluntary euthanasia, the Church of England is opposed to any change in the law or in medical practice that would make assisted dying/suicide or voluntary euthanasia permissible in law or acceptable in practice." It also states that "Equally, the Church shares the desire to alleviate physical and psychological suffering, but believes that assisted dying/suicide and voluntary euthanasia are not acceptable means of achieving these laudable goals."<ref>[https://www.churchofengland.org/media/57990/assisteddyingpdfmar09.pdf "Assisted Dying/Suicide and Voluntary Euthanasia"], Church of England official website.</ref> However, George Carey, a former Archbishop of Canterbury, announced that he had changed his stance on euthanasia in 2014 and now advocated legalising "assisted dying".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/society/2014/jul/12/archbishop-canterbury-carey-support-assisted-dying-proposal|title=Former archbishop lends his support to campaign to legalise right to die|last=Watt|first=Nicholas|date=11 July 2014|website=the Guardian|access-date=31 May 2016}}</ref> On embryonic stem-cell research, the church has announced "cautious acceptance to the proposal to produce cytoplasmic hybrid embryos for research".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.churchofengland.org/our-views/medical-ethics-health-social-care-policy/hfea.aspx|title=The Church of England and human fertilisation & embryology|website=www.churchofengland.org|access-date=31 May 2016}}</ref>

==Poverty==

===Church Urban Fund===
{{Main|Church Urban Fund}}
The Church of England set up the [[Church Urban Fund]] in the 1980s to tackle poverty and [[Social deprivation|deprivation]].  They see poverty as trapping individuals and communities with some people in urgent need. This leads to [[Dependant|dependency]], [[homelessness]], [[hunger]], [[social isolation|isolation]], [[low income]], [[mental health]] problems, [[social exclusion]] and violence. They feel that poverty reduces confidence and [[life expectancy]] and that people born in poor conditions have difficulty escaping their disadvantaged circumstances.<ref>[http://www.cuf.org.uk/about About Church Urban Fund] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131214051036/http://www.cuf.org.uk/about |date=14 December 2013 }}</ref>

====Child poverty====
In parts of [[Liverpool]], Manchester and [[Newcastle upon Tyne|Newcastle]] two-thirds of babies are born to poverty and have poorer life chances, also life expectancy 15 years lower than babies born in most fortunate communities. [[South Shore, Blackpool]], has lowest life expectancy at 66 years for men.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-18137739|title=Church Urban Fund finds 'poorest' in north-west England|work=BBC News}}</ref>
{{quote|The deep-rooted unfairness in our society is highlighted by these stark statistics. Children being born in this country, just a few miles apart, couldn't witness a more wildly differing start to life. In child poverty terms, we live in one of the most unequal countries in the western world. We want people to understand where their own community sits alongside neighbouring communities. The disparity is often shocking but it's crucial that, through greater awareness, people from all backgrounds come together to think about what could be done to support those born into poverty.

===Action on hunger===
Many prominent people in the Church of England have spoken out against poverty and welfare cuts in the United Kingdom. Twenty-seven bishops are among 43 Christian leaders who signed a letter which urged [[David Cameron]] to make sure people [[Poverty#Hunger|have enough to eat]].
{{quote|We often hear talk of hard choices. Surely few can be harder than that faced by the tens of thousands of older people who must 'heat or eat' each winter, harder than those faced by families whose wages have stayed flat while food prices have gone up 30% in just five years.  Yet beyond even this we must, as a society, face up to the fact that over half of people using food banks have been put in that situation by cutbacks to and failures in the benefit system, whether it be payment delays or punitive sanctions.<ref name="BBC20/02/14">[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-26261700 Church of England bishops demand action over hunger]</ref>}}

[[Welfare state in the United Kingdom|Benefit]] cuts, failures and "punitive sanctions" force thousands of UK citizens to use [[food bank]]s. The campaign to end hunger considers this "truly shocking" and called for a national day of [[fasting]] on 4 April 2014.<ref name="BBC20/02/14"/>

[[Monarchy of the United Kingdom|The British monarch]] has the constitutional title of [[Supreme Governor of the Church of England]]. The canon law of the Church of England states, "We acknowledge that the Queen's most excellent Majesty, acting according to the laws of the realm, is the highest power under God in this kingdom, and has supreme authority over all persons in all causes, as well ecclesiastical as civil."<ref>Canon A 7 "Of the Royal Supremacy"</ref> In practice this power is often exercised through [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament]] and the [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]].

In addition to England, the jurisdiction of the Church of England extends to the [[Isle of Man]], the [[Channel Islands]] and a few parishes in [[Flintshire]], [[Monmouthshire]], [[Powys]] and [[Radnorshire]] in Wales [[Church of England border polls 1915–1916|which voted to remain with the Church of England rather than joining the Church in Wales]].<ref>Cross, F. L. (ed.) (1957) Oxford Dictionary of the Christian Church; p. 1436</ref> Expatriate congregations on the continent of Europe have become the [[Diocese of Gibraltar in Europe]].

The church is structured as follows (from the lowest level upwards):
[[File:TootBaldon StLawrence ParishChurch.JPG|thumb|right|The parish church of St Lawrence in [[Toot Baldon]] is typical of many small English village churches]]
* [[Parish]] is the most local level, often consisting of one church building and community, although many parishes are joining forces in a variety of ways for financial reasons. The parish is looked after by a parish [[Anglican priest|priest]] who for historical or legal reasons may be called by one of the following offices: [[vicar]], [[Rector (ecclesiastical)|rector]], [[priest in charge]], team rector, team vicar. The first, second, and fourth of these may also be known as the 'incumbent'. The running of the parish is the joint responsibility of the incumbent and the [[Parochial Church Council]] (PCC), which consists of the parish clergy and elected representatives from the congregation. The Diocese of Gibraltar in Europe is not formally divided into parishes.
* There are a number of local churches that do not have a parish. In urban areas there are a number of [[proprietary chapel]]s (mostly built in the 19th century to cope with urbanisation and growth in population). Also in more recent years there are increasingly [[church plant]]s and [[fresh expression]]s of church, whereby new congregations are planted in locations such as schools or pubs to spread the Gospel of Christ in non-traditional ways.
[[File:Diocese of Gibraltar in Europe.PNG|thumb|right|Map showing the Diocese of Gibraltar in Europe with the archdeaconries colour-coded]]
* [[Deanery]], ''e.g.'', Lewisham or Runnymede. This is the area for which a [[Rural Dean]] (or area dean) is responsible. It consists of a number of parishes in a particular district. The rural dean is usually the incumbent of one of the constituent parishes. The parishes each elect lay (non-ordained) representatives to the deanery [[synod]]. Deanery synod members each have a vote in the election of representatives to the diocesan synod.
* Archdeaconry, ''e.g.'', the seven in the [[Diocese of Gibraltar in Europe]]. This is the area under the jurisdiction of an [[archdeacon]]. It consists of a number of deaneries.
* [[Diocese]], ''e.g.'', [[Diocese of Durham]], [[Diocese of Guildford]], [[Diocese of St Albans]]. This is the area under the jurisdiction of a diocesan bishop, ''e.g.'', the Bishops of Durham, Guildford and St Albans, and will have a cathedral. There may be one or more assisting bishops, usually called [[suffragan bishop]]s, within the diocese who assist the diocesan bishop in his ministry, ''e.g.'', in Guildford diocese, the Bishop of Dorking. In some very large dioceses a legal measure has been enacted to create "episcopal areas", where the diocesan bishop runs one such area himself and appoints "area bishops" to run the other areas as mini-dioceses, legally delegating many of his powers to the area bishops. Dioceses with episcopal areas include [[Diocese of London|London]], [[Diocese of Chelmsford|Chelmsford]], [[Diocese of Oxford|Oxford]], [[Diocese of Chichester|Chichester]], [[Anglican Diocese of Southwark|Southwark]], and [[Diocese of Lichfield|Lichfield]]. The bishops work with an elected body of [[Laity|lay]] and [[ordained]] representatives, known as the [[Diocesan Synod]], to run the diocese. A diocese is subdivided into a number of archdeaconries.
* [[Ecclesiastical province|Province]], ''i.e.'', Canterbury or York. This is the area under the jurisdiction of an [[archbishop]], ''i.e.'' the Archbishops of Canterbury and York. Decision-making within the province is the responsibility of the [[General Synod]] (see also above). A province is subdivided into dioceses.
* [[Primacy of Canterbury|Primacy]], ''i.e.'', Church of England. In addition to his specific authority in his own province, each archbishop is "Primate of All England" (Canterbury) or "Primate of England" (York) and has powers that extend over the whole country—for example his licence to marry without the [[banns]] (marriage licence).
* [[Royal Peculiar]], a small number of churches which are more closely associated with [[the Crown]], and, a very few more closely associated with the law, and are outside the usual church hierarchy though conforming to the rite. These are outside episcopal jurisdiction.

All [[Vicar#Anglican|rectors and vicars]] are [[advowson|appointed by patrons]], who may be private individuals, corporate bodies such as cathedrals, colleges or trusts, or by the bishop or directly by the Crown. No clergy can be instituted and inducted into a parish without swearing the Oath of Allegiance to Her Majesty, and taking the Oath of Canonical Obedience "in all things lawful and honest" to the bishop. Usually they are instituted to the benefice by the bishop and then inducted by the archdeacon into the possession of the benefice property—church and parsonage. [[Curate]]s (assistant clergy) are appointed by rectors and vicars, or if priests-in-charge by the bishop after consultation with the patron. Cathedral clergy (normally a [[List of deans in the Church of England|dean]] and a varying number of residentiary canons who constitute the cathedral chapter) are appointed either by the Crown, the bishop, or by the dean and chapter themselves. Clergy officiate in a diocese either because they hold office as beneficed clergy or are licensed by the bishop when appointed, or simply with permission.

===Primates===
[[File:Justin Welby at Seoul Cathedral.jpg|upright=0.8|thumb|right|[[Justin Welby]], [[Archbishop of Canterbury]]]]

The most senior bishop of the Church of England is the [[Archbishop of Canterbury]], who is the [[Metropolitan bishop|metropolitan]] of the southern province of England, the Province of Canterbury. He has the status of [[Primate (bishop)|Primate]] of All England. He is the focus of unity for the worldwide Anglican Communion of independent national or regional churches. [[Justin Welby]] has been Archbishop of Canterbury since the confirmation of his election on 4 February 2013.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-21315054|title=Justin Welby becomes Archbishop of Canterbury|work=BBC News}}</ref>

The second most senior bishop is the [[Archbishop of York]], who is the metropolitan of the northern province of England, the Province of York. For historical reasons (relating to the time of York's control by the [[Danelaw|Danes]]) he is referred to as the Primate of England. [[John Sentamu]] became Archbishop of York in 2005. The Bishop of London, the Bishop of Durham and the Bishop of Winchester are ranked in the next three positions.

===Diocesan bishops===
The process of appointing diocesan bishops is complex, due to historical reasons balancing hierarchy against democracy, and is handled by the [[Appointment of Church of England bishops|Crown Nominations Committee]] which submits names to the Prime Minister (acting on behalf of the Crown) for consideration.

===Representative bodies===
{{Main|General Synod of the Church of England}}
The Church of England has a legislative body, the [[General Synod of the Church of England|General Synod]]. Synod can create two types of legislation, [[List of Church of England Measures|measures]] and [[canon law|canons]]. Measures have to be approved but cannot be amended by the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|British Parliament]] before receiving the [[Royal Assent]] and becoming part of the law of England.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cofe.anglican.org/about/churchlawlegis/measures/|title=Summary of Church Assembly and General Synod Measures|date=November 2007|work=Church of England website|publisher=Archbishops' council of the Church of England}}</ref> Although it is the [[state religion|established]] church in England only, its measures must be approved by both Houses of Parliament including the non-English members. Canons require Royal Licence and Royal Assent, but form the law of the church, rather than the law of the land.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cofe.anglican.org/about/gensynod/|title=General Synod|work=Church of England website|publisher=Archbishops' council of the Church of England|access-date=5 June 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20041112052103/http://www.cofe.anglican.org/about/gensynod/|archive-date=12 November 2004|dead-url=yes}}</ref>

Another assembly is the [[Convocations of Canterbury and York|Convocation of the English Clergy]], which is older than the General Synod and its predecessor the Church Assembly. By the 1969 Synodical Government Measure almost all of the Convocations' functions were transferred to the General Synod. Additionally, there are [[Diocesan Synod]]s and [[Deanery#Anglican usage|deanery synods]], which are the governing bodies of the divisions of the Church.

===House of Lords===
{{Main|Lords Spiritual}}
Of the 42 diocesan [[archbishop]]s and bishops in the Church of England, 26 are permitted to sit in the [[House of Lords]]. The Archbishops of [[Archbishop of Canterbury|Canterbury]] and [[Archbishops of York|York]] automatically have seats, as do the Bishops of [[Bishop of London|London]], [[Bishop of Durham|Durham]] and [[Bishop of Winchester|Winchester]]. The remaining 21 seats are filled in order of seniority by [[consecration]]. It may take a diocesan bishop a number of years to reach the House of Lords, at which point he becomes a [[Lords Spiritual|Lord Spiritual]]. The [[Bishop of Sodor and Man]] and the [[Bishop of Gibraltar in Europe]] are not eligible to sit in the House of Lords as their dioceses lie outside the United Kingdom.<ref>[http://www.parliament.uk/directories/house_of_lords_information_office/alphabetical_list_of_members.cfm House of Lords: alphabetical list of Members] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080702053341/http://www.parliament.uk/directories/house_of_lords_information_office/alphabetical_list_of_members.cfm |date=2 July 2008 }}. Retrieved 12 December 2008.</ref>

===Crown dependencies===
Although they are not part of [[England]] or the [[United Kingdom]], the Church of England is also the [[State religion|Established Church]] in the [[Crown dependencies]] of the [[Isle of Man]], the [[Jersey|Bailiwick of Jersey]] and the [[Bailiwick of Guernsey]]. The [[Isle of Man]] has its own diocese of [[Sodor and Man]], and the [[Bishop of Sodor and Man]] is an ex officio member of the [[Legislative Council of the Isle of Man|Legislative Council]] of the [[Tynwald]] on the island.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Gell|first1=Sir James|title=Gell on Manx Church|url=http://www.isle-of-man.com/manxnotebook/manxsoc/msvol31/gell.htm|website=Isle Of Man Online|publisher=IOM Online|accessdate=7 February 2017}}</ref> The [[Channel Islands]] are part of the [[Diocese of Winchester]], and in [[Jersey]] the [[Dean of Jersey]] is a non-voting member of the [[States of Jersey]]. In [[Guernsey]] the Church of England is the [[State religion|Established Church]], although the [[Dean of Guernsey]] is not a member of the [[States of Guernsey]].<ref>{{cite web|title=About|url=http://www.churchofengland.org.gg/about|website=Guernsey Deanery|publisher=Church of England}}</ref>

==Sex abuse==
{{See also|Anglican Communion sexual abuse cases}}
The Archbishop of Canterbury, [[Justin Welby]], has made some effort to prevent complaints of [[Anglican Church sexual abuse cases|sex abuse cases]] being covered up. Independent investigators are examining files as far back as the 1950s and Welby hopes this independence will prevent any possibility of a [[cover-up]].<ref>[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-22498734 "Inquiry into CofE cleric abuse claim set up"], BBC.</ref> 
{{quote|We will systematically bring those transparently and openly first of all working with the survivors where they are still alive and then seeing what they want.  The rule is survivors come first, not our own interests, and however important the person was, however distinguished, however well-known, survivors come first. (Justin Welby)}}

The personal files of all Church of England clergy since the 1950s are being audited in an effort to ensure no cover-up. Welby emphasised repeatedly that no cover-up would be acceptable.<ref>[https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2014/oct/27/justin-welby-1950s-personnel-files-clergy-child-abuse-investigation-confessional-confidentiality "Church of England to examine 1950s records in child abuse investigation"], ''The Guardian'', 27 October 2014.</ref>

Despite such assurances there is concern that not enough may be done and historic abuse may still sometimes be covered up. [[Keith Porteous Wood]] of the [[National Secular Society]] stated:
{{quote|The problem wasn't that bishops weren't trained in such matters, it is the institutional culture of denial and the bullying of the abused and whistleblowers into silence. One report suggests that 13 bishops ignored letters written in the 1990s warning of abuse by Ball on behalf of a victim who later committed suicide. I have seen evidence that such bullying persists to this day. I hope that the Archbishop's review into the case of Peter Ball will deal with such bullying and what appears to be the undue influence exerted on the police and CPS by the Church in dealing with this case. The total failure of procedures, outlined by Ian Elliott, echoes that revealed in the totally damning Cahill Report about the conduct of the Archbishop Hope of York in respect of Robert Waddington. The current Archbishop of York has decided that this report should remain in printed form rather than be more widely available on the web.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.secularism.org.uk/news/2016/03/church-cut-contact-with-child-abuse-victim-on-order-of-insurers|title=Church cut contact with child abuse victim on order of insurers|date=16 March 2016|publisher=}}</ref>}}

Bishop [[Peter Ball (bishop)|Peter Ball]] was convicted in October 2015 on several charges of indecent assault against young adult men.<ref name=sentence2015>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2015/oct/07/bishop-peter-ball-escaped-charges-mps-royal-family-intervened-court|title=Bishop escaped abuse charges after MPs and a royal backed him, court told |date=7 October 2015|accessdate=27 November 2015|publisher=[[The Guardian]]|last=Laville|first=Sandra}}</ref> There are allegations of large-scale earlier cover-ups involving many British establishment figures which prevented Ball's earlier prosecution. There have also been allegations of [[child sex abuse]], for example [[Robert Waddington#Allegations of abuse|Robert Waddington]]. A complainant, known only as "Joe", tried for decades to have action taken over sadistic sex abuse which Garth Moore perpetrated against him in 1976 when "Joe" was 15 years old. None of the high ranking clergy who "Joe" spoke to recall being told about the abuse, which "Joe" considers incredible.<ref>[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/mar/15/damning-report-reveals-church-of-england-failure-to-act-on-abuse "Damning report reveals Church of England's failure to act on abuse"], ''[[The Guardian]]'', 26 March 2015.</ref> A representative of the solicitors firm representing "Joe" said: 
{{quote|The Church of England wants to bury and discourage allegations of non-recent abuse. They know how difficult it is for survivors to come forward, and it appears from this case that the Church has a plan of making it hard for these vulnerable people to come forward. This survivor has had the courage to press his case. Most do not. Most harbour the psychological fallout in silence. We need to find a way to make the system more approachable for survivors.<ref>[https://www.churchtimes.co.uk/articles/2015/4-december/news/uk/survivor-reaches-settlement-with-diocese-on-historic-abuse "Survivor reaches settlement with diocese on historic abuse"], ''Church Times'', 4 December 2015.</ref>}}

==Financial situation==
{{Main|Properties and finances of the Church of England}}
Although an [[established church]], the Church of England does not receive any direct government support. Donations comprise its largest source of income, and it also relies heavily on the income from its various historic endowments. In 2005, the Church of England had estimated total outgoings of around £900&nbsp;million.<ref>[http://www.cofe.anglican.org/info/funding/ outgoings]. Cofe.anglican.org.</ref>

The Church of England manages an [[investment portfolio]] which is worth more than £8&nbsp;billion.<ref>"Citing ethics, Anglicans sell stake in News Corp" by Eric Pfanner, ''[[The New York Times]]'', 8 August 2012.</ref>

==Online church directory==
The Church of England supports ''A Church Near You'', an [[online]] directory of churches. A user-edited resource, it currently lists 16,400 churches and has 7,000 editors in 42 dioceses.<ref>{{cite web|title=A Church Near You Help|url=http://www.achurchnearyou.com/help/|website=achurchnearyou.com|publisher=A Church Near You|accessdate=25 December 2015}}</ref> The directory enables parishes to maintain accurate location, contact and event information which is shared with other websites and [[mobile app]]s. In 2012, the directory formed the data backbone of Christmas Near You<ref>[http://www.bristol.anglican.org/event/find-christmas-events-near-you/ Christmas Near You Announcement] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20140807162230/http://www.bristol.anglican.org/event/find-christmas-events-near-you/ |date=7 August 2014 }} Accessed: 6 August 2014</ref> and in 2014 was used to promote the church's Harvest Near You initiative.<ref>[https://www.churchofengland.org/media-centre/news/2014/08/connect-with-food,-farming-countryside-at-a-harvest-near-you.aspx Harvest Near You announcement], Accessed 6 August 2014.</ref>
