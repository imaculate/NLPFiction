The '''Society of the Cincinnati''' is a [[lineage society|hereditary society]] with branches in the [[United States]] and [[France]], founded in 1783, to preserve the ideals and fellowship of officers of the [[Continental Army]] who served in the [[American Revolutionary War|Revolutionary War]].  <!-- The city of [[Cincinnati, Ohio]], then a small village, shares its name with the Society.-->  Now in its third century, the Society promotes the public interest in the [[American Revolution|revolution]] through its library and museum collections, publications, and other activities. It is the oldest hereditary society in the United States. The Society does not allow women to join, though there is a partnership society called [[Daughters of the Cincinnati]] which permits all female descendants of Continental officers.

The Society is named after [[Lucius Quinctius Cincinnatus]], who left his farm to accept a term as [[Roman consul|Roman Consul]] and served as [[Roman dictator|Magister Populi]] (with temporary powers similar to that of a modern-era dictator).  He assumed lawful dictatorial control of [[Roman Republic|Rome]] to meet a war emergency. When the battle was won, he returned power to the [[Roman Senate|Senate]] and went back to plowing his fields. The Society's motto reflects that ethic of selfless service: ''Omnia reliquit servare rempublicam'' ("He relinquished everything to save the Republic").<ref name=Lewis1900>Lewis, Alonzo Norton. ''The Venerable and Illustrious Order of the Cincinnati : "Omnia reliquit servare rempublicam." : 1783-1900 : History of the Connecticut State Society'', Hartford, Conn., 1900.</ref> The Society has had three goals: "To preserve the rights so dearly won; to promote the continuing union of the states; and to assist members in need, their widows, and their orphans."

The concept of the Society of the Cincinnati was that of [[Major General (United States)|Major General]] [[Henry Knox]].<ref>[[#chernow|Chernow, 2010]], p.444</ref> The first meeting of the Society was held in May 1783 at a dinner at [[Mount Gulian]] (Verplanck House) in [[Fishkill, New York]], before the British [[Evacuation Day (New York)|evacuation from New York City]]. The meeting was chaired by [[Lieutenant Colonel (United States)|Lieutenant Colonel]] [[Alexander Hamilton]], and the participants agreed to stay in contact with each other after the war.<ref>[[#puls|Pils, 2008]], p. 184</ref> Membership was generally limited to [[Officer (armed forces)|officers]] who had served at least three years in the [[Continental Army]] or [[Continental Navy|Navy]]; it included officers of the [[Military history of France|French Army]] and [[History of the French Navy|Navy]] above certain [[Military rank|ranks]].  Officers in the Continental Line who died during the War were also entitled to be recorded as members, and membership would devolve to their eldest male heir.  Members of the considerably larger fighting forces comprising the Colonial Militias and [[Minutemen]] were not entitled to join the Society.

Within 12 months of the founding, a constituent Society had been organized in each of the [[Thirteen Colonies|13 states]] and in [[France]]. Of about 5,500 men originally eligible for membership, 2,150 had joined within a year. [[Louis XVI of France|King Louis XVI]] ordained the '''French Society of the Cincinnati''', which was organized on July 4, 1784 ([[Independence Day (United States)|Independence Day]]). Up to that time, the King of France had not allowed his officers to wear any foreign decorations, but he made an exception in favor of the badge of the Cincinnati.

Later in the 18th century, the Society's rules adopted a system of [[primogeniture]] wherein membership was passed down to the eldest son after the death of the original member. Present-day hereditary members generally must be descended from an officer who served in the Continental Army or Navy for at least three years, from an officer who died or was killed in service, or from an officer serving at the close of the [[American Revolution|Revolution]].  Each officer may be represented by only one descendant at any given time, following the rules of [[primogeniture]].  (The rules of eligibility and admission are controlled by each of the 14 Constituent Societies to which members are admitted. They differ slightly in each society, and some allow more than one descendant of an eligible officer.)  The requirement for primogeniture made the society controversial in its early years, as the new states quickly did away with laws supporting primogeniture as remnants of the English feudal system.

[[George Washington]] was elected the first President General of the Society. He served from December 1783 until his death in 1799. The second President General was [[Alexander Hamilton]]. Upon Hamilton's death the third President General of the Society was [[Charles Cotesworth Pinckney]].

The society's members have included notable military and political leaders, including 23 signers of the [[United States Constitution]].

==Insignia==
[[Image:Order of the cincinnati.gif|right|thumb|100px|Society of the Cincinnati eagle, drawing from B.J. Lossing's ''Pictoral Field Book of the Revolution'']]
On June 19, 1783, the General Society of the Cincinnati adopted the [[bald eagle]] as its insignia.  It is one of America's first post-revolution symbols and an important piece of American [[iconography]].  It is the second official American emblem to use the bald eagle, following the [[Great Seal of the United States]].  The insignia may have been derived from the same discourse that produced the seal.

The suggestion of the bald eagle as the Cincinnati insignia was made by [[Major (United States)|Major]] [[Pierre L'Enfant]], a French officer who joined the American Army in 1777, served in the [[United States Army Corps of Engineers|Corps of Engineers]], and became one of the first members of the Society.  He observed that "[t]he Bald Eagle, which is unique to this continent, and is distinguished from those of other climates by its white head and tail, appears to me to deserve attention."<ref>Autograph letter signed. Pierre L'Enfant to Baron de Steuben, June 10, 1783. Society of the Cincinnati Archives, Washington, D.C.</ref>  In 1783, L'Enfant was commissioned to travel to France to have the first Eagle badges made, based on his design. (L'Enfant later planned and partially laid out the city of [[Washington, D.C.]])

The [[medallion]]s at the center of the Cincinnati American Eagle depict, on the [[Obverse and reverse|obverse]], Cincinnatus receiving his sword from Roman senators and, on the [[Obverse and reverse|reverse]], Cincinnatus at his plow being crowned by the figure of [[Pheme]] (a [[personification]] of [[celebrity|fame]]).  The Society's colors, light blue and white, symbolize the fraternal bond between the [[Franco-American relations|United States and France]].

A specially commissioned "Eagle" worn by President General George Washington was presented to [[Gilbert du Motier, marquis de La Fayette|Marquis de Lafayette]] in 1824 [[Visit of the Marquis de Lafayette to the United States (1824-25)|during his grand tour of the United States]].  This badge remained in possession of the Lafayette family<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.maineantiquedigest.com/stories/index.html?id=216 |title=Sotheby's to Sell Badge Owned by Washington and Lafayette |publisher=Maine Antique Digest}}</ref> until sold at auction on December 11, 2007, for 5.3 million [[United States dollar|USD]] by Lafayette's great-great granddaughter.  Together with what are believed to be the original ribbon and red leather box, the badge was purchased by the [[Josée and René de Chambrun Foundation]] for display in Lafayette's bedroom at Chateau La Grange, his former home, thirty miles east of [[Paris]]; it may also be displayed at [[Mount Vernon]], Washington's former home in Virginia.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.usrarecoininvestments.com/coin_articles/odd_lafayette_medal.htm |title=Washington medal sells in NYC for $5.3M |agency=Associated Press |date=December 11, 2007}}</ref>  This was one of three eagles known to have been owned by Washington, who most often wore the "[[diamond]] eagle," a diamond-encrusted badge given him by the French ''matelots'' ([[sailor]]s).  That diamond eagle continues to be passed down to each President General of the Society of the Cincinnati as part of his induction into office.

The Cincinnati Eagle is displayed in various places of public importance, including in [[Fountain Square, Cincinnati|Fountain Square]] in Cincinnati (named for the Society), [[Ohio]], alongside the [[Flag of the United States|American]] and municipal flags. The flag of the Society displays blue and white stripes and a dark blue [[Canton (heraldry)|canton]] (containing a circle of 14 stars around the Cincinnati Eagle, representing the fourteen subsidiary societies, one each in the thirteen original States and France) in the upper corner next to the hoist.  Refer to the [[Society of the Cincinnati#Later activities|section below]] for the city's historical connection to the Cincinnati.

On ceremonial occasions, members may wear their badges on their American military uniforms.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/USCODE-2010-title10/pdf/USCODE-2010-title10-subtitleA-partII-chap57-sec1123.pdf |format=PDF |title=Title 10 - Armed Forces |page=707 |publisher=Gpo.gov |accessdate=August 11, 2015}}</ref>

==Criticism==
When news of the foundation of the society spread, judge [[Aedanus Burke]] published several pamphlets under the pseudonym ''Cassius'' where he criticized the society as an attempt at reestablishing a hereditary nobility in the new republic.<ref>Doyle, 2009, p. 102ff.</ref> The pamphlets, entitled ''An Address to the Freemen of South Carolina'' (January 1783) and ''Considerations on the Society or Order of Cincinnati'' (October 1783) sparked a general debate that included prominent names, including [[Thomas Jefferson]]<ref>Doyle, 2009, p. 114ff.</ref> and [[John Adams]].<ref>Doyle, 2009, p. 133ff.</ref> The criticism voiced concern about the apparent creation of an hereditary elite; membership eligibility is inherited through [[primogeniture]], and generally excluded [[Enlisted rank|enlisted men]] and [[militia]] officers, unless they were placed under "State Line" or "Continental Line" forces for a substantial time period, and their descendants. [[Benjamin Franklin]] was among the Society's earliest critics.  He was concerned about the creation of a quasi-[[Order (decoration)|noble order]], and of the Society's use of the eagle in its emblem, as evoking the traditions of [[heraldry]] and the English aristocracy. In a letter to his daughter [[Sarah Franklin Bache|Sarah Bache]] written on January 26, 1784, Franklin commented on the ramifications of the Cincinnati:

<blockquote>I only wonder that, when the united Wisdom of our Nation had, in the Articles of Confederation, manifested their Dislike of establishing Ranks of Nobility, by Authority either of the Congress or of any particular State, a Number of private persons should think proper to distinguish themselves and their Posterity, from their fellow Citizens, and form an Order of ''hereditary Knights'', in direct Opposition to the solemnly declared Sense of their Country.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Sparks|first1=Jared|title=The Works of Benjamin Franklin: Containing Several Political and Historical Tracts Not Included in Any Former Edition, and Many Letters, Official and Private, Not Hitherto Published; with Notes and a Life of the Author, Volume 10|date=1844|publisher=Charles Tappan|location=Louisville, Kentucky|page=58|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8jVP_HZMIDQC&pg=PA58&lpg=PA58&dq=%22Dislike+of+establishing+Ranks+of+Nobility%22&source=bl&ots=DkTwc1Oz4z&sig=HaaIlgQhmwecdKVXE7bsuvvkn50&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjh7eTLtaDXAhVEWxoKHRbyAooQ6AEIKTAB#v=onepage&q=%22Dislike%20of%20establishing%20Ranks%20of%20Nobility%22&f=false}}</ref></blockquote>
The influence of the Cincinnati members, former officers, was another concern. When delegates to the [[Philadelphia Convention|Constitutional Convention]] were debating the method of choosing a [[President of the United States|president]], [[James Madison]] (the secretary of the Convention) reported the following speech of [[Elbridge Gerry]] of [[Massachusetts]]:
<blockquote>A popular election in this case is radically vicious. The ignorance of the people would put it in the power of some one set of men dispersed through the Union & acting in Concert to delude them into any appointment. He observed that such a Society of men existed in the Order of the Cincinnati. They are respectable, United, and influential. They will in fact elect the chief Magistrate in every instance, if the election be referred to the people. [Gerry's] respect for the characters composing this Society could not blind him to the danger & impropriety of throwing such a power into their hands.<ref>[http://www.yale.edu/lawweb/avalon/debates/725.htm "The Debates in the Federal Convention of 1787, reported by James Madison", 25 July 1787] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060829141408/http://www.yale.edu/lawweb/avalon/debates/725.htm |date=August 29, 2006 }}, Yale Law School</ref></blockquote>

The debate spread to France on account of the eligibility of French veterans from the Revolutionary War. In 1785 [[Honoré Gabriel Riqueti, comte de Mirabeau]] was approached by Franklin, who was at the time stationed in Paris and suggested to him to write something about the society directed at the French public.<ref>Doyle, 2009, p. 122.</ref> Mirabeau was provided with Burke's pamphlets and Franklin's letter to his daughter, and from this, with the help of [[Nicolas Chamfort]], created his own enlarged version entitled ''Considérations sur l'Ordre de Cincinnatus'' which was published in London November that year, an English translation carried out by [[Samuel Romilly]] followed, of which an American edition was published in 1786.<ref>Doyle, 2009, p. 123.</ref>

Following this public debate and criticism, George Washington, who had been unaware of the particulars of the charter when he agreed to become president of the society, began to have doubts about the benefit of the society. He had in fact considered abolishing the society on its very first general meeting May 4, 1784.<ref>Doyle, 2009, p. 115-16.</ref> However, in the mean time Major L'Enfant had arrived bringing his designs of the diplomas and medals, as well as news of the success of the society in France, which made an abolishment of the society impossible. Washington instead at the meeting launched an ultimatum, that if the clauses about heredity were not abandoned, he would resign from his post as president of the society. This was accepted, and furthermore informal agreement was made not to wear the eagles in public, so as not to resemble European chivalrous orders. A new charter, the so-called ''Institution'', was printed, which omitted among others the disputed clauses about heredity. This was sent to the local chapters for approval, and it was approved in all of them except for the chapters in New York, New Hampshire and Delaware. However, when the public furor about the society had died down, the new ''Institution'' was rescinded, and the original reintroduced, including the clauses about heredity.<ref>Doyle, 2009, p. 117-18.</ref>

The French chapter, who had obtained official permission to form from the king [[Louis XVI of France]], also abolished heredity, but never reintroduced it, and thus the last members were approved February 3, 1792, shortly before the French monarchy was disbanded.<ref>Doyle, 2009, p. 131.</ref>

==Later activities==
===City development by early members===
The members of the Cincinnati were among those developing many of America's first and largest cities to the west of the Appalachians, most notably [[Cincinnati, Ohio]] and [[Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania]].

The first governor of the [[Northwest Territory]], [[Arthur St. Clair]], was a member of the Society. He renamed a small settlement "Cincinnati" to honor the Society and to encourage settlement by Society members. Among them were Captain Jacob Piatt, who settled across the river from Cincinnati in northern Kentucky on land granted to him for his service during the War. Captain [[David Ziegler]] was the first Mayor of Cincinnati.

Lt. [[Ebenezer Denny]] (1761–1822), an original Pennsylvanian Cincinnatus, was elected the first mayor of the incorporated city of Pittsburgh in 1816. Pittsburgh developed from [[Fort Pitt (Pennsylvania)|Fort Pitt]], which had been commanded since 1777-1783 by four men who were founding members of the Society.

[[Richard Varick]] was a [[Mayor of New York City]].

===Public awareness===
Today's Society supports efforts to increase public awareness and memory of the ideals and actions of the men who created the American Revolution and an understanding of American history, with an emphasis on the period from the outset of the Revolution to the War of 1812. At its headquarters at Anderson House in Washington, DC, the Society holds manuscript, portrait, and model collections pertaining to events of and military science during this period.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://societyofthecincinnati.org/collections/library/about |title=The Society of the Cincinnati|publisher=Societyofthecincinnati.org |accessdate=September 2, 2012}}</ref> Members of the Society have contributed to endow professorships, lecture series, awards, and educational materials in relation to the United States' representative democracy.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://societyofthecincinnati.org/about/purpose/vision |title=The Society of the Cincinnati: Strategic Vision |publisher=Societyofthecincinnati.org|accessdate=September 2, 2012}}</ref> The definition and acceptance of membership has remained with the constituent societies rather than with the General Society in Washington.

The Society maintains a tradition of service in American government, especially in the federal executive branch.  Members of the society have served in the Armed Forces, the State Department and other parts of the executive branch.

===Membership rules===
Over the years, membership rules have continued as first established. They provide for approving the application of a collateral heir if the direct male line dies out. Membership has been expanded in some state societies to include descendants of those who died during the war, but it remains limited.

An officer of the Continental army during the Revolutionary War can generally be represented in the Society of The Cincinnati by only one descendant at a time. The only U.S. President who was a true hereditary member was [[Franklin Pierce]]. The General Society no longer admits honorary members. [[Andrew Jackson]] and [[Zachary Taylor]] were honorary members before becoming presidents. Other presidents became honorary members while in office, and after leaving office.
Each of the fourteen constituent societies has honorary members, but these men cannot designate an heir (referred to as a successor member).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.societyofthecincinnati.org/about/membership|title=Society of the Cincinnati - About Membership}}</ref>

The American Independence Museum is a private, not-for-profit institution whose mission is to provide a place for the study, research, education and interpretation of the American Revolution and of the role that New Hampshire, Exeter, and the Gilman family played in the founding of the new republic. Museum collections include two rare drafts of the U.S. Constitution, an original [[Dunlap Broadside]] of the United States Declaration of Independence, as well as an original [[Badge of Military Merit]], awarded by George Washington to soldiers demonstrating extraordinary bravery.  Exhibits highlight the Society of the Cincinnati, the nation’s oldest veterans’ society, and its first president, George Washington.
