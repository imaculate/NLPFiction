Craft-scale soap making has a variety of adherents, both those who practice it as a hobby and to keep traditional soap making methods alive, and consumers who prefer traditional handmade products as alternatives to mass-produced industrial offerings and as a contribution to a more [[sustainable]] means of living.

A "soaper" is also slang for [[Methaqualone|Quaaludes]].
