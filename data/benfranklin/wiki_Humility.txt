Humility is an outward expression of an appropriate inner, or self regard, and is contrasted with [[humiliation]] which is an imposition, often external, of [[shame]] upon a person.  Humility may be misappropriated as ability to suffer humiliation through self-denouncements which in itself remains focus on self rather than low self-focus.<ref name="Schwarzer 2012">{{cite book | last=Schwarzer | first=Ralf | title=Personality, human development, and culture : international perspectives on psychological science | publisher=Psychology | location=Hove | year=2012 | isbn=978-0-415-65080-9 | pages=127–129}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|author1=Jeff Greenberg|author2=Sander L.

Humility, in various interpretations, is widely seen as a [[virtue]] which centers on low self-preoccupation, or unwillingness to put oneself forward, so it is in many religious and philosophical traditions, it contrasts with [[narcissism]], [[hubris]] and other forms of [[pride]] and is an idealistic and rare intrinsic construct that has an extrinsic side.

==Term==
The term "humility" comes from the [[Latin language|Latin]] word ''[[wikt:humilitas#Latin|humilitas]]'', a noun related to the adjective ''{{lang|la|[[wikt:humilis#Latin|humilis]]}}'', which may be translated as "humble", but also as "grounded", or "from the earth", since it derives from ''{{lang|la|[[wikt:humus#Latin|humus]]}}'' (earth). See the English ''[[humus]]''.<ref>[http://www.m-w.com/dictionary/humble "Humble" from Merriam-Webster], m-w.com</ref>

The word "humble" may be related to feudal England where the lowest cuts of meat, or 'umbles' <ref>[http://www.fallow-deer-project.net/img/upload/370/documents/1066%20and%20all%20that.PDF</ref>,' that is to say whatever was left over when the upper classes had taken their parts, were provided to the lowest class of citizen.  The term 'humble pie,' meaning to exist in a lowly station, may derive from this definition.

==Mythology==
[[Aidos]], in Greek mythology, was the ''daimona'' (goddess) of shyness, shame, and humility.<ref>Thomas Scheff and Suzanne Retzinger, Emotions and Violence: shame and rage in destructive conflicts, {{ISBN|0-595-21190-9}}, page 7</ref> She was the quality that restrained human beings from wrong.

==Religious views of humility==

===Abrahamic===

====Judaism====
Rabbi Lord [[Jonathan Sacks]] states that in Judaism humility is an appreciation of oneself, one's talents, skills, and virtues.  It is not meekness or self-deprecating thought, but the effacing of oneself to something higher.  Humility is not to think lowly of oneself, but to appreciate the self one has received. In recognition of the mysteries and complexities of life, one becomes humbled to the awesomeness of what one is and what one can achieve.  Rabbi [[Pini Dunner]] discusses that humility is to place others first; it is to appreciate others' worth as important.  In recognizing our worth as people, Rabbi Dunner shows that looking into the zillions of stars in the sky, and in the length and history of time, you and I are insignificant, like dust. Rabbi Dunner states that Moses wrote in the Torah, "And Moses was exceedingly humble, more than any man on the face of the earth." How is it possible to be humble and write you are the most humble? The conclusion is that Moses knew he was humble. It is not in denial of your talents and gifts but to recognize them and live up to your worth and something greater.  It is in the service to others that is the greatest form of humility.<ref>http://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/160968/jewish/What-is-Humility.htm</ref><ref>http://www.chabad.org/parshah/article_cdo/aid/1932762/jewish/Greatness-is-Humility.htm</ref><ref>http://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/83807/jewish/On-Humility.htm</ref><ref>http://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/1218750/jewish/Humility.htm</ref>

As illustrated in the person of [[Moses]], who leads the nation of [[Hebrews]] out of slavery in Egypt and to the “Promised Land”, humility is a sign of Godly strength and purpose, not weakness. Of this great leader, the Bible states, “For Moses was a man exceeding meek above all men that dwelt upon earth" ({{bibleref|Numbers|12:3}}).  Moses is venerated by Jewish, Christian and Muslim adherents alike.

Amongst the benefits of humility described in the [[Hebrew Bible]], that is shared by many faiths, are [[honor]], [[wisdom]], [[prosperity]], the protection of the Lord and [[peace]]. In addition, "God opposes the proud but gives grace to the  humble" ({{bibleref|Proverbs|3:34}})

====Christianity====

{{Quote box|quote=Do nothing out of selfish ambition or vain conceit. Rather, in humility value others above yourselves, not looking to your own interests but each of you to the interests of the others.
In your relationships with one another, have the same mindset as Christ Jesus:
Who, being in very nature God,
did not consider equality with God something to be used to his own advantage;
rather, he made himself nothing
by taking the very nature of a servant,
being made in human likeness.
And being found in appearance as a man,
he humbled himself
by becoming obedient to death—
even death on a cross!
|source=Philippians 2:3-8, NIV<ref>{{cite web|title=Philippians 2|url=http://biblehub.com/niv/philippians/2.htm}}</ref>| align=right|width=30%}}

New Testament exhortations to humility are found in many places, for example "Blessed are the meek" ({{bibleref|Matthew|5}}), "He who exalts himself will be humbled and he who humbles himself will be exalted" ({{bibleref|Matthew|23:12}}), as well as ({{bibleref|Philippians|2:1-17}}) and throughout the [[Epistle of James|Book of James]]. Also in [[Jesus|Jesus Christ's]] behavior in general and submission to unjust torture and execution in particular, are held up as examples of righteous humility: "Who, when he was reviled, did not revile: when he suffered, he threatened not: but delivered himself to him that judged him justly."{{bibleref|1 Peter|2:23}},<ref name="Humility 1860, pp 598-599"/>

[[C.S. Lewis]] writes, in ''[[Mere Christianity]]'', that pride is the "anti-God" state, the position in which the ego and the self are directly opposed to God: "Unchastity, anger, greed, drunkenness, and all that, are mere fleabites in comparison: it was through Pride that the devil became the devil: Pride leads to every other vice: it is the complete anti-God state of mind."<ref>Mere Christianity, C.S. Lewis, {{ISBN|978-0-06-065292-0}}</ref> In contrast, Lewis contends that, in Christian moral teaching, the opposite of pride is humility.  This is popularly illustrated by a  phrase wrongly attributed to Lewis, "Humility is not thinking less of yourself, but thinking of yourself less." This is an apparent paraphrase, by Rick Warren in "The Purpose Driven Life", of a passage found in "[[Mere Christianity]]:" Lewis writes, regarding the truly humble man, {{block quote|Do not imagine that if you meet a really humble man he will be what most people call "humble" nowadays: he will not be a sort of greasy, smarmy person, who is always telling you that, of course, he is nobody. Probably all you will think about him is that he seemed a cheerful, intelligent chap who took a real interest in what you said to him. If you do dislike him it will be because you feel a little envious of anyone who seems to enjoy life so easily. He will not be thinking about humility: he will not be thinking about himself at all.}}

[[St. Augustine]] stresses the importance of humility in the study of the Bible, with the exemplars of a barbarian Christian slave, the apostle Paul, and the Ethiopian eunuch in Acts 8 (''[[De Doctrina Christiana]]'', prooem. 4–7 [hereafter ''DDC'']).  Both learner and teacher need to be humble, because they learn and teach what ultimately belongs to God (''DDC'', prooem. 7–8; 1 Cor. 4:7). Humility is a basic disposition of the interpreter of the Bible. The confidence of the exegete and preacher arises from the conviction that his or her mind depends on God absolutely (''DDC'', 1.1.1). Augustine argues that the interpreter of the Bible should proceed with humility, because only a humble person can grasp the truth of Scripture (''DDC'', 2.41.62).<ref>{{cite journal | last=Woo | first=B. Hoon | title=Augustine’s Hermeneutics and Homiletics in ''De doctrina christiana'' | journal= Journal of Christian Philosophy | year=2013 | volume=17 | url=https://www.academia.edu/5228314/_Augustines_Hermeneutics_and_Homiletics_in_De_doctrina_christianae_Humiliation_Love_Sign_and_Discipline_Journal_of_Christian_Philosophy_17_2013_97-117 |pages=99–103}}</ref>

Humility is said to be a fit recipient of grace; according to the words of St. James, "God opposes the proud but gives grace to the humble" ({{bibleref|Proverbs|3:34}}, {{bibleref|1Peter|5:5}},{{bibleref|James|4:6}}.)

"True humility" is distinctly different from "false humility" which consists of deprecating one's own sanctity, gifts, talents, and accomplishments for the sake of receiving praise or adulation from others, as personified by the [[fictional character]] [[Uriah Heep]] created by [[Charles Dickens]]. In this context legitimate humility comprises the following behaviors and attitudes:
*Submitting to God and legitimate authority 
*Recognizing virtues and talents that others possess, particularly those that surpass one's own, and giving due honor and, when required, obedience
*Recognizing the limits of one's talents, ability, or authority.

The vices opposed to humility are: 
*[[Pride]]  
*Too great [[obsequiousness]] or abjection of oneself; this would be considered an excess of humility, and could easily be derogatory to one's office or holy character; or it might serve only to pamper pride in others, by unworthy flattery, which would occasion their sins of tyranny, arbitrariness, and arrogance. The virtue of humility may not be practiced in any external way that would occasion vices in others.<ref name="CE" />

=====Catholicism=====

[[File:Madonna-of-humility- 1433 Domenico di Bartolo.jpg|thumb|240px| This ''[[Madonna of humility]]'' by [[Domenico di Bartolo]] expresses the symbolic duality of an earthly woman with humility, as well as a [[Queen of Heaven|heavenly queen]].<ref Name =Trinchieri>''Art and music in the early modern period'' by Franca Trinchieri Camiz, Katherine A. McIver {{ISBN|0-7546-0689-9}} [https://books.google.com/books?id=mdIFQTuA4cQC&pg=PA15 page 15]</ref>]]

[[Catholic]] texts view humility as annexed to the [[cardinal virtue]] of [[Temperance (virtue)|temperance]].<ref name="Humility 1910, pp 543-544"/><ref name="CE">[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07543b.htm Catholic Encyclopedia, " Humility"], newadvent.org</ref> It is viewed as a potential part of temperance because temperance includes all those virtues that restrain or express the inordinate movements of our desires or appetites.<ref name="CE" />

[[Bernard of Clairvaux|St. Bernard]] defines it as, "A virtue by which a man knowing himself as he truly is, abases himself. Jesus Christ is the ultimate definition of Humility."<ref name="CE" />

Humility was a virtue extolled by Saint [[Francis of Assisi]], and this form of [[Order of Saint Francis|Franciscan]] piety led to the artistic development of the ''[[Madonna of humility]]'' first used by them for [[Christian contemplation|contemplation]].<ref>''A history of ideas and images in Italian art'' by James Hall 1983 {{ISBN|0-06-433317-5}} page 223</ref><ref>''Iconography of Christian Art'' by Gertrud Schiller 1971 ASIN: B0023VMZMA page 112</ref> The [[Madonna (art)|Virgin]] of humility sits on the ground, or upon a low cushion, unlike the ''Enthroned Madonna'' representations.<ref>''Renaissance Art: A Topical Dictionary'' by Irene Earls 1987 {{ISBN|0-313-24658-0}} page 174</ref> This style of painting spread quickly through Italy and by 1375 examples began to appear in Spain, France and Germany and it became the most popular among the styles of the early [[Trecento]] artistic period.<ref name=Meiss>''Painting in Florence and Siena after the Black Death'' by Millard Meiss 1979 {{ISBN|0-691-00312-2}} pages 132-133</ref>

[[St. Thomas Aquinas]], a 13th-century philosopher and theologian in the [[Scholasticism|Scholastic]] tradition, defines humility similarly as "the virtue of humility" that "consists in keeping oneself within one's own bounds, not reaching out to things above one, but submitting to one's superior" (Summa Contra Gent., bk. IV, ch. lv, tr. [[Joseph Rickaby]]).

====Islam====
In the [[Qur'an]], various Arabic words conveying the meaning of "humility" are used.  The very term "[[Islam]]" can be interpreted as "surrender (to God), humility”, from the triconsonantal root [[S-L-M]]; other words used are ''tawadu'' and ''khoshou'': <!-- the word "humility" is a noun but the 2 Arabic words used before were verbs, so I changed these to nouns.  In order not to have a discussion about this, I will explain that I know what the previous editor had in mind. The person who used the verbs (which were the past tense of a male 3rd person singular) used what is customarily considered a "root" of the verb, which, for example, is used in finding a word in a dictionary.  This, however, was not warranted here because we just needed to have the exact translation of the noun "humility" -->

In the Tipitaka, in the widely known "[[Mangala Sutta]]", humility (''{{lang-pi|nivato}}'', literally: 'without air') is mentioned as one of the thirty-eight blessings in life.<ref>{{cite book|translator-last=Ñāṇamoli|translator-first=Bhikkhu|translator-link=Nanamoli Bhikkhu|title=The Minor Readings and The Illustrator of Ultimate Meaning|date=1960|publisher=[[Pali Text Society]]|location=London|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2FCToAEACAAJ}}</ref> In the Pali tradition, examples of humility that are often raised are the monk [[Sariputta|Sariputta Thera]], a leading disciple of the Buddha, and Hatthaka, a leading lay disciple. In later Pali texts and [[Atthakatha|Commentaries]], Sariputta Thera is depicted as a forgiving person, who is quick to apologize and accepting of criticism. In the ''[[suttas]]'' (discourses of the Buddha) Hatthaka is praised by the Buddha when he was unwilling to let other people know his good qualities.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Malalasekera|author-link= G P Malalasekera|first1=G.P.|title=Dictionary of Pāli proper names|volume=2|date=2007|orig-year=First published 1937|publisher=[[Motilal Banarsidass Publishers]]|location=Delhi|isbn=8120830229|edition=1st Indian|url=http://www.palikanon.com/english/pali_names/dic_idx.html}}</ref>

In [[Buddhist practice]], humility is practiced in a variety of ways. For example, Japanese [[Soto Zen]] monks bow and chant in honor of their robes before they don them. This serves to remind them of the connection of the monk's robes with enlightenment. Buddhist monks in all traditions are dependent on the generosity of laypeople, through whom they receive their necessities. This in itself is a practice of humility.<ref name="Tachibana 1992"/>{{rp|178}}<ref>{{cite encyclopedia|last1=Tanabe|first1=Willa Jane|encyclopedia=Encyclopedia of Buddhism|title=Robes and clothing|editor1-last=Buswell|editor1-first=Robert E.|date=2004|publisher=[[Thomson Gale|Macmillan Reference USA, Thomson Gale]]|location=New York [u.a.]|isbn=0-02-865720-9|page=732}}</ref>

====Hindu Dharma / Sanathana Dharma====
In Sanskrit literature, the virtue of humility is explained with many terms, some of which use the root word, ''neti'' (sometimes spelled ''nati'', ''nti'', Sanskrit: नति).<ref>[http://www.spokensanskrit.de/index.php?script=HK&beginning=0+&tinput=humility+&trans=Translate&direction=AU Sanskrit translations for Humility] English-Sanskrit Dictionary, Germany</ref><ref>[http://sanskrit.inria.fr/MW/132.html Monier-Williams Sanskrit-English Dictionary], see explanation under the term नति [ nati ], France</ref> "नति" comes from "न ति" or 'No "Me" / I am not'. Related words include ''viniti'' (विनति), ''samniti'' (संनति, humility towards), and the concept ''amanitvam'', listed as the first virtue in the [[Bhagwad Gita]].<ref>[http://www.bhagavad-gita.org/Gita/verse-13-06.html Bhagwad Gita 13.8-12] See transliteration, and two commentaries.</ref> ''Amanitvam'' is a fusion word for "pridelessness" and the virtue of "humility".<ref>''Hindu spirituality: Postclassical and modern'' edited by K. R. Sundararajan, Bithika Mukerji; {{ISBN|978-8120819375}}; see pages 403-405</ref> Other related concepts are ''namrata'' (नम्रता), which means ''modest and humble behavior''.

Different scholars have varying interpretations for the concept of ''amanitvam'', humility, as virtue in the Bhagwad Gita.<ref>Gupta, B. (2006). BHAGAVAD GĪTĀ AS DUTY AND VIRTUE ETHICS. Journal of Religious Ethics, 34(3), 373-395.</ref> For example, Prabhupada explains humility to mean one should not be anxious to have the satisfaction of being honored by others.<ref>''BHAGAVAD GITA AS IT IS'' - By His Divine Grace A.C.Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada.</ref> The material conception of life makes us very eager to receive honor from others, but from the point of view of a man in perfect knowledge—who knows that he is not this body—anything, honor or dishonor, pertaining to this body is useless. Jopson explains ''amanitvam'', humility, as lack of arrogance and pride, and one of twenty-six virtues in a human being that if perfected, leads one to a divine state of living and the ultimate truth.<ref>Tanya Jopson, ''Human Energy-Body Awareness: How Our Energy Body & Vibrational Frequency Create Our Everyday Life'', {{ISBN|978-1466333413}}, see Divine Qualities under Glossary</ref><ref>Bhawuk, D. P. (2011). Epistemology and Ontology of Indian Psychology. In Spirituality and Indian Psychology (pp. 163-184). Springer New York.</ref> [[Eknath Easwaran]] writes that the Gita's subject is "the war within, the struggle for self-mastery that every human being must wage if he or she is to emerge from life victorious",<ref>Eknath Easwaran, ''The Bhagavad Gita'' (2007), {{ISBN|978-1-58638-019-9}} p. 15.</ref> and "The language of battle is often found in the scriptures, for it conveys the strenuous, long, drawn-out campaign we must wage to free ourselves from the tyranny of the ego, the cause of all our suffering and sorrow".<ref>Eknath Easwaran, ''The End of Sorrow: The Bahagavad Gita for Daily Living (vol 1)'' (1993), {{ISBN|978-0-915132-17-1}}  p. 24.</ref> To get in touch with your true self, whether you call that [[God]], [[Brahman]], etc., one has to let go of the ego.  The [[Sanskrit]] word [[Ahamkara]] literally translates into The-sound-of-I, or quite simply the sense of the self or ego.

[[Mahatma Gandhi|Mahatma Gandhi]] interprets the concept of ''humility'' in Hindu Dharma much more broadly, where humility is an essential virtue that must exist in a person for other virtues to emerge. To Mahatma Gandhi, Truth can be cultivated, as well as Love, but Humility cannot be cultivated. Humility has to be one of the starting points. He states, "Humility cannot be an observance by itself. For it does not lend itself to being practiced. It is however an indispensable test of [[ahimsa]] (non-violence)." Humility must not be confused with mere manners; a man may prostrate himself before another, but if his heart is full of bitterness for the other, it is not humility. Sincere humility is how one feels inside, it's a state of mind. A humble person is not himself conscious of his humility, states Mahatma Gandhi.<ref>[http://www.mkgandhi.org/swmgandhi/chap02.htm Humility The Gita and Satyagraha; The Philosophy of Non-violence and The Doctrine of the Sword], SELECTED WRITINGS OF MAHATMA GANDHI</ref><ref>Stephen S. Hall, Wisdom, {{ISBN|978-0-307-26910-2}}; see Chapter 8</ref>

[[Swami Vivekananda|Swami Vivekananda]], one of the scholars of Hindu Dharma in the 19th century, argues that the concept of humility does not mean "crawling on all fours and calling oneself a sinner." In Vivekananda's Hindu Dharma, each human being being the Universal, recognizing and feeling oneness with everyone and everything else in the universe, without inferiority or superiority or any other bias, is the mark of humility.<ref>Swami Vivekananda, The Complete Works of the Swami Vivekananda, Volume 1 (1915); see page 343</ref> To [[Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan|Dr. S Radhakrishnan]], humility in Hindu Dharma is the non-judgmental state of mind when we are best able to learn, contemplate and understand everyone and everything else.<ref>Radhakrishnan & Muirhead, Contemporary Indian Philosophy (1936), Allen 7 Sons (London)</ref>

Guru Nanak described living an "active, creative, and practical life" of "truthfulness, fidelity, self-control and purity" as being higher than a purely contemplative life.<ref name="Marwha">{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ROtEr_QdB3sC&pg=PA205 | title=Colors of Truth, Religion Self and Emotions | publisher=Concept Publishing Company | author=Marwha, Sonali Bhatt | year=2006 | location=New Delhi | pages=205 | isbn=818069268X}}</ref>

====Baba Nand Singh Ji====
Baba Nand Singh Sahib is renowned as the most humble Sikh Saint in the history of Sikhism. Once the disciples of Baba Harnam Singh Ji, the spiritual preceptor of Baba Nand Singh Ji Maharaj asked him how much power He had transmitted to Baba Nand Singh Ji Maharaj to which He replied<ref name="sggs2">{{Cite web|url=http://www.babanandsinghsahib.org/powers/index.htm|title=Repository of Infinite Divine Powers|website=www.babanandsinghsahib.org|access-date=2017-01-01}}</ref>

{{Quote|text=''"Rikhi Nand Singh holds in His hand Infinite Divine Powers. By just opening His fist He can create as many such-like universes as He likes and by closing the same fist can withdraw all those universes unto Himself.''

''But the whole beauty is that being the supreme Repository of all the Infinite Divine Powers, He claims to be nothing and is so humble."''|sign=Baba Harnam Singh Ji Maharaj}}

Baba Nand Singh Ji Maharaj was humbler than the humblest in spirit and He outshines everyone at the pinnacle of all spiritual glory.

Sri Guru Arjan Sahib says in Sukhmani Sahib:

{{Quote|text="Brahm Giani Sab Shresht Ka Karta
Brahm Giani Sad Jiwe Nahin Marta
...
Brahm Giani Ka Sagal Akar
Brahm Giani Aap Nirankar."''Translated it means: A true Brahm Giani is the creator of the whole universe. Brahm Giani lives through eternity; He never dies.Brahm Giani pervades the whole manifest creation. Brahm Giani is Himself the formless Universal Lord.''|sign=[[Sri Guru Granth Sahib]], 273|source=<ref name="sggs2" />}}

====Meher Baba====
The spiritual teacher [[Meher Baba]] held that humility is one of the foundations of devotional life: "Upon the altar of humility we must offer our prayers to God."<ref>[[Meher Baba|Baba, Meher]] (1967). ''Discourses''. '''3'''. San Francisco: Sufism Reoriented. p. 129. {{ISBN|978-1-880619-09-4}}.</ref>  Baba also described the power of humility to overcome hostility: "True humility is strength, not weakness. It disarms antagonism and ultimately conquers it."<ref>[[Meher Baba|Baba, Meher]] (1957). ''Life at Its Best''. San Francisco: Sufism Reoriented. pp. 25-26. {{ISBN|978-0-525-47434-0}}.</ref> Finally, Baba emphasized the importance of being humble when serving others: "''One of the most difficult things to learn is to render service without bossing, without making a fuss about it and without any consciousness of high and low. In the world of spirituality, humility counts at least as much as utility''."<ref>[[Meher Baba|Baba, Meher]] (1933). ''The Sayings of Shri Meher Baba.'' London: The Circle Editorial Committee. pp. 11-12.</ref>

====Taoism====
{{Quote box|quote=Here are my three treasures.<br/>
Guard and keep them! <br/>
The first is pity; the second, frugality; the third, refusal to be "foremost of all things under heaven". <br/>
For only he that pities is truly able to be brave; <br/>
Only he that is frugal is able to be profuse. <br/>
Only he that refuses to be foremost of all things <br/>
Is truly able to become chief of all Ministers. <br/>
At present your bravery is not based on pity, nor your profusion on frugality, nor your vanguard on your rear; and this is death. |source=(translation of the [[Tao Te Ching]]) by [[Arthur Waley]] 1958:225| align=right|width=25%}}

Humility, in Taoism, is defined as a refusal to assert authority or a refusal to be first in anything and that the act of daring, in itself, is a refusal of wisdom and a rush to enjoin circumstances before you are ready.  Along with [[compassion]] and [[frugality]], humility is one the [[Three Treasures (Taoism)|three treasures]] (virtues) in the possession of those who follow the  [[Tao]].<ref name="Lao Tzu 1997"/>

The treasure of humility, in Chinese is a six-character phrase instead of a single word: ''Bugan wei tianxia xian'' 不敢為天下先 "not dare to be first/ahead in the world". 
Ellen Chen notes<ref name="Lao Tzu 1997">Lao Tzu, Jane English, and Gia-Fu Feng (1997), Tao Te Ching, Vintage Books, {{ISBN|978-0679776192}}</ref><ref>*Chen, Ellen M., 1989, ''The Te Tao Ching: A New Translation with Commentary'', Paragon House.</ref> that
<blockquote>The third treasure, daring not be at the world's front, is the Taoist way to avoid premature death. To be at the world's front is to expose oneself, to render oneself vulnerable to the world's destructive forces, while to remain behind and to be humble is to allow oneself time to fully ripen and bear fruit. This is a treasure whose secret spring is the fear of losing one's life before one's time. This fear of death, out of a love for life, is indeed the key to Taoist wisdom. (1989:209) </blockquote>

Furthermore, also according to the [[Tao Te Ching]] (77.4) a wise person acts without claiming the results as his; he achieves his merit and does not rest (arrogantly) in it: – he does not wish to display his superiority.<ref name="Lao Tzu 1997"/>

===Wicca===

In the numerous traditions of initiatory Wicca, called in the U.S.A. '''British Traditional Wicca''', four paired & balanced qualities are recommended in liturgical texts as having come from the Wiccan Goddess:

{{Quote|text=''"…let there be beauty and strength, power and compassion, honor and humility, mirth and reverence within you."''|sign=Doreen Valiente, ''The Charge of the Goddess,'' prose version}}

In the matter of humility, this deific instruction appropriately pairs being honorable with being humble. Characteristically, this Wiccan "virtue" is balanced by its partner virtue.

==Philosophical views of humility==
[[File:Immanuel Kant (painted portrait).jpg|thumb|[[Immanuel Kant]]]]
[[Immanuel Kant|Kant]]'s view of humility has been defined as "that meta-attitude that constitutes the moral agent's proper perspective on himself as a dependent and corrupt but capable and dignified rational agent".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ndpr.nd.edu/review.cfm?id=4881|title=Kant and the Ethics of Humility|author=ENR // AgencyND // University of Notre Dame|publisher=}}</ref> Kant's notion of humility relies on the centrality of truth and rational thought leading to proper perspective and can therefore be seen as [[emergence|emergent]].

[[Mahatma Gandhi]] is attributed as suggesting that attempting to sustain [[truth]] without humility is doomed to become an "arrogant caricature" of truth.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20060630013653/http://www.geocities.com/rkvenkat/chastity.html Gandhi on Brahmacharya<!-- Bot generated title -->], geocities.com</ref><ref>[http://www.mkgandhi.org/epigrams/h.htm Epigrams from Gandhiji<!-- Bot generated title -->], mkgandhi.org</ref><ref>Rachel Cohon, [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/hume-moral/ Hume's Moral Philosophy] Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (August 2010)</ref><ref>André Vauchez (2002), Encyclopedia of the Middle Ages, see article on ''Humility'', James Clarke & Co, {{ISBN|9780227679319}}</ref>

While many religions and philosophers view humility as a virtue, some have been critical of it, seeing it as opposed to [[individualism]].

[[Nietzsche]] views humility as a [[strategy]] used by the weak to avoid being destroyed by the strong.  In ''[[Twilight of the Idols]]'' he writes: "When stepped on, a worm doubles up. That is clever. In that way he lessens the probability of being stepped on again. In the language of morality:  humility."{{Citation needed|date=April 2016}} He believed that his idealized [[Übermensch]] would be more apt to roam around unfettered by pretensions of humility, proud of his stature and power, but not reveling idly in it, and certainly not displaying [[hubris]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2016}}  But, if so, this would mean the pretension aspect of this kind of humility is more akin to [[obsequiousness]] and to other kinds of pretentious humility.

==Humility and leadership==
Recent research suggests that humility is a quality of certain types of leaders. For example, [[James Collins (bioengineer)|Jim Collins]] and his colleagues found that a certain type of leader, whom they term "level 5", possesses humility and fierce resolve.<ref>{{cite web |last=Collins |first=J. |year=2001 |title= Level 5 leadership: The triumph of humility and fierce resolve |work=Harvard Business Review |pages= 66–76 |accessdate=August 20, 2010 |url=http://www.hr-newcorp.com/articles/Level5%20Leadership_Jim%20Collins.pdf |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091229150239/http://www.hr-newcorp.com/articles/Level5%20Leadership_Jim%20Collins.pdf |archivedate=2009-12-29 |format=PDF}}</ref> Humility is being studied as a trait that can enhance leadership effectiveness. The research suggests that humility is multi-dimensional and includes self-understanding and awareness, openness, and perspective taking.<ref>Morris, J. A., Brotheridge, C. M., & Urbanski, J. C.
