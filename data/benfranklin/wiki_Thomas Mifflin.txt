'''Thomas Mifflin''' (January 10, 1744{{spaced ndash}}January 20, 1800) was an American [[merchant]] and politician from [[Philadelphia]], [[Pennsylvania]]. He served in a variety of roles during and after the [[American Revolution]], several of which qualify him to be counted among the [[Founding Fathers of the United States|Founding Fathers]]. He was the [[List of Governors of Pennsylvania|first]] [[Governor of Pennsylvania]], serving from 1790 to 1799.

Born in [[Philadelphia]], Mifflin became a merchant after graduating from the [[Academy and College of Philadelphia|College of Philadelphia]]. He joined the [[Continental Army]] after serving in the [[Pennsylvania Provincial Assembly]] and the [[Continental Congress]]. During the [[American Revolutionary War]], he served as an aide to General [[George Washington]] and as the Continental Army's [[Quartermaster General of the United States Army|Quartermaster General]], rising to the rank of major general. Mifflin returned to Congress in 1782 and was elected [[President of the Continental Congress]] in 1783. He served as Speaker of the [[Pennsylvania House of Representatives]] from 1785 to 1787 and as [[Supreme Executive Council of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania#Presidents of Council|President]] of the [[Supreme Executive Council of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania|Pennsylvania Supreme Executive Council]] from 1788 to 1790.

Mifflin was a delegate to the 1787 [[Constitutional Convention (United States)|Philadelphia Convention]] and signed the [[United States Constitution]]. He presided over the committee that wrote Pennsylvania's 1790 constitution and became the state's first governor after the ratification of the new state constitution. Mifflin left office as governor in 1799 and died the following year.

Thomas Mifflin was born January 10, 1744 in [[Philadelphia]] in the [[Province of Pennsylvania]]. He was the son of John Mifflin and Elizabeth Bagnall. His great-grandfather John Mifflin Jr. (1661–1714) was born in [[Warminster]], [[Wiltshire]], [[England]] and settled in the [[Province of Pennsylvania]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.geni.com/people/John-Mifflin/6000000006515867542|title=John Mifflin, II|publisher=Geni|accessdate=September 19, 2015}}</ref>

In 1760, Thomas Mifflin graduated from the [[College of Philadelphia]] (now the [[University of Pennsylvania]]) and joined the mercantile business of William Biddle. After returning from a trip to Europe in 1765, he established a commercial business partnership with his brother, George Mifflin.

He married a second cousin, Sarah Morris, on March 4, 1767.<ref name=Egle/> They had no children.<ref name=Egle>{{cite book |first=William Henry |last=Egle |title=Some Pennsylvania Women During the War of the Revolution |year=1898 }} Excerpt at {{cite web |title=Sarah Morris Mifflin |url=https://www.thomasmifflin.com/p/sarah-morris-mifflin.html |first=Stanley |last=Klos |website=President Thomas Mifflin }}</ref>

Early in the [[American Revolutionary War|Revolutionary War]], Mifflin left the Continental Congress to serve in the [[Continental Army]]. He was commissioned as a [[major]], then became an [[Washington's aides-de-camp|''aide-de-camp'']] of [[George Washington]].

On August 14, 1775, Washington appointed him to become the army's first [[Quartermaster general (USA)|Quartermaster General]], under order of Congress.<ref name=Risch>{{cite book |last=Risch |first=Erna |title=Supplying Washington's Army |location=Washington, D.C. |publisher=U.S. Army Center of Military History |year=1981 |url=http://www.history.army.mil/books/RevWar/risch/risch-fm.htm |pages=30–31 }}</ref> Although it has been said that he was good at the job despite preferring to be on the front lines, questions were raised regarding his failure to properly supply Washington and the troops at Valley Forge, alleging that he had instead warehoused and sold supplies intended for Valley Forge to the highest bidder. Reportedly, after Washington confronted him about this,<ref name=Unger>{{cite book |last=Unger |first=Harlow Giles |title=Patrick Henry, Lion of Liberty |publisher=Da Capo Press |year=2010 }}</ref> Mifflin asked to be relieved of the job of Quartermaster General, but was persuaded to resume those duties because Congress was having difficulty finding a replacement.

Mifflin's leadership in the [[Battle of Trenton]] and the [[Battle of Princeton]] led to a promotion to [[major general (United States)|major general]].<ref name=Wright>{{cite book |last1=Wright |first1=Robert K., Jr. |author-link1=Robert K. Wright Jr. |last2=MacGregor |first2=Morris J., Jr. |title=Soldier-Statesmen of the Constitution |chapter-url=http://www.history.army.mil/books/RevWar/ss/mifflin.htm |publisher=[[U.S. Army Center of Military History]] |chapter=Thomas Mifflin |pages=109–111 |date=1987 }}</ref>

In Congress, there was debate regarding whether a national army was more efficient or if individual states should maintain their own forces.  As a result of this debate the Congressional Board of War was created, on which Mifflin served from 1777 to 1778. He then rejoined the army but took little active role, following criticism of his service as quartermaster general. He was accused of embezzlement and welcomed an inquiry; however, one never took place. He resigned his commission—by then, as a major general—but Congress continued to ask his advice even after accepting his resignation.

== Political career ==

Prior to American independence, Thomas Mifflin was a member of the [[Pennsylvania Provincial Assembly]] (1772–1776). He served two terms in the [[Continental Congress]] (1774–1775 and 1782–1784), including seven months (November 1783 to June 1784) as that body's [[President of the Continental Congress|presiding officer]].

Mifflin's most important duty as president was to accept on behalf of Congress the [[George Washington's resignation as commander-in-chief|resignation of General George Washington]] on December 23, 1783. After the war, the importance of Congress declined so precipitously that Mifflin found it difficult to convince the states to send enough delegates to Congress to ratify the [[Treaty of Paris (1783)|Treaty of Paris]], which finally took place on January 14, 1784 at the Maryland State House in Annapolis.<ref name=Alexander>{{cite web |first=John K. |last=Alexander |title=Mifflin, Thomas |website=American National Biography Online |date=February 2000 }}</ref> Nonetheless, after the ratified versions of the Treaty of Paris were exchanged in France on May 12, 1784, Mifflin became the first United States president officially recognized by Great Britain.{{cn|date=March 2018}} Mifflin had just appointed Thomas Jefferson as a minister to France on May 7, 1784, and he appointed his former aide, Colonel [[Josiah Harmar]], to be the commander of the [[First American Regiment]].

After serving as president, Thomas Mifflin was a delegate to the [[United States Constitutional Convention]] in 1787.  He was a signatory to the [[Continental Association]] and the [[United States Constitution|Constitution]].<ref name=phmc/> He served in the house of [[Pennsylvania General Assembly]] (1785–1788). He was a member of the [[Supreme Executive Council of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania]], and on November 5, 1788, he was elected [[Supreme Executive Council of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania#Presidents of Council|President of the Council]], replacing [[Benjamin Franklin]]. He was unanimously reelected to the Presidency on November 11, 1789.<ref name=minutes>{{cite book |title=Minutes of the Supreme Executive Council of Pennsylvania, from its organization to the termination of the Revolution. [March 4, 1777 – December 20, 1790] |location=Harrisburg |publisher=Commonwealth of Pennsylvania |date=1852–53 }}</ref> He presided over the committee that wrote Pennsylvania's 1790 State Constitution. That document did away with the Executive Council, replacing it with a single governor.

On December 21, 1790, Mifflin became the last President of Pennsylvania and the first Governor of the Commonwealth. He held the latter office until December 17, 1799,<ref name=phmc>{{cite web |title=Thomas Mifflin |website=Pennsylvania Historical and Museum Commission |url=http://www.phmc.state.pa.us/bah/dam/governors/mifflin.asp?secid=31 |deadurl=unfit |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20011104233937/http://www.phmc.state.pa.us/bah/dam/governors/mifflin.asp?secid=31 |archivedate=2001-11-04 }}</ref> when he was succeeded by [[Thomas McKean]]. He then returned to the state legislature, where he served until his death the following month.

== Personal life ==
Although Mifflin's family had been [[Quaker]]s for four generations, he was expelled from the [[Religious Society of Friends]] upon joining the [[Continental Army]], because his involvement with a military force contradicted that faith's [[Pacifism|pacifistic]] doctrines.<ref name=adherents>{{cite web |title=Thomas Mifflin |url=http://www.adherents.com |website=[[Adherents.com]] }} Citing {{cite book |editor-first=Robert G. |editor-last=Ferris |title=Signers of the Constitution: Historic Places Commemorating the Signing of the Constitution |publisher=U.S. Department of the Interior, National Park Service |location=Washington, D.C. |edition=revised |year=1976 |pages=193–194 }}</ref>

Mifflin became a member of the [[American Philosophical Society]] in 1768, and served for two years as its secretary.<ref name=Wright/>

He served from 1773 to 1791 as a trustee of the [[College of Philadelphia|College and Academy of Philadelphia]] (now the [[University of Pennsylvania]]), including two years as treasurer (1773–1775).<ref name=Penn>{{cite web |website=Penn in the 18th Century |title=Thomas Mifflin (1744–1800) |publisher=University of Pennsylvania |url=https://www.archives.upenn.edu/people/1700s/mifflin_thos.html |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180423201059/http://www.archives.upenn.edu/people/1700s/mifflin_thos.html |archivedate=2018-04-23 }}</ref>
