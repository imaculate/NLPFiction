'''Franklin Field''' is the home of the [[Penn Relays]], and is the [[University of Pennsylvania]]'s stadium for [[American football|football]], [[track and field]], [[lacrosse]] and formerly for [[soccer]], [[field hockey]] and [[baseball]]. It is also used by Penn students for recreation, and for [[intramural]] and [[college athletics|club sports]], including [[touch football (American)|touch football]] and [[cricket]], and is the site of Penn's graduation exercises, weather permitting.

Franklin Field is located in [[Philadelphia]], at the eastern edge of Penn's campus, across the [[Schuylkill River]] from [[Center City, Philadelphia|Center City]].

Deemed by the [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]] as the oldest stadium still operating for football, it was the site of the nation's first scoreboard in 1895, the nation's first stadium with an upper deck of seats in 1922, and was the site of the first radio broadcast of a football game in 1922 on [[WTEL (AM)|WIP]] and the first television broadcast of a football game by [[KYW-TV|Philco]].<ref>http://www.pennathletics.com/page/franklin-field</ref>

From 1958 until 1970, the stadium was the home field of the [[Philadelphia Eagles]] of the [[National Football League]].

==History==
[[File:FranklinField1922.PNG|thumb|left|200px| Workmen laying bricks on south wall of Franklin Field circa 1922.]] Franklin Field was built for {{USD|100000|1895}} and dedicated on April 20, 1895, for the first running of the [[Penn Relays]]. 
The Field supplemented and eventually replaced the venue called '''University Grounds''', which was located a few blocks west on a block bounded by Spruce Street (north), 38th Street (east), Pine Street (south), Woodland Avenue and 37th Street T-intersection (northwest). Its location was typically given as "37th and Spruce".<ref>http://www.archives.upenn.edu/img/alum/blkly1894x600.jpg</ref>

Permanent Franklin Field construction did not begin until after the turn of the century. Weightman Hall gymnasium, the stadium, and permanent grandstands were designed by architect [[Frank Miles Day|Frank Miles Day & Brother]] and were erected from 1903 to 1905 at a cost of {{USD|500000|1905}}. The field was 714 feet long and 443 feet wide. The site featured a ¼-mile track, a football field, and a baseball diamond. Beneath the stands were indoor tracks and indoor training facilities.<ref>{{cite book |last=Nitzsche|first=George E.|title=University of Pennsylvania: Its History, Traditions, Buildings and Memorials|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CWYgAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA186&lpg=PA186&dq=%22Weightman+Hall%22&source=bl&ots=2ReAZ8GC-W&sig=bDzE58YjLmlHn9vWBPIGS6nO7N4&hl=en&ei=b-76SZvtJcOFtgeJn7naBQ&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=5#PPA186,M1|publisher=International Publishing Company|year=1918|location=Philadelphia|edition=Seventh |isbn=|pages=186}}</ref>

In 1916, university officials, led by George Neitzche, planned with the city to build a new 100,000-seat half-sunken stadium for $750,000 at Woodland Ravine, a depression on the southeastern side of [[The Woodlands (Philadelphia)|Woodland Cemetery]]. Plans called for a new train station called Union Station which would feature a [[Pennsylvania Railroad]] stop and a stop on a proposed (and never built) elevated subway line connected to the [[Market–Frankford Line]]. Architecture firm Koronski & Cameron created a rendering but plans quickly collapsed. Five years later, it was decided instead to expand Franklin Field.<ref>{{cite news |first= |last=|title=99 Years Ago in Philadelphia: Middle of February, 1916|date=2015-02-18|publisher=Philaphilia|url =http://philaphilia.blogspot.com/2015/02/99-years-ago-in-philadelphia-middle-of.html|accessdate=2015-03-11}}</ref>

The current stadium structure was built in the 1920s, designed by Day & Klauder, after the original wooden bleachers were torn down. The lower tier was erected in 1922. The old wood stands were razed immediately following the Penn Relays and the new concrete lower tier and seating for 50,000 were built.<ref>{{cite news |title=PENN CANNOT BE HOST.; Changes at Franklin Field Bar Track for Intercollegiates.|date=1922-01-08|work=[[New York Times]]|url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1922/01/08/107044252.pdf|pages=120|accessdate=2009-04-17 |format=PDF}}</ref> The second tier was added in 1925, again designed by [[Charles Klauder|Day & Klauder]], when it became the second (and the largest) two-tiered stadium in the United States.<ref>{{cite news |first=Mary D. |last=McConaghy|author2=Michael T.

[[File:Penn - Franklin Field - 1922.jpg|thumb|left|200px| Franklin Field upon completion in 1922.]] The first football radio broadcast originated from Franklin Field in 1922. It was carried by Philadelphia station [[WTEL (AM)|WIP]]. This claim is pre-empted by an earlier live radio broadcast emanating from Forbes Field in Pittsburgh, on October 8, 1921, a full year before Franklin Field's claim to fame. Harold W. Arlin announced the live broadcast of the Pitt-West Virginia football game on October 8, 1921, on radio station KDKA. The first commercial football television broadcast in 1939 also came from Franklin Field.<ref name=Eagles />

The [[1936 Democratic National Convention]] was concluded at Franklin Field, where President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] delivered his acceptance speech after being renominated for a second term.

In the university's football heyday—when Penn led the nation in attendance—the 65,000-seat stadium was expanded each fall with temporary stands to seat 78,000. Today, Franklin Field, named after Penn's founder, [[Benjamin Franklin]], seats 52,958.

Franklin Field switched from grass to AstroTurf in 1969. It was the first National Football League stadium to use artificial turf. The stadium's fifth AstroTurf surface was installed in 1993. The current Sprinturf field replaced the AstroTurf in 2004.<ref>{{cite news|first=Michael|last=Gertner|title=Franklin Field features new turf, scoreboard|date=2004-09-02|work=[[Daily Pennsylvanian]]|url=http://media.www.dailypennsylvanian.com/media/storage/paper882/news/2004/09/02/Sports/Franklin.Field.Features.New.Turf.Scoreboard-2151153.shtml|accessdate=2008-12-17|language=}}{{dead link|date=September 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> Franklin Field was considered a candidate to host games for the [[1994 FIFA World Cup|1994 World Cup]]. [[FIFA]] required that host stadiums have natural grass. Had Philadelphia been selected and Franklin Field used, the stadium would have had to return to a grass surface,<ref>{{cite news |title=Franklin Field May Get Grass if Phila. Gets World Cup Soccer|date=1989-07-15|work=[[Philadelphia Inquirer]] |page=D01}}</ref> or perhaps use a temporary grass field as was done at two World Cup sites—[[Giants Stadium]] in [[East Rutherford, New Jersey]], and the [[Pontiac Silverdome]] in [[Pontiac, Michigan]].

===Penn Relays===
{{details|Penn Relays}}
Franklin Field has hosted the annual [[Penn Relays|Penn Relays Carnival]], the largest track-and-field meet in the U.S., for over 100&nbsp;years.

The first Penn Relays was held in 1895. Frank B. Ellis, chairman of Penn's track committee, was looking for an event to mark the dedication of the school's then new stadium, Franklin Field. Two years earlier, during his senior year at Penn, Penn and [[Princeton University|Princeton]] competed in a one-mile relay race in which four runners from each school each ran a quarter of a mile. That race had been an outgrowth of intramural relay races held at Penn. Ellis and others arranged a series of relay races to take place on Saturday afternoon, April 20, 1895. 64 competitors from eight colleges, six prep schools and two high schools took part. Eight two-team races were run with Harvard beating Penn in the mile-relay feature in 3:34.4.<ref>{{cite news| first=| last=| title=The Relays!| date=1955-05-02| work=[[Sports Illustrated]]| url=http://vault.sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1069475/1/index.htm| pages=| accessdate=2009-01-08| language=| deadurl=yes| archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120717170006/http://vault.sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1069475/1/index.htm| archivedate=2012-07-17| df=}}</ref>

The Relays were featured in the April 29, 1961, premiere of [[ESPN on ABC|ABC]]'s ''[[Wide World of Sports (US TV series)|Wide World of Sports]]''.

===Other meets===
The 2nd [[Soviet Union|USSR]]-United States [[Track and field athletics|Track and Field]] dual meet was held at Franklin Field on July 18 and 19, 1959. Stars who competed included [[Parry O'Brien]], [[Ray Norton]], [[Al Cantello]], [[Hayes Jones]], [[Tamara Press]], [[Vasili Kuznetsov (athlete)|Vasili Kuznetsov]], [[Dyrol Burleson]], [[Greg Bell (athlete)|Greg Bell]], a young [[Wilma Rudolph]], and future long-jump great [[Igor Ter-Ovanesyan]].<ref>{{cite news | first=| last=ATF Editor| title=This Day in Track & Field: July 18–19 | date=2008-05-22| publisher=American Track & Field | url =http://www.american-trackandfield.com/read_feature/day-track-field| pages = | accessdate = 2009-01-08 | language = }}</ref>

Franklin Field hosted the [[NCAA Men's Outdoor Track and Field Championship]] in June 1961, the first time the championship was held on the [[East Coast of the United States|East Coast]]. Seven records were set, and the [[USC Trojans|University of Southern California]] won its 21st team Track & Field championship.<ref>{{cite news| first=Roy| last=Terrell| title=The Ncaa Visits The Wild East| date=1961-06-26| work=[[Sports Illustrated]]| url=http://vault.sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1072717/1/index.htm| pages=| accessdate=2009-01-08| language=| deadurl=yes| archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120718141145/http://vault.sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1072717/1/index.htm| archivedate=2012-07-18| df=}}</ref>

Following the [[Montreal]] [[1976 Summer Olympics]] and in honor of the [[United States Bicentennial]], Franklin Field hosted The Bicentennial Meet of Champions track and field event on August 4, 1976. Montreal Olympians at the meet included [[Hasely Crawford]], [[Don Quarrie]], [[Michael Shine]] and [[Edwin Moses]]. The meet was also a chance for top runners including [[Houston McTear]] who had not been able to compete in Montreal to race against medal winners.<ref>{{cite news | first=| last=[[Associated Press]]| title=Olympic medalists in Bicentennial meet| date=1976-08-04| publisher=[[The Daily Courier (Arizona)|The Prescott Courier]] | url =https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=886&dat=19760804&id=-R0LAAAAIBAJ&sjid=UFADAAAAIBAJ&pg=5888,4874152| pages = | accessdate = 2009-07-06 | language = }}</ref> 13,722 attended the event and saw [[Dwight Stones]] set a record for the high-jump and [[John Walker (athlete)|John Walker]] win the mile.<ref>{{cite news | first=Dan| last=Berger| title=Stones aims higher| date=1976-08-05| publisher=[[The Free Lance–Star]] | url =https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1298&dat=19760805&id=sQ0UAAAAIBAJ&sjid=D4sDAAAAIBAJ&pg=4826,3522960| page =8 | accessdate = 2009-07-06 | language = }}</ref>

The University of Pennsylvania hosted the two-day [[Liberty Bell Classic|1980 Liberty Bell Track and Field Classic]], an alternate to the [[1980 Summer Olympics]] for 26 countries participating in the [[1980 Summer Olympics boycott|American-led boycott of the 1980 Summer Olympics]] which were held in Moscow. The Liberty Bell Classic began on July 16, 1980. It was the largest international track meet held in the U.S. since the [[1932 Summer Olympics]] in terms of the number of foreign competitors. Franklin Field hosted the track and field events where 20,111 spectators saw the final evening of competitions. In several events, the times were better than those in Moscow, such as American [[Renaldo Nehemiah]]'s time of 13.31 in the 110m hurdles ahead of East German gold medal winner [[Thomas Munkelt]]'s time of 13.39.<ref>{{cite news| first=Craig| last=Neff| title=...and Meanwhile In Philadelphia: Half a world from Lenin Stadium, boycotting athletes, some of whom gave Olympian performances, proved there's no alternative to the Games| date=1980-07-28| work=[[Sports Illustrated]]| url=http://vault.sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1123636/index.htm| pages=| accessdate=2009-06-15| language=| deadurl=yes| archiveurl=https://archive.is/20121202235510/http://vault.sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1123636/index.htm| archivedate=2012-12-02| df=}}</ref>

===Track configuration===
The track in Franklin Field has a rarely used configuration where the 400 metre circumference is achieved in lane 5, rather than in lane one.  Thus there are two curbs on the track, inside of lane one and also inside of lane 5.  In order to accommodate the full fields of the Penn Relays and other meets, special adaptations are made with a movable curb on the backstretch to stagger the runners to arrive at a common break point in lane 5, rather than the conventional lane one.  Single lap races in the inner lanes, run portions of an extra straightaway.  Multiple lap races spend the majority of the race in lane 5 to run the proper distances.<ref>http://sites.google.com/site/collegeovalscom/ivy-league/franklin-field</ref>

The current track was installed in 2015 by [http://www.attsports.com/ ATT Sports, Inc.], and uses a Rekortan track surface.

===Penn Quakers===
Penn football played on Franklin Field for the first time in 1895. The University of Pennsylvania was one of the top football schools in the first years of college football. Many consider Penn to have been the national champion in college football in 1894, 1895, 1897 and 1904.<ref>{{cite book |title=Fight On, Pennsylvania |last=Rottenberg |first=Dan |year=1985 |publisher=Trustees of University of Pennsylvania |location=Philadelphia |pages=28, 33–34}}</ref> Other sources identify Penn as national champions in 1895, 1897, 1904 and 1908.<ref>{{cite web |title=College Football National Champions |url=http://www.collegefootballpoll.com/champions_national.html |publisher=collegefootballpoll.com |accessdate=2009-06-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110708175404/http://www.collegefootballpoll.com/champions_national.html |archivedate=2011-07-08 |df= }}</ref> [[John H.

===Philadelphia Eagles===
The [[Philadelphia Eagles]] played at Franklin Field from [[1958 NFL season|1958]] through [[1970 NFL season|1970]]. They moved to the stadium for the 1958 season after leaving [[Connie Mack Stadium]]. Franklin Field would seat over 60,000 for the Eagles whereas Connie Mack had a capacity of 39,000. According to then-Eagles president Frank L. McNamee, the Eagles did not pay rent for use of Franklin Field because Penn was a not-for-profit organization. Instead, the Eagles donated between $75,000 and $100,000 per-year to pay for maintenance and other expenses. The university collected all concessions and parking revenue.<ref name=Eagles />

On October 11, 1959, NFL Commissioner [[Bert Bell]] died after suffering a [[Myocardial infarction|heart attack]] at Franklin Field during the last two minutes of the game between the Eagles and [[Pittsburgh Steelers]].<ref>{{cite news |title=NFL History by Decade: 1950-1959|publisher=[[National Football League|NFL]] |url=http://www.nfl.com/history/chronology/1951-1960 |accessdate=2009-01-05}}</ref>

Two infamous incidents in Eagles history occurred at the stadium.

====Santa Claus booed====
During the December 15, 1968 game against the [[Minnesota Vikings]], a Christmas show was planned for halftime. The Eagles had entered the game 2–11, and fans were none too pleased with Eagles quarterback [[Norm Snead]], owner [[Jerry Wolman]], and especially coach [[Joe Kuharich]]: many fans came to the game wearing "Joe Must Go" buttons. Unfortunately, the man meant to play Santa was unable to make it to Franklin Field due to the bad weather. In lieu of the original halftime show, a 19-year-old fan named Frank Olivo (who came to the stadium already wearing a [[Santa Claus]] costume) was invited onto the field to toss candy canes with the cheerleaders. Frustrated by the team, the ugly wet weather, and his unconvincing beard, fans booed Olivo and threw snowballs at him. This incident is often referred to by sportscasters in denigrating Philadelphia sports fans as so mean they booed Santa Claus.<ref>{{cite news|first=Ronnie |last=Polaneczky |title=This is Philly: After 40 years, we'll still boo a bad Santa |date=2008-12-15 |work=[[Philadelphia Daily News]] |url=http://www.philly.com/philly/hp/news_update/20081215_Ronnie_Polaneczky__This_is_Philly__After_40_years__we_ll_still_boo_a_bad_Santa.html |accessdate=2008-12-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081216034235/http://www.philly.com/philly/hp/news_update/20081215_Ronnie_Polaneczky__This_is_Philly__After_40_years__we_ll_still_boo_a_bad_Santa.html |archivedate=December 16, 2008}}</ref> The Eagles lost the game, 24–17.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.pro-football-reference.com/boxscores/196812150phi.htm|title=Minnesota Vikings at Philadelphia Eagles – December 15, 1968|accessdate=2009-04-13 |publisher=[[Pro Football Reference]]}}</ref> (Olivo continued to attend Eagles games and even made a return as Santa Claus four decades later, at the Eagles' December 27, 2009 game against the [[Denver Broncos]] at [[Lincoln Financial Field]].)<ref>{{cite news|first=Kerith |last=Gabriel |title='Santa' recalls Eagles 1968 snowball incident |date=2009-12-28 |newspaper=Philadelphia Daily News |url=http://www.philly.com/philly/sports/20091228_Joseph_Santoliquito___Santa__recalls_Eagles_1968_snowball_incident.html |accessdate=2009-12-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091231032211/http://www.philly.com/philly/sports/20091228_Joseph_Santoliquito___Santa__recalls_Eagles_1968_snowball_incident.html |archivedate=December 31, 2009}}</ref>

====Howard Cosell taken ill====
On November 23, 1970, announcer [[Howard Cosell]] was apparently drunk during a nationally televised broadcast of the Eagles-[[New York Giants]] ''[[Monday Night Football]]'' game. After throwing up on [[color commentator]] [[Don Meredith]]'s cowboy boots shortly before halftime, Cosell left the stadium and took a taxi back to New York City. Meredith and [[play-by-play]] announcer [[Keith Jackson]] made little mention of his departure during the second half. Later, denying drunkenness, Cosell claimed that he had been dizzy from running laps around Franklin Field's track before the game with track star [[Tommie Smith]].{{Citation needed|date=September 2007}}
