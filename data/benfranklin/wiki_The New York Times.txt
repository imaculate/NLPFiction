In 1852, the newspaper started a western division, ''The Times of California'', which arrived whenever a mail boat from New York docked in California. However, the effort failed once local California newspapers came into prominence.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nytco.com/who-we-are/culture/our-history/|title=Our History {{!}} The New York Times Company|last=The New York Times Company|date=|website=www.nytco.com|publisher=|access-date=January 7, 2017}}</ref>

On September 14, 1857, the newspaper officially shortened its name to '''''The New-York Times'''''. (The hyphen in the city name was dropped on December 1, 1896.)<ref>[http://blog.nyhistory.org/it-can-hyphen-here-why-the-new-york-historical-society-includes-a-hyphen/ "It Can Hyphen Here: Why the New-York Historical Society Includes a Hyphen" » New-York Historical Society].

One of the earliest [[New York Times controversies|public controversies]] it was involved with was the [[Mortara Affair]], the subject of twenty editorials in the ''Times'' alone.<ref>Cornwell, 2004, p. 151.</ref>

The main office of ''The New York Times'' was attacked during the [[New York City Draft Riots]]. The riots, sparked by the beginning of drafting for the [[Union Army]], began on July 13, 1863. On "[[Newspaper Row (New York City)|Newspaper Row]]", across from [[New York City Hall|City Hall]], Henry Raymond stopped the rioters with [[Gatling gun]]s, early machine guns, one of which he manned himself. The mob diverted, instead attacking the headquarters of abolitionist publisher [[Horace Greeley]]'s ''[[New York Tribune]]'' until being forced to flee by the [[History of the New York City Police Department|Brooklyn City Police]], who had crossed the [[East River (New York)|East River]] to help the Manhattan authorities.<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/learning/general/onthisday/harp/0801.html On This Day: August 1, 1863] ''The New York Times''.

The newspaper's influence grew in 1870 and 1871, when it published a series of exposés on [[William Magear Tweed|William Tweed]], leader of the city's Democratic Party—popularly known as "[[Tammany Hall]]" (from its early 19th century meeting headquarters)—that led to the end of the Tweed Ring's domination of New York's City Hall.<ref>{{cite web|accessdate=September 15, 2008 |url=http://www.nytco.com/company/milestones/timeline_1851.html |title=New York Times Timeline 1851–1880 |publisher=The New York Times Company |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080914122138/http://www.nytco.com/company/milestones/timeline_1851.html |archivedate=September 14, 2008 }}</ref> Tweed had offered ''The New York Times'' five million dollars (equivalent to more than 100 million dollars today) to not publish the story.<ref name="happy 200" />

=== Ochs era ===
After George Jones died in 1891, [[Charles Ransom Miller]] and other ''New York Times'' editors raised $1{{nbsp}}million dollars to buy the ''Times'', printing it under the '''New York Times Publishing Company'''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://go.galegroup.com/ps/anonymous?id=GALE%7CCX2840800221|title=The New York Times Company|last=|first=|date=November 30, 1990|website=|publisher=Gale|access-date=January 11, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZBU7AQAAMAAJ&pg=RA4-PA8|title=Editor and Publisher|publisher=Editor & Publisher Company|year=1922|page=4}}</ref> However, the newspaper was financially crippled by the [[Panic of 1893]],<ref name="Davis1921 3" /> and by 1896, the newspaper had a circulation of less than 9,000, and was losing $1,000 a day. That year, [[Adolph Ochs]], the publisher of the ''[[Chattanooga Times]]'', gained a controlling interest in the company for $75,000.<ref name="Ochs dead">{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/learning/general/onthisday/bday/0312.html|title=Adolph S.

Shortly after assuming control of the paper, Ochs coined the paper's slogan, "All The News That's Fit To Print". The slogan has appeared in the paper since September 1896,<ref>{{cite web|last1=Jensen-Brown|first1=Peter|title=Decent and Dignified Journalism - a History of "All the News that's Fit to Print|url=http://esnpc.blogspot.com/2017/04/ecent-and-dignified-journalism-history.html|website=Early Sports 'n' Pop-Culture History Blog|accessdate=May 6, 2017|date=April 12, 2017}}</ref> and has been printed in a box in the upper left hand corner of the front page since early 1897.<ref name="nyt1881" /> The slogan was a jab at competing papers, such as [[Joseph Pulitzer]]'s ''[[New York World]]'' and [[William Randolph Hearst]]'s ''[[New York Journal]]'', which were known for a lurid, sensationalist and often inaccurate reporting of facts and opinions, described by the end of the century as "[[yellow journalism]]".<ref name="Davis1921 4">{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bws3AAAAIAAJ&pg=GBS.PA198|title=History of the New York Times, 1851-1921|publisher=''The New York Times''|year=1921|pages=274–277|author=Elmer Holmes Davis}}</ref> Under Ochs' guidance, aided by [[Carr Van Anda]], ''The New York Times'' achieved international scope, circulation, and reputation; Sunday circulation went from under 9,000 in 1896 to 780,000 in 1934.<ref name="Ochs dead" /> In 1904, during the [[Russo-Japanese War]], ''The New York Times'', along with ''[[The Times]]'', received the first on-the-spot [[wireless]] [[telegraph]] transmission from a naval battle: a report of the destruction of the [[Imperial Russian Navy|Russian Navy]]'s [[Baltic Fleet]], at the [[Battle of Port Arthur]], from the press-boat ''[[Haimun]]''.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jfNNAQAAIAAJ&pg=PA5845|title=The World's Work ...: A History of Our Time|publisher=Doubleday, Page|year=1905|pages=5844–5845}}</ref> In 1910, the first air delivery of ''The New York Times'' to [[Philadelphia]] began.<ref name="nyt1881" /> In 1919, ''The New York Times''{{'}} first trans-Atlantic delivery to London occurred by [[dirigible balloon]].

===''New York Times v. Sullivan''===
{{Main|New York Times Co. v. Sullivan}}
The paper's involvement in a 1964 libel case helped bring one of the key [[Supreme Court of the United States|United States Supreme Court]] decisions supporting [[freedom of the press]], ''[[New York Times Co. v. Sullivan]]''. In it, the United States Supreme Court established the "[[actual malice]]" standard for press reports about public officials or [[public figure]]s to be considered [[defamation|defamatory]] or [[libel]]ous. The malice standard requires the plaintiff in a defamation or libel case prove the publisher of the statement knew the statement was false or acted in [[Recklessness (law)|reckless disregard]] of its truth or falsity. Because of the high [[Legal burden of proof|burden of proof]] on the plaintiff, and difficulty in proving malicious intent, such cases by public figures rarely succeed.<ref>{{cite court|litigants=New York Times Co. v.

===The ''Pentagon Papers''===
{{Main|Pentagon Papers}}
In 1971, the ''Pentagon Papers'', a secret [[United States Department of Defense]] history of the United States' political and military involvement in the [[Vietnam War]] from 1945 to 1967, were given ("leaked") to [[Neil Sheehan]] of ''The New York Times'' by former [[State Department]] official [[Daniel Ellsberg]], with his friend [[Anthony Russo (whistleblower)|Anthony Russo]] assisting in copying them. ''The New York Times'' began publishing excerpts as a series of articles on June 13. Controversy and lawsuits followed. The papers revealed, among other things, that the government had deliberately expanded its role in the war by conducting air strikes over [[Laos]], raids along the coast of [[North Vietnam]], and offensive actions taken by [[United States Marine Corps|U.S. Marines]] well before the public was told about the actions, all while President [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] had been promising not to expand the war. The document increased the [[credibility gap]] for the U.S. government, and hurt efforts by the [[Nixon administration]] to fight the ongoing war.<ref name="nytpentagon">{{cite news|url=http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/subjects/p/pentagon_papers/index.html|title=Pentagon Papers|last=Cohen|first=Noam|work=The New York Times|accessdate=September 18, 2008}}</ref>

When ''The New York Times'' began publishing its series, President [[Richard Nixon]] became incensed. His words to National Security Advisor [[Henry Kissinger]] included "People have gotta be put to the torch for this sort of thing..." and "Let's get the son-of-a-bitch in jail."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/NSAEBB/NSAEBB48/nixon.html|title=Audio Tapes from the Nixon White House|publisher=[[National Security Archive]]|accessdate=January 20, 2009|quote=}}</ref> After failing to get ''The New York Times'' to stop publishing, [[United States Attorney General|Attorney General]] [[John N. Mitchell|John Mitchell]] and President Nixon obtained a federal court injunction that ''The New York Times'' cease publication of excerpts. The newspaper appealed and the case began working through the court system. On June 18, 1971, ''The Washington Post'' began publishing its own series. [[Ben Bagdikian]], a ''Post'' editor, had obtained portions of the papers from Ellsberg. That day the ''Post'' received a call from the Assistant Attorney General, [[William Rehnquist]], asking them to stop publishing. When the ''Post'' refused, the [[United States Department of Justice|U.S. Justice Department]] sought another injunction. The [[United States district court|U.S. District court]] judge refused, and the government appealed. On June 26, 1971, the U.S. Supreme Court agreed to take both cases, merging them into {{ussc|name=New York Times Co. v. United States |volume=403 |page=713 |year=1971}}. On June 30, 1971, the Supreme Court held in a 6–3 decision that the injunctions were unconstitutional prior restraints and that the government had not met the burden of proof required. The justices wrote nine separate opinions, disagreeing on significant substantive issues. While it was generally seen as a victory for those who claim the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] enshrines an absolute [[Freedom of speech|right to free speech]], many felt it a lukewarm victory, offering little protection for future publishers when claims of [[national security]] were at stake.<ref name="nytpentagon" />

=== 1970s and 1980s ===
In the 1970s, the paper introduced a number of new lifestyle sections including Weekend and Home, with the aim of attracting more advertisers and readers. Many criticized the move for betraying the paper's mission.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.wired.com/2017/02/new-york-times-digital-journalism/|title=How The New York Times Is Clawing Its Way into the Future|last=Snyder|first=Gabriel|date=February 2017|work=[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]|access-date=November 5, 2017|language=en-US}}</ref>

On September 7, 1976, the paper switched from an eight-column format to a six-column format. The overall page width stayed the same, with each column becoming wider.<ref name="change to six" /> On September 14, 1987, the ''Times'' printed the heaviest ever newspaper, at over {{convert|12|lb|kg}} and 1,612 pages.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/world-records/heaviest-ever-newspaper|title=Heaviest ever newspaper|newspaper=Guinness World Records|language=en-GB|access-date=February 4, 2017}}</ref>

=== 1990s and 2000s ===
In 1992, "Punch" Sulzberger stepped down as publisher; his son, [[Arthur Ochs Sulzberger Jr.]], succeeded him, first as publisher,<ref>{{Cite magazine |last=Tifft |first=Susan E. |date=July 19, 1999 |title=Scion of the Times (w/Alex S.

The ''Times'' was one of the last newspapers to adopt color photography, with the first color photograph on the front page appearing on October 16, 1997.<ref name="nyt1971" />

=== Digital era ===
[[File:NYT News Room Pulitzer speech 2009.jpg|thumb|upright|A speech in the newsroom after announcement of [[Pulitzer Prize]] winners, 2009]]{{Expand section|date=May 2017}}
''The New York Times'' switched to a digital production process sometime before 1980, but only began preserving the resulting digital text that year.<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|url=https://www.rjionline.org/stories/panel-the-future-of-the-past-modernizing-the-new-york-times-archive|title=Panel: The future of the past: Modernizing The New York Times archive|last=|first=|date=July 12, 2012|website=www.rjionline.org|publisher=Reynolds Journalism Institute|access-date=December 11, 2017}}</ref>

In September 2008, ''The New York Times'' announced that it would be combining certain sections effective October 6, 2008, in editions printed in the New York metropolitan area. The changes folded the Metro Section into the main International / National news section and combined Sports and Business (except Saturday through Monday, when Sports is still printed as a standalone section). This change also included having the name of the Metro section be called New York outside of the Tri-State Area. The presses used by ''The New York Times'' allow four sections to be printed simultaneously; as the paper had included more than four sections all days except Saturday, the sections had to be printed separately in an early press run and collated together. The changes will allow ''The New York Times'' to print in four sections Monday through Wednesday, in addition to Saturday. ''The New York Times''{{'}} announcement stated that the number of news pages and employee positions will remain unchanged, with the paper realizing cost savings by cutting overtime expenses.<ref name="Pérez-Peña, Richard" />

In 2009, the newspaper began production of local inserts in regions outside of the New York area. Beginning October 16, 2009, a two-page "Bay Area" insert was added to copies of the [[Northern California]] edition on Fridays and Sundays. The newspaper commenced production of a similar Friday and Sunday insert to the Chicago edition on November 20, 2009. The inserts consist of local news, policy, sports, and culture pieces, usually supported by local advertisements.

Following industry trends, its weekday circulation had fallen in 2009 to fewer than one million.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/10/27/business/media/27audit.html|title=U.S. Newspaper Circulation Falls 10%|author=Perez-Peña, Richard|date=October 26, 2009|work=The New York Times|authorlink=Richard Pérez-Peña}}</ref>

In August 2007, the paper reduced the physical size of its print edition, cutting the page width from {{convert|13.5|in|cm}} to a {{convert|12|in|cm}}. This followed similar moves by a roster of other newspapers in the previous ten years, including ''[[USA Today]]'', ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'', and ''[[The Washington Post]]''. The move resulted in a 5% reduction in news space, but (in an era of dwindling circulation and significant advertising revenue losses) also saved about  $12{{nbsp}}million a year.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/07/18/business/media/18web.html|title=Times to Reduce Page Size and Close a Plant in 2008|author=Seelye, Katharine Q.|date=July 18, 2006|work=The New York Times|accessdate=September 15, 2008}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://observer.com/2014/07/seinfeld-is-becoming-a-smart-phone-using-binge-watching-millennial/|title=New York Times to Cut Size 5 Percent; Keller Says Paper Better Off Smaller &#124; the ''New York Observer''|date=July 17, 2006|work=The New York Observer|accessdate=September 15, 2008}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pressgazette.co.uk/story.asp?sectioncode=1&storycode=38405&c=1|title=New York Times trims paper size to cut costs|date=August 7, 2007|work=Press Gazette|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081228002638/http://www.pressgazette.co.uk/story.asp?sectioncode=1&storycode=38405&c=1|archivedate=December 28, 2008|deadurl=yes|accessdate=September 18, 2008}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=In Tough Times, a Redesigned Journal |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/12/04/business/media/04journal.html |work=The New York Times |accessdate=September 15, 2008 |first=Katharine Q. |last=Seelye |date=December 4, 2006}}</ref>

Because of its steadily declining sales attributed to the rise of online [[alternative media]] and [[social media]], the newspaper has been going through a downsizing for several years, offering buyouts to workers and cutting expenses,<ref name="TimesCuts500">{{cite web|url=http://www.outsidethebeltway.com/archives/2005/09/new_york_times_fires_500_staffers/|title=New York Times Fires 500 Staffers|last=Joyner|first=James|publisher=Outside the Beltway|accessdate=July 4, 2006|date=September 21, 2005}}</ref> in common with a general trend among print news media.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/26/business/media/new-york-times-co-to-offer-buyouts-to-employees.html|title=New York Times Co. to Offer Buyouts to Employees|date=May 25, 2016|work=The New York Times|accessdate=May 25, 2016}}</ref>

In 2016, reporters for the newspaper were reportedly the target of cyber security breaches. The [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] was reportedly investigating the attacks.

In October 2018, the ''Times'' published a 14,218-word investigation into [[Donald Trump]]'s "self-made" fortune and alleged tax fraud, an 18-month project based on examination of 100,000 pages of documents.

===Discrimination in employment===
[[Employment discrimination|Discriminatory]] practices restricting women in editorial positions were previously employed by the paper. The newspaper's first general woman reporter was [[Jane Grant]], who described her experience afterwards. She wrote, "In the beginning I was charged not to reveal the fact that a female had been hired". Other reporters nicknamed her Fluff and she was subjected to considerable [[hazing]]. Because of her [[Sex and gender distinction|gender]], promotions were out of the question, according to the then-managing editor. She was there for fifteen years, interrupted by World War I.<ref>Grant, Jane, ''Confession of a Feminist'', in ''[[The American Mercury]]'', vol. LVII, no. 240, Dec. 1943 (microfilm), pp. 684–691, esp. pp. 684–686.</ref>

In 1935, [[Anne McCormick]] wrote to [[Arthur Hays Sulzberger]], "I hope you won't expect me to revert to 'woman's-point-of-view' stuff."<ref>Robertson, Nan, ''The Girls in the Balcony: Women, Men, and ''The New York Times (N.Y.: Random House, [2nd printing?] 1992 ({{ISBN|0-394-58452-X}})), p. 35.</ref> Later, she interviewed major political leaders and appears to have had easier access than her colleagues did. Even those who witnessed her in action were unable to explain how she got the interviews she did.<ref>Robertson, Nan, ''The Girls in the Balcony'', p. 27.</ref> [[Clifton Daniel]] said, "[After World War II,] I'm sure [[Konrad Adenauer|Adenauer]] called her up and invited her to lunch. She never had to grovel for an appointment."<ref>Robertson, Nan, ''The Girls in the Balcony'', p. 28.</ref> Covering world leaders' speeches after [[World War II]] at the [[National Press Club (USA)|National Press Club]] was limited to men by a Club rule. When women were eventually allowed in to hear the speeches, they still were not allowed to ask the speakers questions, although men were allowed and did ask, even though some of the women had won Pulitzer Prizes for prior work.<ref>Robertson, Nan, ''The Girls in the Balcony'', pp. 100–101.</ref> ''Times'' reporter Maggie Hunter refused to return to the Club after covering one speech on assignment.<ref>Robertson, Nan, ''The Girls in the Balcony'', pp. 101–102.</ref> [[Nan C. Robertson|Nan Robertson]]'s article on the [[Union Stock Yards]], [[Chicago]], was read aloud as anonymous by a professor, who then said, "'It will come as a surprise to you, perhaps, that the reporter is a ''girl,''{{'}} he began... [G]asps; amazement in the ranks. 'She had used all her senses, not just her eyes, to convey the smell and feel of the stockyards. She chose a difficult subject, an offensive subject. Her imagery was strong enough to revolt you.'"<ref>Robertson, Nan, ''The Girls in the Balcony'', p. 76 (italics in original).</ref> ''The New York Times'' hired Kathleen McLaughlin after ten years at the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'', where "[s]he did a series on maids, going out herself to apply for housekeeping jobs."<ref>Robertson, Nan, ''The Girls in the Balcony'', p. 61.</ref>

=== Slogan ===
''The New York Times'' has had one slogan. Since 1896, the newspaper's slogan has been "All the News That's Fit to Print." In 1896, [[Adolph Ochs]] held a competition to attempt to find a replacement slogan, offering a $100 prize for the best one. Entries included "News, Not Nausea"; "In One Word: Adequate"; "News Without Noise"; "Out Heralds [[The New York Herald|The Herald]], Informs [[New York World|The World]], and Extinguishes [[The Sun (New York City)|The Sun]]"; "The Public Press is a Public Trust"; and the winner of the competition, "All the world's news, but not a school for scandal."<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/05/insider/1896-news-not-nausea.html|title=1896 {{!}} ‘News, Not Nausea’|last=Dunlap|first=David W.|date=January 5, 2017|work=The New York Times|access-date=March 14, 2017|issn=0362-4331}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-16918787|title=Story of the most famous seven words in US journalism|last=Campbell|first=Professor W.

=== Ochs-Sulzberger family ===
In 1896, Adolph Ochs bought ''The New York Times'', a money-losing newspaper, and formed the New York Times Company. The Ochs-Sulzberger family, one of the United States' newspaper dynasties, has owned ''The New York Times'' ever since.<ref name="nyt1881" /> The publisher [[Initial public offering|went public]] on January 14, 1969, trading at $42 a share on the [[American Stock Exchange LLC|American Stock Exchange]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.nysl.nysed.gov/nysnp/nytlucey.htm|title=The New York Times: A Chronology: 1851-2010|last=Lucey|first=Bill|date=|website=New York State Library|access-date=}}</ref> After this, the family continued to exert control through its ownership of the vast majority of Class B [[Voting interest|voting shares]]. Class A shareholders are permitted restrictive voting rights while Class B shareholders are allowed open voting rights.

The Ochs-Sulzberger family trust controls roughly 88 percent of the company's class B shares. Any alteration to the dual-class structure must be ratified by six of eight directors who sit on the board of the Ochs-Sulzberger family trust. The Trust board members are Daniel H. Cohen, James M. Cohen, Lynn G. Dolnick, Susan W. Dryfoos, Michael Golden, Eric M. A. Lax, Arthur O. Sulzberger Jr., and Cathy J. Sulzberger.<ref>{{cite news|title=How a Money Manager Battled New York Times |work=The Wall Street Journal |date=March 21, 2007 |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB117441975619343135 |accessdate=September 16, 2008 |first=Sarah |last=Ellison |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070328181845/http://online.wsj.com/public/article/SB117441975619343135-nb3xaCqDA7AjGYGGjWb0pkAVzt8_20080320.html |archivedate=March 28, 2007 |df= }}</ref>

[[Turner Catledge]], the top editor at ''The New York Times'' from 1952 to 1968, wanted to hide the ownership influence. Arthur Sulzberger routinely wrote memos to his editor, each containing suggestions, instructions, complaints, and orders. When Catledge would receive these memos he would erase the publisher's identity before passing them to his subordinates. Catledge thought that if he removed the publisher's name from the memos it would protect reporters from feeling pressured by the owner.<ref>Chomsky, Daniel(2006) {{"'}}An Interested Reader': Measuring Ownership Control at the New York Times", ''Critical Studies in Media Communication'', 23(1): 1–18</ref>

===Public editors===

==Content==
===Style===
When referring to people, ''The New York Times'' generally uses [[honorific]]s, rather than unadorned last names (except in the sports pages, Book Review and Magazine).<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://publiceditor.blogs.nytimes.com/2007/07/25/a-question-of-honorifics/|title=A Question of Honorifics|last=Hoyt|first=Clark|date=|work=|newspaper=New York Times-Public Editor's Journal|language=en|access-date=January 26, 2017|via=}}</ref>

In August 2014, the ''Times'' decided to use the word "[[torture]]" to describe incidents in which interrogators "inflicted pain on a prisoner in an effort to get information." This was a shift from the paper's previous practice of describe such practices as "harsh" or "brutal" interrogations.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Byers|first1=Dylan|title=N.Y.

''Times'' politics editor Carolyn Ryan said: "It's a rare thing for us to use this language in our stories, even in quotes, and we discussed it at length," ultimately deciding to publish it because of its news value and because "[t]o leave it out or simply describe it seemed awkward and less than forthright to us, especially given that we would be running a video that showed our readers exactly what was said."<ref>[[Hadas Gold]], [https://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/31/opinion/the-case-for-profanity-in-print.html?_r=0 New York Times, CNN report Trump's vulgarities in full: Media grapple with whether to use offensive terms in unaltered state], ''Politico'' (October 7, 2016).</ref>

=== International print edition ===
''[[The New York Times International Edition]]'' is a print version of the paper tailored for readers outside the United States. Formerly a joint venture with ''[[The Washington Post]]'' named ''The International Herald Tribune'', ''The New York Times'' took full ownership of the paper in 2002 and has gradually integrated it more closely into its domestic operations.

Falling print advertising revenue and projections of continued decline resulted in a "metered [[paywall]]" being instituted in 2011, regarded as modestly successful after garnering several hundred thousand subscriptions and about $100{{nbsp}}million in revenue {{as of|2012|03|lc=y}}.<ref name="MDMMar12">{{cite news|title='NYT' Pay Wall Could Bring $100M Annually|url=http://www.mediapost.com/publications/article/169998/nyt-pay-wall-could-bring-100m-annually.html|accessdate=March 13, 2012|newspaper=Media Daily News|date=March 12, 2012|author= Sass, Erik}}</ref><ref name=":1">{{Cite web|url=https://www.mediapost.com/publications/article/310971/new-york-times-tightens-metered-paywall.html|title='New York Times' Tightens Metered Paywall|last=Guaglione|first=Sara|date=December 1, 2017|website=MediaPost|access-date=December 11, 2017}}</ref> As announced in March 2011, the paywall would charge frequent readers for access to its online content.<ref name="NYT20110317">{{cite news |title=A Letter to Our Readers About Digital Subscriptions |last=Sulzberger|first=Arthur Ochs Jr. |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/03/18/opinion/l18times.html |date=March 17, 2011 |work=The New York Times |accessdate=March 17, 2011}}</ref> Readers would be able to access up to 20 articles each month without charge.

This plan would allow free access for occasional readers, but produce revenue from "heavy" readers. Digital subscriptions rates for four weeks range from $15 to $35 depending on the package selected, with periodic new subscriber promotions offering four-week all-digital access for as low as 99¢. Subscribers to the paper's print edition get full access without any additional fee.

The newspaper's website was hacked on August 29, 2013, by the [[Syrian Electronic Army]], a hacking group that supports the government of Syrian President [[Bashar al-Assad]].

===Spanish-language version===
In February 2016, ''The New York Times'' launched a [[Spanish language]] edition, ''The New York Times en Español''. The Spanish language version features increased coverage of news and events in [[Latin America]] and [[Spain]]. The expansion into Spanish language news content allows the newspaper to expand its audience into the [[Spanish speaking world]] and increase its revenue. The Spanish language version was seen as a way to compete with the established [[El País]] newspaper of [[Spain]], which bills itself the "global newspaper in Spanish".<ref>García, Mario R.

==Criticism and controversies==
{{Main|New York Times controversies}}

===Failure to report famine in Ukraine===
''The New York Times'' was criticized for the work of reporter [[Walter Duranty]], who served as its Moscow bureau chief from 1922 through 1936. Duranty wrote a series of stories in 1931 on the [[Soviet Union]] and won a Pulitzer Prize for his work at that time; however, he has been criticized for his denial of widespread famine, most particularly the [[Holodomor|Ukrainian famine]] in the 1930s.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=ZXLhwVJvfXMC&pg=PA573&dq=The+food+shortage+which+has+affected+almost+the+whole+population+in+the+last+year,+and+particularly+in+the+grain-producing+provinces#v=onepage&q=The%20food%20shortage%20which%20has%20affected%20almost%20the%20whole%20population%20in%20the%20last%20year%2C%20and%20particularly%20in%20the%20grain-producing%20provinces&f=false |title=Assignment in Utopia |last=Lyons |first=Eugene |publisher=Greenwood Press Reprint |accessdate= April 23, 2012|isbn=9781412817608 |year=1938 }}</ref><ref name="ConqRav">Conquest, R. <u>Reflections on a Ravaged Century</u>.

Von Hagen found Duranty's reports to be unbalanced and uncritical, and that they far too often gave voice to [[Stalinism|Stalinist]] [[propaganda]]. In comments to the press he stated, "For the sake of The New York Times' honor, they should take the prize away."<ref>[https://www.usatoday.com/news/nation/2003-10-22-ny-times-pulitzer_x.htm "N.Y.

===World War II===
On November 14, 2001, in ''The New York Times''{{'}} 150th anniversary issue, former executive editor [[Max Frankel]] wrote that before and during World War II, the ''Times'' had maintained a consistent policy to minimize reports on [[the Holocaust]] in their news pages.<ref name="frankel">{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2001/11/14/specials/onefifty/20FRAN.html|title=Turning Away From the Holocaust|author=Max Frankel|date=November 14, 2001|work=The New York Times|authorlink=Max Frankel}}</ref> [[Laurel Leff]], associate professor of journalism at [[Northeastern University]], concluded that the newspaper had downplayed the [[Nazi Germany|Third Reich]] targeting of [[Jew]]s for [[Holocaust|genocide]]. Her 2005 book ''[[Buried by the Times]]'' documents the paper's tendency before, during and after World War II to place deep inside its daily editions the news stories about the ongoing persecution and extermination of Jews, while obscuring in those stories the special impact of the Nazis' crimes on Jews in particular. Leff attributes this dearth in part to the complex personal and political views of the newspaper's Jewish publisher, [[Arthur Hays Sulzberger]], concerning [[Jewishness]], [[antisemitism]], and [[Zionism]].<ref>{{cite book|title=Buried by the Times: The Holocaust and America's Most Important Newspaper|last=Leff|first=Laurel|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2005|isbn=978-0-521-81287-0|location=New York}}</ref>

===Delayed publication of 2005 NSA warrantless surveillance story===
''The New York Times'' was criticized for the 13-month delay of the December 2005 story revealing the U.S. [[National Security Agency]] [[NSA warrantless surveillance (2001–07)|warrantless surveillance program]].<ref>{{cite news|last1=Grieve|first1=Tim|title=What the Times knew, and when it knew it|url=http://www.salon.com/2006/08/14/times_24/|accessdate=July 26, 2014|agency=Salon|date=August 14, 2006}}</ref> Ex-NSA officials blew the whistle on the program to journalists [[James Risen]] and [[Eric Lichtblau]], who presented an investigative article to the newspaper in November 2004, weeks before America's [[2004 Presidential Election (United States)|presidential election]].

Former ''The New York Times'' executive editor [[Bill Keller]] decided not to report the piece after being pressured by the Bush administration and being advised not to do so by ''New York Times'' Washington bureau chief [[Philip Taubman]]. Keller explained the silence's rationale in an interview with the newspaper in 2013, stating "Three years after 9/11, we, as a country, were still under the influence of that trauma, and we, as a newspaper, were not immune".<ref>{{cite news|last1=Sullivan|first1=Margaret|title=Lessons in a Surveillance Drama Redux|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/10/public-editor/sullivan-lessons-in-a-surveillance-drama-redux.html?pagewanted=all&_r=0|accessdate=July 18, 2014|agency=The New York Times|date=November 9, 2013}}</ref>

In 2014, ''[[PBS Frontline]]'' interviewed Risen and Lichtblau, who said that the newspaper's plan was to not publish the story at all. "The editors were furious at me", Risen said to the program. "They thought I was being insubordinate." Risen wrote a book about the mass surveillance revelations after ''The New York Times'' declined the piece's publication, and only released it after Risen told them that he would publish the book. Another reporter told [[NPR]] that the newspaper "avoided disaster" by ultimately publishing the story.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Folkenflik|first1=David|title='New York Times' Editor: Losing Snowden Scoop 'Really Painful'|url=https://www.npr.org/2014/06/05/319233332/new-york-times-editor-losing-snowden-scoop-really-painful|accessdate=July 18, 2014|agency=NPR|date=June 5, 2014}}</ref>

===Irish student controversy===
On June 16, 2015, ''The New York Times'' published an article reporting the deaths of six Irish students staying in [[Berkeley, California|Berkeley]], [[California]] when the balcony they were standing on collapsed, the paper's story insinuating that they were to blame for the collapse.

===Iran===
A 2015 study found that ''The New York Times'' fed into an overarching tendency towards national bias. During the [[Nuclear program of Iran|Iranian nuclear crisis]] the newspaper minimized the "negative processes" of the United States while overemphasizing similar processes of Iran. This tendency was shared by other papers such as ''[[The Guardian]]'', ''[[Tehran Times]]'', and the [[Fars News Agency]], while [[Xinhua News Agency]] was found to be more neutral while at the same time mimicking the foreign policy of the [[People's Republic of China]].<ref>Jesse Hearns-Branaman.

In April 2016, two black female employees in their sixties filed a federal class action lawsuit against The New York Times Company CEO [[Mark Thompson (media executive)|Mark Thompson]] and chief revenue officer Meredith Levien, claiming [[age discrimination|age]], [[Gender discrimination|gender]], and [[racial discrimination]].

===Accusations of bias===
''The New York Times'' [[public editor]] ([[ombudsman]]) Elizabeth Spayd wrote in 2016 that "Conservatives and even many moderates, see in The Times a [[Red states and blue states|blue-state]] worldview" and accuse it of harboring a liberal bias. Spayd did not analyze the substance of the claim, but did opine that the ''Times'' is "part of a fracturing media environment that reflects a fractured country. That in turn leads liberals and conservatives toward separate news sources."<ref name="SpaydLiberal">{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/24/public-editor/liz-spayd-the-new-york-times-public-editor.html|title=Why Readers See The Times as Liberal|last=Spayd|first=Liz|date=July 23, 2016|work=The New York Times|access-date=February 28, 2017|issn=0362-4331}}</ref> ''Times'' executive editor [[Dean Baquet]] stated that he does not believe coverage has a liberal bias, but that: "We have to be really careful that people feel like they can see themselves in ''The New York Times''. I want us to be perceived as fair and honest to the world, not just a segment of it. It's a really difficult goal. Do we pull it off all the time? No."<ref name="SpaydLiberal" />

''Times'' public editor [[Arthur Brisbane]] wrote in 2012: "When The Times covers a national presidential campaign, I have found that the lead editors and reporters are disciplined about enforcing fairness and balance, and usually succeed in doing so. Across the paper's many departments, though, so many share a kind of political and cultural progressivism — for lack of a better term — that this worldview virtually bleeds through the fabric of The Times."<ref>Brisbane Arthur S., (August 25, 2012) [https://www.nytimes.com/2012/08/26/opinion/sunday/success-and-risk-as-the-times-transforms.html Success and Risk as The Times Transforms].</ref>

In mid-2004, the newspaper's then-public editor [[Daniel Okrent]], wrote an [[opinion piece]] in which he said that ''The New York Times'' did have a liberal bias in news coverage of certain social issues such as abortion and [[same-sex marriage]]. He stated that this bias reflected the paper's [[cosmopolitanism]], which arose naturally from its roots as a hometown paper of New York City.<ref name="is it liberal?" /> He wrote, "if you're examining the paper's coverage of these subjects from a perspective that is neither urban nor Northeastern nor culturally seen-it-all; if you are among the groups The Times treats as strange objects to be examined on a laboratory slide (devout Catholics, gun owners, Orthodox Jews, Texans); if your value system wouldn't wear well on a composite New York Times journalist, then a walk through this paper can make you feel you're traveling in a strange and forbidding world."<ref name="is it liberal?" /> Okrent wrote that the ''Time''{{'}}s Arts & Leisure; the Sunday ''Times Magazine'', and Culture coverage trend to the left.<ref>Okrent Daniel, (July 25, 2004) [https://www.nytimes.com/2004/07/25/opinion/the-public-editor-is-the-new-york-times-a-liberal-newspaper.html|THE PUBLIC EDITOR; Is The New York Times a Liberal Newspaper?] (NYT article).</ref>

Nevertheless, like many other U.S. media sources, the ''Times'' had suffered from a decline in public perceptions of credibility in the U.S. from 2004 to 2012.<ref name="Pew">{{Cite web|url=http://www.people-press.org/2012/08/16/further-decline-in-credibility-ratings-for-most-news-organizations/|title=Further Decline in Credibility Ratings for Most News Organizations|publisher=Pew Research Center for the People and the Press|date=August 16, 2012}}</ref> A [[Pew Research Center]] survey in 2012 asked respondents about their views on credibility of various news organizations.

A large percentage (19%) of respondents were unable to rate believability. The ''Times''{{'}}s score was comparable to that of ''[[USA Today]]''.<ref name="Pew" /> Media analyst [[Brooke Gladstone]] of WNYC's ''[[On the Media]]'', writing for ''The New York Times'', says that the decline in U.S. public trust of the mass media can be explained (1) by the rise of the polarized Internet-driven news; (2) by a decline in trust in U.S. institutions more generally; and (3) by the fact that "Americans say they want accuracy and impartiality, but the polls suggest that, actually, most of us are seeking affirmation."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/roomfordebate/2015/11/11/why-has-trust-in-the-news-media-declined/trust-in-the-news-media-has-come-to-mean-affirmation|author=Brooke Gladstone|title='Trust' in the News Media Has Come to Mean Affirmation|publisher=''The New York Times''|date=December 21, 2015}}</ref>
