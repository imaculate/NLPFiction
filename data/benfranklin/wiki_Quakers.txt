The first Quakers lived in mid-17th-century England. The movement arose from the [[Legatine-Arians]] and other [[English Dissenters|dissenting Protestant groups]], breaking away from the [[Established church|established]] [[Church of England]]. The Quakers, especially the ones known as the [[Valiant Sixty]], attempted to convert others to their understanding of Christianity, travelling both throughout Great Britain and overseas, preaching the [[gospel of Jesus Christ]].

===Beginnings in England===
{{see also|Britain Yearly Meeting#History}}
[[File:Fox by Lely 2.jpg|thumb|upright|[[George Fox]], an early Quaker]]
During and after the [[English Civil War]] (1642–1651) many [[English Dissenters|dissenting Christian groups]] emerged, including the [[Seekers]] and others. A young man, [[George Fox]], was dissatisfied with the teachings of the [[Church of England]] and non-conformists. He had a revelation that "there is one, even, Christ Jesus, who can speak to thy condition",<ref name=GeorgeFoxsJournal/> and became convinced that it was possible to have a direct experience of Christ without the aid of an ordained clergy. In 1652 he had a [[vision (spirituality)|vision]] on [[Pendle Hill]] in Lancashire, England, in which he believed that "the Lord let me see in what places he had a great people to be gathered".<ref name=GeorgeFoxsJournal/> Following this he travelled around England, the Netherlands,<ref name="Netherlands">{{cite journal|last=Nuttall|first=Geoffrey|title=Early Quakerism in the Netherlands: Its wider context|journal=The Bulletin of the Friends Historical Association|year=1955|volume=44|issue=1|pages=3–18|url=http://muse.jhu.edu/login?auth=0&type=summary&url=/journals/quaker_history/v044/44.1.nuttall.pdf|jstor=41944566|access-date=21 November 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131016102656/http://muse.jhu.edu/login?auth=0&type=summary&url=%2Fjournals%2Fquaker_history%2Fv044%2F44.1.nuttall.pdf|archive-date=16 October 2013|dead-url=yes}}</ref> and [[Barbados]]<ref name=Barbados>{{cite book|last=Gragg|first=Larry|title=The Quaker community on Barbados : challenging the culture of the planter class|year=2009|publisher=University of Missouri Press |location=Columbia |isbn=9780826218476 |url=https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Quaker_Community_on_Barbados.html |edition=[Online-Ausg.]}}</ref> preaching and teaching with the aim of converting new adherents to his faith. The central theme of his Gospel message was that Christ has come to teach his people himself.<ref name=GeorgeFoxsJournal/> His followers considered themselves to be the restoration of the true Christian church, after centuries of apostasy in the churches in England.

In 1650, Fox was brought before the [[Magistrates of England and Wales|magistrates]] [[Gervase Bennet]] and Nathaniel Barton, on a charge of religious [[blasphemy]]. According to Fox's autobiography, Bennet "was the first that called us Quakers, because I bade them tremble at the word of the Lord".<ref name=GeorgeFoxsJournal/>{{rp|125}} It is thought that Fox was referring to {{Bibleverse|Isaiah|66:2|AKJV}} or {{Bibleverse|Ezra|9:4|AKJV}}. Thus, the name ''Quaker'' began as a way of ridiculing Fox's admonition, but became widely accepted and is used by some Quakers.<ref>{{cite book |author=Margery Post Abbott |title=Historical dictionary of the Friends (Quakers) |year=2003 |page=xxxi|display-authors=etal}}</ref> Quakers also described themselves using terms such as true Christianity, Saints, Children of the Light, and Friends of the Truth, reflecting terms used in the New Testament by members of the early Christian church.

Quakerism gained a considerable following in England and Wales, and the numbers increased to a peak of 60,000 in England and Wales by 1680<ref name=PopulationHistory>{{cite book |title=The population history of England, 1541–1871: a reconstruction |last1=Wrigley|first1=Edward Anthony|last2=Schofield|first2=Roger|last3=Schofield|first3=R.

This was relaxed after the [[Declaration of Indulgence]] (1687–88) and stopped under the [[Act of Toleration 1689]].

One modern view of Quakerism at this time was that the relationship with Christ was encouraged through spiritualisation of human relations, and "the redefinition of the Quakers as a holy tribe, 'the family and household of God{{Single double}}.<ref name="Levy 13">{{cite book|last=Levy|first=Barry|title=Quakers and the American Family|pages=13}}</ref> Together with [[Margaret Fell]], the wife of [[Thomas Fell]], who was the vice-chancellor of the [[Duchy of Lancaster]] and an eminent judge, Fox developed new conceptions of family and community that emphasised "holy conversation": speech and behaviour that reflected piety, faith, and love.<ref>{{cite book|last=Levy|first=Barry|title=Quakers and the American Family|pages=53, 130}}</ref> With the restructuring of the family and household came new roles for women; Fox and Fell viewed the Quaker mother as essential to developing "holy conversation" in her children and husband.<ref name="Levy 13"/> Quaker women were also responsible for the spirituality of the larger community, coming together in "meetings" that regulated marriage and domestic behaviour.<ref name="Levy 78">{{cite book|last=Levy|first=Barry|title=Quakers and the American Family|pages=78}}</ref>

===Immigration into North America===

{{see also|History of the Quakers#William Penn and settlement in colonial Pennsylvania}}
[[File:Mary dyer being led.jpg|thumb|Quaker [[Mary Dyer]] led to execution on [[Boston Common]], 1 June 1660]]
[[File:William Penn at 22 1666.jpg|thumb|right|William Penn, the founder of Pennsylvania, as a young man]]

The persecution of Quakers in North America began in 1656 when English Quaker missionaries [[Mary Fisher (missionary)|Mary Fisher]] and [[Ann Austin]] began preaching in Boston. They were considered heretics because of their insistence on individual obedience to the [[Inner light]]. They were imprisoned and banished by the [[Massachusetts Bay Colony]]. Their books were burned, and most of their property confiscated. They were imprisoned in terrible conditions, then deported.<ref>Edward Digby Baltzell, ''Puritan Boston and Quaker Philadelphia'' (1996) p.86</ref>

In 1660, English Quaker [[Mary Dyer]] was hanged on [[Boston Common]] for repeatedly defying a [[Puritan]] law banning Quakers from the colony.<ref>Rogers, Horatio, 2009. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=L5_5yIgpa-YC&printsec=frontcover&dq=mary+dyer+1660&hl=en&ei=8p99TMePDpGO4QayguXHBg&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1&ved=0CCsQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=Among%20the%20most%20pathetic%20chapters%20&f=false Mary Dyer of Rhode Island: The Quaker Martyr That Was Hanged on Boston]'' pp.1–2.

Some Friends immigrated to what is now the Northeastern region of the United States in the early 1680s in search of economic opportunities and a more tolerant environment in which to build communities of "holy conversation".<ref>{{cite book|last=Levy|first=Barry|title=Quakers and the American Family|pages=113}}</ref> They were able to establish thriving communities in the [[Delaware Valley]], although they continued to experience persecution in some areas, such as New England. The three colonies that tolerated Quakers at this time were [[West Jersey]], [[Colony of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations|Rhode Island]], and [[Province of Pennsylvania|Pennsylvania]], where Quakers established themselves politically. In Rhode Island, 36 governors in the first 100 years were Quakers. West Jersey and Pennsylvania were established by affluent Quaker [[William Penn]] in 1676 and 1682 respectively, with Pennsylvania as an American commonwealth run under Quaker principles. William Penn signed a peace treaty with [[Tamanend|Tammany]], leader of the Delaware tribe,<ref>{{cite book|author=David Yount|year=2007|url=https://books.google.com/?id=pk7ycUq3cxsC&pg=PA82&dq#v=onepage&q=&f=false |title=How the Quakers invented America|publisher=Rowman & Littlefield|page=82 |isbn=0-7425-5833-9}}</ref> and other treaties followed between Quakers and Native Americans.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/christianity/subdivisions/quakers_1.shtml|title=BBC – Religions – Christianity: Quakers|access-date=13 June 2017}}</ref> This peace endured almost a century, until the [[Penn's Creek Massacre]] of 1755.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.penntreatymuseum.org/treaty.php|title=Penn Treaty Museum}}</ref> Early colonial Quakers also established communities and meeting houses in North Carolina and Maryland, after fleeing persecution by the Anglican Church in Virginia.<ref>"[http://articles.dailypress.com/1989-01-15/news/8901100018_1_quakers-colonial-virginia-colonial-anglican-church Quakers Often Fled Virginia", Rowlings, Virginia, ''Daily Press''], 15 January 1989</ref>

In a 2007 interview, author David Yount (''How the Quakers Invented America'') said that Quakers first introduced many ideas that later became mainstream, such as democracy in the Pennsylvania legislature, the [[United States Bill of Rights|Bill of Rights]] to the [[United States Constitution|U.S. Constitution]] from Rhode Island Quakers, trial by jury, equal rights for men and women, and public education. Even the Liberty Bell itself was cast by Quakers.<ref>[https://www.c-span.org/video/?202202-17/quakers-invented-america How the Quakers Invented America], an approximately five-minute interview of David Yount by Peter Slen, C-SPAN, 1 November 2007.</ref>

===Quietism===
{{also|Quietism (Christian philosophy)}}

Early Quakerism tolerated boisterous behaviour that challenged conventional etiquette, but by 1700, they no longer supported disruptive and unruly behaviour.<ref>{{cite book|last=Levy|first=Barry|title=Quakers and the American Family|pages=58}}</ref> During the 18th century, Quakers entered the ''Quietist'' period in the history of their church, becoming more inward-looking spiritually and less active in converting others. Marrying outside the Society was outlawed. Numbers dwindled, dropping to 19,800 in England and Wales by 1800 (0.21% of population),<ref name="PopulationHistory"/> and 13,859 by 1860 (0.07% of population).<ref name=PopulationHistory/> The formal name "Religious Society of Friends" dates from this period and was probably derived from the appellations "Friends of the Light" and "Friends of the Truth".{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}<!-- Woolman and others used the term "Friends" much earlier -->

===Splits===
In the 19th century, there was a diversification of theological beliefs in the Religious Society of Friends, and this led to several large splits within the Quaker movement.

====Hicksite–Orthodox split====
The Hicksite–Orthodox split arose out of both ideological and socioeconomic tensions. Philadelphia Yearly Meeting Hicksites tended to be agrarian and poorer than the more urban, wealthier, Orthodox Quakers. With increasing financial success, Orthodox Quakers wanted to "make the Society a more respectable body—to transform their sect into a church—by adopting mainstream Protestant orthodoxy".<ref>{{cite book|last=Crothers|first=Glenn|title=Quakers Living in the Lion's Mouth: The Society of Friends in Northern Virginia, 1730–1865|year=2012|publisher=University Press of Florida|location=Gainesville|pages=145}}</ref> Hicksites, though they held a variety of views, generally saw the market economy as corrupting, and believed Orthodox Quakers had sacrificed their orthodox Christian spirituality for material success. Hicksites viewed the Bible as secondary to the individual cultivation of God's light within.<ref>{{cite book|last=Crothers|first=Glenn|title=Quakers Living in the Lion's Mouth|pages=145}}</ref>

With Gurneyite Quakers' shift toward Protestant principles and away from the spiritualisation of human relations, women's role as promoters of "holy conversation" started to decrease. Conversely, within the Hicksite movement the rejection of the market economy and the continuing focus on community and family bonds tended to encourage women to retain their role as powerful arbiters.

[[Elias Hicks]]' religious views were claimed to be [[universalist]] and to contradict Quakers' historical orthodox Christian beliefs and practices. Hicks' Gospel preaching and teaching precipitated the ''Great Separation'' of 1827, which resulted in a parallel system of Yearly Meetings in America, joined by Friends from Philadelphia, New York, Ohio, Indiana, and Baltimore. They were referred to by their opponents as ''Hicksites'' and by others, and sometimes themselves, as ''orthodox''. Quakers in Great Britain recognised only the ''Orthodox'' Quakers and refused to correspond with the ''Hicksites.''

====Beaconite controversy====
[[Isaac Crewdson]] was a [[Recorded Minister]] in [[Manchester]], UK. His 1835 book ''A Beacon to the Society of Friends'' strongly argued that the inner light could not exist alongside a religious belief in [[Salvation (Christianity)|salvation]] by the [[Atonement in Christianity|atonement]] of Christ.<ref name=Bebbington>{{cite book|last=Bebbington|first=David William|title=Evangelicalism in modern Britain: a history from the 1730s to the 1980s|year=1989|publisher=Unwin Hyman Ltd|location=London |isbn=0-415-10464-5}}</ref>{{rp|page=155}} This Christian controversy led to Crewdson's resignation from the Religious Society of Friends, along with 48 fellow members of Manchester Meeting and about 250 other British Quakers in 1836–37. Some of these joined the [[Plymouth Brethren]] Church.

====Rise of Gurneyite Quakerism, and the Gurneyite–Conservative split====
[[File:Joseph John Gurney.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Joseph John Gurney]] was a prominent 19th century British Friend and a strong proponent of evangelical views]]
''Orthodox'' Friends became more [[evangelicalism|evangelical]] during the 19th century<ref>{{cite journal|last=Bronner|first=Edwin B.|title=Moderates in London Yearly Meeting, 1857–1873: Precursors of Quaker Liberals|journal=Church History|year=1990|volume=59|issue=3|pages=356–371|doi=10.2307/3167744|jstor=3167744}}</ref> and were influenced by the [[Second Great Awakening]]. This movement was led by British Quaker [[Joseph John Gurney]]. Christian Friends held [[Revival meeting]]s in America and became involved in the [[Holiness movement]] of churches. Quakers such as [[Hannah Whitall Smith]] and [[Robert Pearsall Smith]] became speakers in the religious movement and introduced Quaker phrases and practices to it.<ref name=Bebbington />{{rp|page=157}} British Friends became involved with the [[Higher Life movement]], with Robert Wilson from [[Cockermouth]] meeting founding the [[Keswick Convention]].<ref name=Bebbington />{{rp|page=157}} From the 1870s it became commonplace in Great Britain to have ''home mission meetings'' on a Sunday evening with Christian hymns and a Bible-based sermon alongside the silent meetings for worship on Sunday morning.<ref name=Bebbington />{{rp|page=155}}

The Quaker Yearly Meetings supporting the religious beliefs of Joseph John Gurney were known as ''Gurneyite'' yearly meetings. Many eventually collectively became the Five Years Meeting and then [[Friends United Meeting]], although [[London Yearly Meeting]], which had been strongly Gurneyite in the 19th century, did not join either of these groups. These Quaker yearly meetings make up the largest proportion of Quakers in the world today.

Some ''orthodox'' Quakers in America disliked the move towards evangelical Christianity and saw it as a dilution of Friends' traditional orthodox Christian belief in being inwardly led by the [[Holy Spirit]]. These Friends were led by [[John Wilbur (Quaker minister)|John Wilbur]], who was expelled from his yearly meeting in 1842. He and his supporters formed their own Conservative Friends Yearly Meeting. In the UK in 1868 some Friends broke away from [[London Yearly Meeting]] for the same reason. They formed a separate body of Friends called [[Britain Yearly Meeting#Fritchley General Meeting|Fritchley General Meeting]], which remained distinct and separate from London Yearly Meeting until 1968. Similar Christian splits took place in Canada. The Yearly Meetings that supported John Wilbur's religious beliefs were known as ''Conservative'' Friends.

===Richmond Declaration===
In 1887, a Gurneyite Quaker of British descent, [[Joseph Bevan Braithwaite]], proposed to Friends a statement of faith known as the [[Richmond Declaration]]. This statement of faith was agreed to by 95 of the representatives at a meeting of [[Friends United Meeting|Five Years Meeting]] Friends, but unexpectedly the Richmond Declaration was not adopted by London Yearly Meeting because a vocal minority, including [[Edward Grubb (Quaker)|Edward Grubb]], opposed it.<ref>{{cite book|last=Kennedy|first=Thomas C.|title=British Quakerism 1860–1920: The Transformation of a Religious Community|year=2001|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York}}</ref>

[[File:BrummanaMissionHouse.jpg|thumb|Friends' Syrian Mission, 1874, built this mission house in [[Ramallah]]]]
Following the [[Christian revival]]s in the mid-19th century, Friends in Great Britain wanted to start missionary activity overseas. The first missionaries were sent to [[Benares]] ([[Varanasi]]), in India, in 1866. The Friends Foreign Mission Association was formed in 1868, and sent missionaries to [[Madhya Pradesh]], India, forming what is now Mid-India Yearly Meeting; and later to [[Madagascar]] from 1867, China from 1896, [[Sri Lanka]] from 1896, and [[Pemba Island]] from 1897.<ref name="mundus" /> The ''Friends Syrian Mission'' was established in 1874, which among other institutions ran the [[Ramallah Friends Schools]], which still exist today. Swiss missionary [[Theophilus Waldmeier]] founded [[Brummana High School]] in [[Lebanon]] in 1873.<ref name=mundus>{{cite web|title=Gateway to missionary collections in the United Kingdom|url=http://www.mundus.ac.uk/cgi-bin/search?coll_id=235&inst_id=7|publisher=MUNDUS}}</ref> Evangelical Friends Churches from [[Ohio Yearly Meeting]] sent missionaries to India in 1896,<ref name="Century of Planting">{{cite book|last=Nixon|first=Eva Anna|title=A Century of Planting: A history of the American Friends' mission in India|publisher=Barclay Press|location=Newburg, OR, USA|year=1985 |isbn=0-913342-55-6}}</ref> forming what is now [[Bundelkhand Yearly Meeting]]. Cleveland Friends went to [[Mombasa]], [[Kenya]], and started what was the most successful Friends' mission. Christian Quakerism spread within [[Kenya]] and to [[Uganda]], [[Tanzania]], [[Burundi]], and [[Rwanda]].

===Theory of evolution===
{{Main article|Quakers in science}}
The [[theory of evolution]] described by [[Charles Darwin]] in ''[[On the Origin of Species]]'' (1859) was opposed by many Quakers in the 19th century,<ref>{{cite web|last=Britain Yearly Meeting|title=Quakers and Science|url=http://www.quaker.org.uk/quakers-and-science|access-date=17 November 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130113071213/http://www.quaker.org.uk/quakers-and-science|archive-date=13 January 2013|dead-url=yes}}</ref> particularly by older evangelical Quakers who dominated the Religious Society of Friends in Great Britain. These religious leaders were suspicious of Darwin's theory, and believed that natural selection needed to be supplemented by another process.<ref name="Quakers & Evolution">{{cite book|last=Cantor|first=Geoffrey|title=Quakers, Jews, and science religious responses to modernity and the sciences in Britain, 1650–1900.|year=2005|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|isbn=9780199276684|url=http://www.oxfordscholarship.com/view/10.1093/0199276684.001.0001/acprof-9780199276684-chapter-7|chapter=Quaker Responses to Evolution}}</ref> For example, influential British Quaker scientist [[Edward Newman (entomologist)|Edward Newman]]<ref>{{cite web|last=Britain Yearly Meeting|title=Edward Newman (1801–1876)|url=http://www.quaker.org.uk/edward-newman-1801-1876|access-date=17 November 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130207081241/http://www.quaker.org.uk/edward-newman-1801-1876|archive-date=7 February 2013|dead-url=yes}}</ref> said the theory was "not compatible with our notions of creation as delivered from the hands of a Creator".

But some young Friends, such as [[John Wilhelm Rowntree]] and [[Edward Grubb (Quaker)|Edward Grubb]], supported Darwin's theories, adopting a doctrine of progressive revelation with evolutionary ideas.<ref name="Quakers & Evolution" /> In the United States, Joseph Moore taught the theory of evolution at the Quaker [[Earlham College]] as early as 1861<ref>{{cite journal|last=Cooper|first=William|title=Joseph Moore: Quaker Evolutionist|journal=Indiana Magazine of History|date=June 1976|volume=72|issue=2|pages=123–137|jstor=27790107}}</ref> and was probably one of the first teachers in the Midwest to do so.<ref>{{cite web|title=Presidential Gallery: Joseph Moore|url=http://www.earlham.edu/about/president/gallery/moore}}</ref> Acceptance of the theory of evolution became more widespread in those Yearly Meetings, which moved toward [[liberal Christianity]] in the 20th century, while a belief in [[creationism]] persists within evangelical Friends Churches, particularly in East Africa and parts of the U.S.

===Quaker Renaissance===
In the late 19th century and early 20th century a religious movement known as the ''Quaker Renaissance'' movement began within London Yearly Meeting. Young Friends in London Yearly Meeting at this time moved away from evangelicalism and towards liberal Christianity.<ref name=Packer>{{cite journal|last=Packer|first=Ian|title=Religion and the New Liberalism: The Rowntree Family, Quakerism and Social Reform |journal=Journal of British Studies|date=1 April 2003 |volume=42 |issue=2 |pages=236–257 |doi=10.1086/345607|jstor=10.1086/345607|issn=0021-9371}}</ref> This Quaker Renaissance movement was particularly influenced by Rowntree, Grubb, and [[Rufus Jones (writer)|Rufus Jones]]. These Liberal Friends promoted the theory of evolution, modern [[biblical criticism]], and the social meaning of Christ's teaching—encouraging Friends to follow the New Testament example of Christ by performing good works. These men downplayed the evangelical Quaker belief in the [[Atonement in Christianity|atonement]] of Christ on the Cross at Calvary.<ref name=Packer /> After the Manchester Conference in England in 1895, one thousand British Friends met to consider the future of British Quakerism and, as a result, liberal Quaker thought gradually increased within London Yearly Meeting.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Blamires|first=David|title=The context and character of the 1895 Manchester Conference|journal=Friends Quarterly|year=1996|volume=30|page=50}}</ref>

===Conscientious objection===
[[File:Friends Ambulance Unit ambulance driver, with his vehicle in Wolfsburg, Germany.jpg|thumb|FAU ambulance and driver, Germany, 1945]]
During [[World War I]] and [[World War II]], Friends' opposition to war was put to the test. Many Friends became [[conscientious objectors]] and some formed the [[Friends Ambulance Unit]] with the aim of ''co-operating with others to build up a new world rather than fighting to destroy the old'', and the [[American Friends Service Committee]]. [[Birmingham, UK]] had a strong Quaker community during the war.<ref name=Roberts>{{cite book|last1=Roberts|first1=Sian|title=Birmingham Remembering 1914–18}}</ref> Many British Quakers were conscripted into the [[Non-Combatant Corps]] during both world wars.

===Formation of Friends World Committee for Consultation===
After the two great wars brought the different kinds of Quakers closer together, Friends from different yearly meetings—many of whom had served together in the Friends Ambulance Unit, on the American Friends Service Committee, and in other relief work—later held several Quaker World Conferences; this resulted in the creation of a standing body of Friends, the [[Friends World Committee for Consultation]].

===Evangelical Friends===
After World War I, a growing desire for a more fundamentalist approach among some Friends began a split among [[Friends United Meeting|Five Years Meetings]]. In 1926, Oregon Yearly Meeting seceded from [[Friends United Meeting|Five Years Meeting]], bringing together several other yearly meetings and scattered monthly meetings. In 1947, the [[Association of Evangelical Friends]] was formed, with triennial meetings until 1970. In 1965, this was replaced by the Evangelical Friends Alliance, which in 1989, became [[Evangelical Friends Church International]].<ref>[http://www.nwfriends.org/what-friends-believe/historical-statement/ Northwest Yearly Meeting Historical Statement] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080131215748/http://www.nwfriends.org/what-friends-believe/historical-statement/ |date=31 January 2008 }}</ref>

===Role of women===
[[File:SugarGroveFriendsDivision.jpg|thumb|left|[[Sugar Grove Conservative Friends Meeting House]], built 1870 in Indiana, with an openable partition between male and female sections]]
In the 1650s, individual Quaker women prophesied and preached publicly, developing charismatic personas and spreading the sect. This practice was bolstered by the movement's firm concept of spiritual equality for men and women.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Visionary Women: Ecstatic Prophecy in Seventeenth-Century England|last=Mack|first=Phyllis|publisher=University of California Press|year=1995|isbn=|location=Berkeley|pages=165–211}}</ref> Moreover, Quakerism initially was propelled by the nonconformist behaviours of its followers, especially women who broke from social norms.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Mack|first1=Phyllis|title=Visionary Women: Ecstatic Prophecy in Seventeenth-Century England|date=1995|publisher=University of California Press|location=Berkeley|page=3}}</ref> By the 1660s, the progress of the movement resulted in more structured organisation, which led to separate women's meetings.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Trevett|first1=Christine|title=Quaker Women Prophets in England and Wales, 1650–1700|date=2000|publisher=Edwin Mellen Press|location=Lewiston, NY|page=12}}</ref> Through the women's meeting, women oversaw domestic and community life, including marriage.<ref name="Levy 78"/> From the beginning, Quaker women, most notably [[Margaret Fell]], played an important role in defining Quakerism.<ref>{{cite book|last=Levy|first=Barry|title=Quakers and the American Family|pages=69, 221}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Bacon|first=Margaret|title=Mothers of Feminism|pages=24}}</ref> Others active in proselytising included [[Mary Penington]], [[Mary Mollineux]] and [[Barbara Blaugdone]].<ref>{{cite book|title=Persecution and Pluralism: Calvinists and Religious Minorities in Early Modern Europe 1550–1700|editor1-first=Richard|editor1-last=Bonney|editor2-first=David J.

In the early years of Quakerism, George Fox faced resistance in developing and establishing women's meetings. As controversy increased, Fox did not fully adhere to this agenda; for example, he established the London Six Weeks Meeting in 1671, as a regulatory body, led by 35 women and 49 men.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Mack|first1=Phyllis|title=VIsionary Women: Ecstatic Prophecy in Seventeenth-Century England|date=1995|publisher=University of California Press|location=Berkeley|page=289}}</ref> Regardless, conflict culminated in the Wilkinson–Story split, in which a portion of the Quaker community left to worship independently in protest of women's meetings.<ref>{{cite book|last=Janney|first=Samuel|title=History of the Religious Society of Friends, from its Rise to the Year 1828|year=1861|publisher=Hayes & Zell|location=Philadelphia|pages=298}}</ref> After several years, the schism became largely resolved, testifying to the resistance of some within the Quaker community, and to the spiritual role of women that Fox and Margaret Fell had encouraged. Also particularly within the relatively prosperous Quaker communities of the eastern United States, the focus on the child and "holy conversation" gave women unusual community power, although they were largely excluded from the market economy. With the Hicksite–Orthodox split of 1827–28, Orthodox women found their spiritual role decreased, while Hicksite women retained greater influence.

===Friends in business===
[[File:John Cadbury.jpg|thumb|upright|English Quaker [[John Cadbury]] founded [[Cadbury]] in [[Birmingham]], England in 1824, selling tea, coffee and drinking chocolate.]]
Described as "natural capitalists" by the [[BBC]], dynasties of Quakers were successful in business matters.<ref name=Jackson2010 /> This included ironmaking by [[Abraham Darby I]] (which played an important role in the [[Industrial Revolution]] that commenced in Britain),<ref>{{cite news |title=Danny Boyle's intro on Olympics programme |url=http://www.awardsdaily.com/blog/2012/07/27/danny-boyles-intro-on-olympics-programme/ |work=Awards Daily |first=Ryan|last=Adams|date=27 July 2012 |accessdate=20 November 2016}}</ref><ref name="Quaker Enterprise">{{cite book |last=Burns Windsor |first=D |year=1980 |title=The Quaker Enterprise: Friends in Business |publisher=Frederick Muller Ltd |location=London |isbn=0-584-10257-7}}</ref> and [[Abraham Darby (disambiguation)|his family]]; banking, including [[Lloyds Banking Group]] (founded by [[Sampson Lloyd]]),<ref name="Quaker Enterprise" /> [[Barclays PLC]],<ref name="Quaker Enterprise" /> [[Backhouse's Bank]] and [[Gurney's Bank]]; life assurance ([[Friends Provident]]); pharmaceuticals ([[Allen & Hanburys]]<ref name="Quaker Enterprise" />); chocolate ([[Cadbury]],<ref name="Quaker Enterprise" /> [[Terry's]], [[J.

Clark|Clarks]]).

=== Friends in international development ===
International volunteering organisations such as [[Service Civil International]] and [[International Voluntary Service]] were founded by leading Quakers.

[[Eric Baker (activist)|Eric Baker]], a prominent Quaker, was one of the founders of [[Amnesty International]] and also the [[Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament]].

The Quaker [[Edith Pye]] established the national Famine Relief Committee in May 1942, encouraging the setting up of a network of local famine relief committees, among the most energetic of which was the Oxford Committee for Famine Relief. This evolved to become the charity [[Oxfam]]. 

===Friends in education===
Initially, Quakers had no ordained [[clergy]], and thus needed no [[seminary|seminaries]] for theological training. In England, Quaker schools sprang up, with [[Friends School Saffron Walden]] being the most prominent.<ref>For information about Quaker schools in Great Britain and Ireland see [http://www.quaker.org.uk/subject-guides Quaker Schools in Great Britain and Ireland: A selective bibliography of histories and guide to records].</ref> Later in America they founded [[William Penn Charter School]] (1689), [[Wilmington Friends School]] (1748),<ref>{{cite book|title=Friends' Intelligencer, Volume 74|date=1917|publisher=Friends Intelligencer Association, Limited|location=Philadelphia|page=613}}</ref> [[Moorestown Friends School]] (1785), [[Westtown School]] (1799), [[Germantown Friends School]] (1845), [[Scattergood Friends School]] (1890), [[Haverford College]] (1833),<ref name="Yount">{{cite book |author=David Yount |title=How the Quakers invented America |year=2007 |pages=83–84}}</ref> [[Guilford College]] (1837), [[Olney Friends School]] (1837), [[Pickering College]] (1842), [[Earlham College]] & [[Earlham School of Religion]] (1847), [[Swarthmore College]] (1864), [[Wilmington College (Ohio)]] (1870), [[William Penn University|Penn College (Iowa)]] (1873), [[Bryn Mawr College]] (1885), [[Friends Pacific Academy]] (now [[George Fox University]]) (1885), [[Malone University|Cleveland Bible College]] (now [[Malone University]]) (1892),<ref>{{cite web|title=History of Malone|url=http://www.malone.edu/about-malone/history-of-malone.php|publisher=Malone University|access-date=26 November 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111218082438/http://www.malone.edu/about-malone/history-of-malone.php|archive-date=18 December 2011|dead-url=yes}}</ref> [[George School]] (1893), [[Friends University]] (1898), Training School for Christian Workers (now [[Azusa Pacific University]]) (1899),<ref>{{cite web|title=History of Friends at APU|url=http://www.apu.edu/friendscenter/history/|publisher=Azusa Pacific University}}</ref> [[Whittier College]] (1901), and [[Barclay College|Friends Bible College]] (now [[Barclay College]]) (1917).<ref>{{cite web|title=About Barclay|url=http://barclaycollege.edu/index.php?id=about-bc|publisher=Barclay College|access-date=26 November 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111207231139/http://barclaycollege.edu/index.php?id=about-bc|archive-date=7 December 2011|dead-url=yes}}</ref> In Australia, the [[Friends' School, Hobart]] was founded in 1887 and has grown to become the largest Quaker school in the world. In Great Britain, they organised [[Woodbrooke College]] in 1903. In Kenya, Quakers founded Friends Bible Institute (now Friends Theological College) in [[Kaimosi]], [[Kenya]], in 1942.

===Friends and slavery===
Some Quakers in North America and Great Britain became well known for their involvement in the abolition of slavery. But until the [[American Revolution]], it was fairly common for Friends in [[British America]] to own slaves. During the early to mid-1700s, disquiet about this practice arose among Friends, best exemplified by the testimonies of [[Anthony Benezet]] and [[John Woolman]], and this resulted in an abolition movement among Friends. By the time of the American Revolution few Friends owned slaves. At the end of the war in 1783, Yarnall family members along with fellow Meeting House Friends petitioned the Continental Congress to abolish slavery. This petition preceded the 13th Amendment in 1865 by nearly eighty years. In 1790, the Society of Friends petitioned the United States Congress as the first organisation to take a collective stand against slavery and the slave trade.

One example of a reversal in sentiment about slavery took place in the life of [[Moses Brown]], one of four Rhode Island brothers who, in 1764, organised and funded the tragic and fateful voyage of the [[slave ship]] ''Sally''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.stg.brown.edu/projects/sally/|title=Voyage of the Slave Ship Sally}}</ref> Moses Brown broke away from his three brothers, became an abolitionist, and converted to Christian Quakerism. During the 19th century, Quakers such as [[Levi Coffin]] played a major role in helping enslaved people escape through the [[Underground Railroad]].<ref>Ralph Dannheiser, "[http://iipdigital.usembassy.gov/st/english/article/2008/11/20081112170035abretnuh3.838748e-02.html Quakers Played Major Role in Ending Slavery in the U.S]", IIP Digital, 12 November 2008</ref> Quaker [[Paul Cuffee]], a free black sea captain and businessman, was active in the abolitionist and resettlement movement in the early part of that century.<ref>Cobb Wiggins, Rosland, "Paul Cuffe: Early Pan-Africanist";  in ''Black Quakers, Brief Biographies''; Kenneth Ives, Editor; Progressive Publisher, 1995</ref>

==Theology==
The theological beliefs of Quaker yearly meetings vary considerably. Tolerance of dissent widely varies among yearly meetings.<ref name=QWRC-intro/> Most Friends believe in [[continuing revelation]], the belief that truth is continuously revealed directly to individuals from God. George Fox, an "[[Valiant Sixty|early Friend]]", described it as "Christ has come to teach His people Himself."<ref name=GeorgeFoxsJournal/> Friends often focus on trying to hear God. As [[Isaac Penington (Quaker)|Isaac Penington]] wrote in 1670, "It is not enough to hear of Christ, or read of Christ, but this is the thing—to feel him to be my root, my life, and my foundation..."<ref name=PeningtonLetter/> Quakers reject the idea of [[priest]]s, believing in the [[priesthood of all believers]]. Some Friends express their concept of God using various phrases, including the inner light, inward light of Christ, or Holy Spirit.

Diverse theological beliefs, understandings of the "leading of the Holy Spirit", and statements of "faith and practice" have always existed among Friends.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.quakermaps.com/info|title=A Brief Introduction to Quakerism|date=30 January 2010|work=QuakerMaps.com (Beta)|access-date=13 June 2017}}</ref> Due in part to the emphasis on the immediate guidance of the Holy Spirit, Quaker doctrines have only sometimes been codified as statements of faith, confessions or theological texts; those that do exist include the ''Letter to the Governor of Barbados'' ([[George Fox|Fox]], 1671),<ref>{{cite web|last=Fox|first=George|title=Letter to the Governor of Barbadoes|url=http://www.quakerinfo.com/barbados.shtml}}</ref> ''An Apology for the True Christian Divinity'' ([[Robert Barclay|Barclay]], 1678),<ref>{{cite book|last=Barclay|first=Robert|title=An Apology for the True Christian Divinity|year=1678|url=http://www.qhpress.org/texts/barclay/apology/}}</ref> ''A Catechism and Confession of Faith'' ([[Robert Barclay|Barclay]], 1690),<ref>{{cite book|last=Barclay|first=Robert|title=A Catechism and Confession of Faith|year=1690|url=http://www.qhpress.org/texts/barclay/catechism/index.html}}</ref> ''The Testimony of the Society of Friends on the Continent of America'' (adopted jointly by all [[Friends United Meeting|orthodox yearly meetings]] in U.S., 1830),<ref>{{cite book|title=The Testimony of the Society of Friends on the Continent of America|year=1830|publisher=Richard and George S Wood|location=New York|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CtctAAAAYAAJ&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_ge_summary_r&cad=0#v=onepage&q&f=false}}</ref> the ''[[Richmond Declaration|Richmond Declaration of Faith]]'' (adopted by [[Friends United Meeting|Five Years Meeting]], 1887),<ref>{{cite web|title=Richmond Declaration of Faith|url=http://www.quakerinfo.com/rdf.shtml|publisher=QuakerInfo.com}}</ref> and ''Essential Truths'' ([[Rufus Jones (writer)|Jones]] and Wood, adopted by [[Friends United Meeting|Five Years Meeting]], 1922).<ref>{{cite web|title=Essential Truths|url=http://www.quakerinfo.com/esstruth.shtml|publisher=QuakerInfo.com}}</ref> As a public statement of faith, most yearly meetings publish their own [[Book of Discipline (Quaker)|Book of Discipline]], which expresses Christian discipleship within the experience of Friends in that yearly meeting.

===Conservative===

{{Main article|Conservative Friends}}

[[Conservative Friends]] (also known as "Wilburites" after their founder, [[John Wilbur (Quaker minister)|John Wilbur]]), share some of the beliefs of Fox and the Early Friends. Many Wilburites see themselves as the Quakers whose beliefs are truest to original Quaker doctrine, arguing that the majority of Friends "broke away" from the Wilburites in the 19th and 20th centuries (rather than vice versa). Conservative Friends place their trust in the immediate guidance of God.<ref name=quakerfinder/> They completely reject all forms of [[religious symbolism]] and outward [[sacraments]], such as the [[Eucharist]] and [[water baptism]]. Conservative Friends do not believe in relying upon the practice of outward rites and sacraments, to have a living relationship with God through Christ; believing that holiness can exist in all of the activities of one's daily life—and that all of life is sacred in God. Many Conservative Friends believe that a meal held with others can become a form of [[Communion (Christianity)|communion]] with God, and with one another.

In the U.S., Conservative Friends are part of three small Quaker Yearly Meetings in Ohio, North Carolina and Iowa; Ohio Yearly Meeting (Conservative) is generally considered to be the most Bible-centred of the three, retaining Christian Quakers who use plain language, wear plain dress, and live in small villages or rural areas more than the Conservative Friends from the other two Conservative Friends Yearly Meetings.<ref name=Wilburite-Gurneyite/>

In 2007, total membership of these Yearly Meetings was around 1642,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://fwccamericas.org/find_friends/stats_by_country.shtml|title=FWCC Section of the Americas|website=fwccamericas.org|access-date=25 June 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160419003049/http://fwccamericas.org/find_friends/stats_by_country.shtml|archive-date=19 April 2016|dead-url=yes}}</ref> making them around 0.4% of the world family of Quakers.

===Evangelical===
{{See also|Evangelical Friends Church International}}

[[File:Old Camara 038.JPG|thumb|Phoenix Friends Church sign|Sign at entrance of [[Phoenix, Arizona|Phoenix]] Friends Church]]
Evangelical Friends regard Jesus Christ as their personal Lord and Saviour,<ref name=quakerfinder/> and have similar religious beliefs to other [[evangelicalism|evangelical]] Christians. They believe in, and hold a high regard for, the [[penal substitution]] of the [[Atonement in Christianity|atonement]] of Christ on the Cross at Calvary, [[biblical infallibility]], and the need for every person to personally experience a relationship with God.<ref name="Friends Beliefs">{{cite web|last=Evangelical Friends Church International|title=Friends Beliefs|url=http://www.evangelicalfriends.org/6}}</ref> They believe that the purpose of the Evangelical Friends Church is to evangelise the unsaved people of the world, to spiritually transform them through God's love and through social service to others.<ref name="Friends Beliefs" /> Evangelical Friends regard the Bible as the infallible and self-authenticating Word of God. The statement of faith of [[Evangelical Friends International]] is comparable to the statement of faith of other Evangelical churches. Evangelical Friends who are members of Evangelical Friends International are mainly located in the U.S., Central America, and Asia. Beginning in the 1880s, some Friends began using outward sacraments in their Sunday services, first in Evangelical Friends Church–Eastern Region (then known as Ohio Yearly Meeting [Damascus]). Friends Church–Southwest Region has also approved the practice of using the outward sacraments in their Sunday services. In places where Evangelical Friends are engaged in missionary work, such as in Africa, Latin America, and Asia, adult baptism by immersion in water is carried out. This practice differs from most other Quaker branches of the Religious Society of Friends. {{As of|2014}}, EFCI claims to represent more than 140,000 Friends,<ref name=EFCI>{{cite web|title=Evangelical Friends Church International|url=http://www.evangelicalfriends.org/}}</ref> roughly 39% of the total number of Friends worldwide.

===Gurneyite===
{{See also|Friends United Meeting}}

Gurneyite Friends (aka Friends United Meeting Friends) are the modern-day followers of the Evangelical Quaker theology first proclaimed by [[Joseph John Gurney]], a 19th-century British Friend. They make up 49% of the total number of Quakers worldwide.<ref name=QWRC-intro /> They regard Jesus Christ as their Teacher and Lord,<ref name=quakerfinder/> and favour working closely with other Protestant Christian churches. Gurneyite Friends place more emphasis on the authority of the Bible as the direct Word of God than on personal and direct experience of God in their lives. Both children and adults participate in ongoing religious education which emphasises orthodox Christian teaching from the Bible, and in relationship to both orthodox Christian Quaker history and Quaker testimonies. Gurneyite Friends subscribe to a set of orthodox Christian doctrines, such as those found in the [[Richmond Declaration]] of faith. In subsequent years, conflict arose among Gurneyite Friends in relation to the Richmond Declaration of faith. Thus, after a while, the Richmond Declaration of faith was adopted by nearly all of the Gurneyite yearly meetings. The Five Years Meeting of Friends reaffirmed their loyalty to the Richmond Declaration of faith in 1912, but specifically stated that it was not to constitute a Christian creed. Although Gurneyism was the main form of Quakerism in Great Britain in the 19th century, Gurneyite Friends today are in America, Ireland, Africa and India. Many Gurneyite Friends combine "waiting worship" (unprogrammed worship) with religious practices commonly found in other Protestant Christian churches, such as the reading of the Bible and the singing of Hymns. A small minority of Gurneyite Friends practice entirely unprogrammed worship.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://fum.org/quaker-life-local-meeting-directory/ |title=Quaker Life – Local Meeting Directory |publisher=Friends United Meeting |accessdate=25 August 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141112213838/http://fum.org/quaker-life-local-meeting-directory/ |archive-date=12 November 2014 |dead-url=yes  }}</ref>

===Holiness===
{{See also|Central Yearly Meeting of Friends}}

Holiness Friends are heavily influenced by the [[Holiness movement]], in particular [[John Wesley]]'s doctrine of [[Christian perfection]], also called "entire sanctification". This doctrine states that loving God and humanity totally, as exemplified by Christ, enables believers to rid themselves of voluntary sin. This was a predominant view within Quakerism in the United Kingdom and United States in the 19th century, and it influenced other branches of Quakerism. Holiness Friends argue (leaning on writings that include George Fox's message of ''perfection'') that early Friends had the same understanding of holiness.<ref name="central">{{cite web|last=Central Yearly Meeting of Friends|title=About Us|url=http://www.centralyearlymeetingoffriends.org/AboutUs.dsp|access-date=6 January 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120205212906/http://www.centralyearlymeetingoffriends.org/AboutUs.dsp|archive-date=5 February 2012|dead-url=yes}}</ref>

Today, while some Friends hold holiness beliefs within most yearly meetings, it is the predominant theological view of [[Central Yearly Meeting of Friends]], (founded in 1926 specifically to promote holiness theology) and the Holiness Mission of the Bolivian Evangelical Friends Church (founded by missionaries from that meeting in 1919, the largest group of Friends in Bolivia).<ref>{{cite book|author1=Margery Post Abbott|display-authors=etal|title=Historical Dictionary of the Friends (Quakers)|publisher=Scarecrow Press|location=Lanham, MD|isbn=0-8108-7088-6|pages=327–328|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WlTnzA6kHYwC&pg=PA328&lpg=PA328&dq=Bolivian+Holiness+Mission+Evangelical+Friends+Church&source=bl&ots=_7cCaucsFV&sig=a53kHYYP5vfM8AEozXPzLiGzPrI&hl=en&sa=X&ei=MOZsT6HYDqK-0QWIyM3CBg&ved=0CE8Q6AEwBg#v=onepage&q=Bolivian%20Holiness%20Mission%20Evangelical%20Friends%20Church&f=false|edition=2nd}}</ref>

===Liberal===
{{See also|Friends General Conference|Britain Yearly Meeting|Beanite Quakerism|}}

Liberal Quakerism generally refers to Friends who have taken ideas from liberal Christianity, often sharing a similar mix of ideas, such as more critical Biblical [[hermeneutics]], often with a focus on the [[social gospel]]. The ideas of ''That of God in everyone'' and the ''[[inner light]]'' were popularised by American Friend [[Rufus Jones (writer)|Rufus Jones]] in the early 20th century. He and [[John Wilhelm Rowntree]] originated the movement. Liberal Friends were predominant in Great Britain in the 20th century, and among US meetings affiliated to [[Friends General Conference]]; and some meetings in Canada, Europe, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa.

These ideas remain an important part of liberal Friends' understanding of God. Liberal Friends highlight the importance of good works, particularly living a life that upholds the virtues preached by Jesus. They often emphasise pacifism, treating others equally, living simply and telling the truth.<ref name=QWRC-intro/>

Like Conservative Friends, Liberal Friends reject [[religious symbolism]] and sacraments, such as water baptism and the Eucharist. While Liberal Friends recognise the potential of these outward forms for awakening experiences of the Inward [[Light of the World|Light]] of Christ, they are not part of their worship, and are believed unnecessary to authentic Christian spirituality.

The Bible remains central to most Liberal Friends' worship, and almost all meetings make it available in the [[Friends Meeting House|meeting house]], (often on a table in the centre of the room), which attendees may read privately or publicly during worship. But Liberal Friends decided that the Scriptures should give way to God's leading, if God leads them in a way that is contrary to the Bible. Many Friends are also influenced by liberal Christian theologians, and modern [[Biblical criticism]]. They often adopt non-propositional Biblical hermeneutics, such as believing that the Bible is an anthology of human authors' beliefs and feelings about God, rather than Holy Writ, and that multiple interpretations of the Scriptures are acceptable.

Liberal Friends believe that a corporate confession of faith would be an obstacle—both to authentic listening and to new insight. As a non-creedal form of Christianity, Liberal Quakerism is receptive to a wide range of religious faith understandings. Most Liberal Quaker Yearly Meetings publish a [[Book of Discipline (Quaker)|Faith and Practice]], a book with a range of religious experiences of what it means to be a Friend in that Yearly Meeting.

===Universalist===
{{main article| Quaker Universalist Fellowship}}
Universalist Friends affirm [[religious pluralism]], that there are many different paths to God and that understandings of the divine reached through non-Christian religious experiences are as valid as Christian understandings. This group was founded in the late 1970s by John Linton. Linton had worshipped God with the Delhi Worship Group in India (an independent meeting not affiliated to any yearly meeting or wider Quaker group) with Christians, Muslims and Hindus worshipping together.<ref name="Universalist History">{{cite journal|last=Rickermann|first=Sally|title=Quaker Universalist Fellowship: Its History|journal=Journal of the Quaker Universalist Fellowship|year=2007|issue=46|url=http://www.universalistfriends.org/uf046.html#Rickerman}}</ref>
Following a move to Great Britain, he founded the [[Quaker Universalist Fellowship]] in 1978. Later his views spread to the US, where the Quaker Universalist Fellowship was founded in 1983.<ref name="Universalist History" /> Most of the Friends who joined these two fellowships were Liberal Friends from Britain Yearly Meeting in the United Kingdom, and Liberal Friends from Friends General Conference in the United States. Interest in Quaker Universalism is low among Friends from other Yearly meetings. The views of the Universalists provoked controversy{{Citation needed|date=September 2018}} between themselves and Christian Quakers within Britain Yearly Meeting, and within Friends General Conference, during the 1980s. Despite the label, Quaker "Universalists" are not necessarily [[Christian Universalism|Christian Universalists]], embracing the doctrine of [[universal reconciliation]].

===Non-theist===
{{main article|Nontheist Quakers}}

These Friends have views similar to other post-Christian non-theists in other churches such as the [[Sea of Faith]] within the [[Anglican]] church. They are predominantly atheists, agnostics, and humanists who nevertheless value membership in a religious organization. The first organisation for non-theist Friends was the ''Humanistic Society of Friends'', founded in Los Angeles in 1939. This organisation remained small and was absorbed into the [[American Humanist Association]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Cresson|first=Os|title=Roots and Flowers of Quaker Nontheism|url=http://www.nontheistfriends.org/article/roots-and-flowers-of-quaker-nontheism-2/|access-date=6 January 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120209104940/http://www.nontheistfriends.org/article/roots-and-flowers-of-quaker-nontheism-2/|archive-date=9 February 2012|dead-url=yes}}</ref> More recently, interest in non-theism resurfaced, particularly led by British Friend [[David Boulton (UK journalist)|David Boulton]], who founded the 40-member ''Nontheist Friends Network'' in 2011.<ref>{{cite web|title=New Nontheist Friends Network in Britain|url=http://www.nontheistfriends.org/article/new-nontheist-friends-network-in-britain/|publisher=nontheistfriends.org}}</ref> Non-theism is controversial, leading some Christian Quakers from within Britain Yearly Meeting to call for non-theists to be refused membership.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Heathfield|first=D|title=Non-theist Friends Network|journal=The Friend|date=27 May 2011|volume=169|issue=21|url=http://thefriend.org/article/letters-27-may-2011/}}</ref>
In one study of Friends in [[Britain Yearly Meeting]], around 30% of Quakers had views that were described as [[non-theism|non-theistic]], [[agnostic]], or [[atheist]].<ref>{{cite book |last=Dandelion |first=Pink |title=A Sociological Analysis of the Theology of Quakers: The Silent Revolution |publisher=Edwin Mellen Press |location=Lewiston, NY |year=1996}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last=Heron |first=Alistair |title=Caring, Conviction, Commitment: Dilemmas of Quaker Membership Today |publisher=Quaker Home Service |location=London |year=1992}}</ref> Another study of British Quakers found that of the 727 members of the Religious Society of Friends who completed the survey, 75.1% said that they consider themselves to be Christian; 17.6% did not consider themselves Christian; and 7.3% of the members either did not answer or circled both answers.<ref name=Mellor/>{{rp|p.41}} A further 22% of Quakers did not consider themselves to be Christian, but fulfilled a definition of being a Christian in that they said that they devoutly followed the teachings and example of Jesus Christ.<ref name=Mellor/>{{rp|p.52}} In the same survey 86.9% said that they believed in God.<ref name=Mellor>{{cite thesis |last=Mellor |first=Katherine |title=Christian Belief in the Religious Society of Friends (Quakers): a Response to the Claim That British Friends Are Post-Christian |type=M.Phil. |year=2009 |publisher=University of Birmingham |url=http://etheses.bham.ac.uk/682/1/Mellor10MPhil.pdf |pages=39–40}}</ref>

==Practical theology==
[[File:1688 germantown petition table.jpg|alt=|thumb|In 1688, at this table in [[Germantown, Philadelphia]], Quakers and [[Mennonites]] signed a common declaration denouncing slavery]]
Quakers bear witness or ''[[Religious testimony|testify]]'' to their religious beliefs in their spiritual lives,<ref name=QuakerTestimonies2005/> drawing on the [[Epistle of James|James]] advice that ''faith by itself, if it is not accompanied by action, is dead''.<ref name=James>{{bibleverse|James|2:17|NIV}}</ref> This religious witness is rooted in their immediate experience of God and verified by the Bible, especially in Jesus Christ's life and teachings. They may bear witness in many ways, according to how they believe God is leading them. Although Quakers share how they relate to God and the world, mirroring Christian ethical codes, for example the [[Sermon on the Mount]] or the [[Sermon on the Plain]], Friends argue that they feel personally moved by God rather than following an ethical code.

Some theologians classify Friends' religious witness into categories—known by some Friends as ''testimonies.'' These Friends believe these principles and practices testify to, witness to, or provide evidence for God's truth. No categorisation is universally accepted.<ref name=testimonies/>

In East Africa, Friends teach peace and non-violence, simplicity, honesty, equality, humility, marriage and sexual ethics (defining marriage as lifelong between one man and one woman), sanctity of life (opposition to abortion), cultural conflicts and Christian life.<ref>Friends United Meeting in East Africa (2002) "[http://www.quakerinfo.com/eastafricafandp.pdf Christian Faith and Practice in the Friends Church]".</ref>

In the United States, the acronym SPICES is often used by many Yearly Meetings (Simplicity, Peace, Integrity, Community, Equality and Stewardship). Stewardship is not recognised as a Testimony by all Yearly Meetings. Rocky Mountain Yearly Meeting Friends put their faith in action through living their lives by the following principles: prayer, personal integrity, stewardship (which includes giving away minimum of 10% income and refraining from lotteries), marriage and family (lifelong commitment), regard for mind and body (refraining from certain amusements, propriety and modesty of dress, abstinence from alcohol, tobacco and drugs), peace and non-violence (including refusing to participate in war), abortion (opposition to abortion, practical ministry to women with unwanted pregnancy and promotion of adoption), human sexuality, the Christian and state (look to God for authority, not the government), capital punishment (find alternatives), human equality, women in ministry (recognising women and men have an equal part to play in ministry).<ref>Rocky Mountain Yearly Meeting of the Friends Church (1997) "[http://www.rmym.org/Faith_And_Practice_Print.php The Faith and Practice] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120627173003/http://www.rmym.org/Faith_And_Practice_Print.php |date=27 June 2012 }}"</ref>

In the UK, the acronym STEP or PEST is used (peace, equality, simplicity and truth). In his book ''Quaker Speak'', British Friend Alastair Heron, lists the following ways in which British Friends testify to God:<ref>{{cite book|last=Heron|first=Alastair|title=Quaker Speak|year=2008|url=http://www.s113871194.websitehome.co.uk/qsol/main.htm|access-date=11 June 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111005150245/http://www.s113871194.websitehome.co.uk/qsol/main.htm|archive-date=5 October 2011|dead-url=yes}}</ref> Opposition to betting and gambling, [[Capital punishment#Quakers|capital punishment]], conscription, hat honour (the largely historical practice of dipping one's hat toward social superiors), [[Testimony of Integrity#Oaths and fair-dealing|oaths]], [[History of the Religious Society of Friends#Abolition of Slavery|slavery]], [[#Calendar and church holidays|times and seasons]], [[tithe|tithing]] and promotion of [[Testimony of Integrity|integrity]] (or truth), [[Peace Testimony|peace]], penal reform, plain language, relief of suffering, [[Testimony of Simplicity|simplicity]], social order, Sunday observance, [[sustainability]], temperance and moderation.

===Calendar and church holidays===

Quakers traditionally use numbers to denominate the names of the months and days of the week, something they call the plain calendar. This does not use names of calendar units derived from the names of pagan deities. The days begin with First Day (Sunday) and ends on Seventh Day (Saturday), and months run from First Month (January) to Twelfth Month (December). This is based on the terms used in the Bible: e.g., Jesus Christ's followers went to the tomb early on the First Day of the week.<ref>{{bibleverse|Mark|16:2|NIV}}, {{bibleverse|Luke|24:1|NIV}}, {{bibleverse|John|20:1|NIV}}, {{bibleverse|John|20:19|NIV}}</ref> The plain calendar emerged in the 17th century in England in the [[Puritan]] movement, but became closely identified with Friends by the end of the 1650s, and was commonly employed into the 20th century. It is less commonly encountered today. The term ''First Day School'' is commonly used, for what is called by most churches ''Sunday School.''

In common with other Christian denominations derived from the 16th century [[Puritanism]], many Friends do not observe religious festivals (e.g. [[Christmas]], [[Lent]], or [[Easter]]), but instead believe that Christ's birth, [[crucifixion]], and [[resurrection]], should be commemorated every day of the year. For example, many Quakers feel that [[fasting]] at [[Lent]], but then eating in excess at other times of the year is [[hypocrisy]] and therefore many Quakers, rather than observing Lent, live a simple lifestyle all the year round (''see [[Testimony of Simplicity]]''). These practices are often referred to as the ''testimony against times and seasons.''

Some Friends are non-Sabbatarians, holding that "every day is the Lord's day", and that what should be done on a First Day should be done every day of the week, although Meeting for Worship is usually held on a First Day, which has been advised since the first advice issued by elders in 1656.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Dewsbury|first1=William|last2=Farnworth|first2=Richard|title=The Epistle from the Elders at Balby, 1656|url=http://www.qhpress.org/texts/balby.html}}</ref>

==Worship==
{{See also|Meeting for worship}}
Most groups of Quakers meet for regular worship. There are two main types of worship worldwide: programmed worship and waiting worship.

===Programmed worship===
{{See also|Friends United Meeting|Evangelical Friends Church International|Central Yearly Meeting of Friends|}}
[[File:West Mansfield Friends Church.jpg|alt=|thumb|right|West Mansfield Friends Church, Ohio, affiliated with the [[Evangelical Friends Church International]]]]
In ''programmed worship'' there is often a prepared Biblical message, which may be delivered by an individual with theological training from a Bible College. There may be hymns, a sermon, Bible readings, joint prayers and a period of silent worship. The worship resembles the [[church service]]s of other [[Protestant]] denominations, although in most cases does not include the Eucharist. A paid pastor may be responsible for [[pastoral care]]. Worship of this kind is celebrated by about 89% of Friends worldwide.<ref name=QWRC-intro />{{rp|page=5–6}} It is found in many Yearly Meetings in Africa, Asia and parts of the US (central and southern), and is common in programmed meetings affiliated to [[Friends United Meeting]], (who make up around 49% of worldwide membership<ref name=QWRC-intro />{{rp|page=5}}), and evangelical meetings, including those affiliated to [[Evangelical Friends International]], (who make up at least 40% of Friends worldwide<ref name=QWRC-intro />{{rp|page=5–6}}). The religious event is sometimes called a Quaker [[meeting for worship]] or sometimes called a Friends church service. This religious tradition arose among Friends in the United States, in the 19th century, and in response to the many converts to Christian Quakerism during the national [[Great awakening|spiritual revival]] of the time. Friends meetings in Africa and Latin America were generally started by Orthodox Friends from programmed elements of the Society, therefore most African and Latin American Friends worship in a programmed style.

Some Friends also hold "Semi-Programmed" Worship, which brings programmed elements such as hymns and readings into an otherwise unprogrammed worship service.

===Unprogrammed worship===

''Unprogrammed worship'' (also known as ''waiting worship'', "silent worship", or ''holy communion in the manner of Friends)'' is based on the practices of George Fox and the Early Friends, who based their religious beliefs and practices on their interpretation of how the early Christians worshipped God their Heavenly Father. Friends gather together in "expectant waiting upon God" to experience his still small voice leading them from within. There is no plan on how the meeting will proceed, and actual practice varies widely between Meetings and individual worship services. Friends believe that God plans what will happen, with his spirit leading people to speak. When a participant feels led to speak, he or she will stand and share a spoken message of ("[[Christian ministry|vocal ministry]]") in front of others. When this happens, Quakers believe that the spirit of God is speaking through the speaker. After someone has spoken, it is customary to allow a few minutes pass in silence for reflection on what has been said, before further vocal ministry is given. Sometimes a meeting is entirely silent, sometimes many speak. These meetings lasted for several hours in George Fox's day. Modern meetings are often limited to an hour, ending when two people (usually the [[Elder (Christianity)#Quakers (Religious Society of Friends)|elders]]) exchange the [[sign of peace]] by [[handshake]]. This handshake is often shared by the others. This style of worship is the norm in Great Britain, Ireland, the continent of Europe, Australia, New Zealand, Southern Africa, Canada, and parts of the United States (particularly yearly meetings associated with [[Friends General Conference]] and [[Beanite Quakerism]])—constituting about 11%<ref name=QWRC-intro />{{rp|page 5}} of Quakers. Those who worship in this style hold each person to be equal before God and capable of knowing [[Light of the World|the light]] of God directly. Anyone present may speak if they feel led to do so. Traditionally, [[Recorded Minister]]s were recognised for their particular gift in vocal ministry. This religious practice continues among ''Conservative'' Friends and ''Liberal Friends'' (e.g. [[New York Yearly Meeting]]<ref>{{cite web|last=New York Yearly Meeting|title=Formal Guidelines from New York Yearly Meeting's Faith and Practice|url=http://www.nyym.org/index.php?q=node/252}}</ref>). Many meetings where Liberal Friends predominate abolished this religious practice. [[London Yearly Meeting]] of Friends abolished the acknowledging and recording of [[Recorded Minister]]s in 1924.

==Governance and organisation==

===Church government and polity===
<!-- [[Meeting for Business]] redirects to this section -->
[[File:Meeting in York.JPG|alt=|thumb|Quaker Business Meeting in [[York]]]]
[[Ecclesiastical polity|Governance]] and decision making is conducted at a special meeting for worship—often called a ''meeting for worship with a concern for business'' or ''meeting for worship for church affairs'' at which all members can attend, as in a [[Congregationalist polity|Congregational]] church. Quakers consider this to be a form of worship, conducted in the manner of meeting for worship. They believe this is the gathering of believers who ''wait upon the Lord'' to discover God's will, believing that they are not making their own decisions. They seek to understand God's will for the religious community, via the actions of the Holy Spirit within the meeting.<ref name=QuakersinScotland/>

As in a ''meeting for worship'', each member is expected to listen to God, and, if led by Him, stand up and contribute. In some business meetings, Friends wait for the [[Clerk (Quaker)|clerk]] to acknowledge them before speaking. Direct replies to someone's contribution are not permitted, with an aim of seeking truth rather than of debating. A decision is reached when the meeting, as a whole, feels that the "way forward" has been discerned (also called "coming to unity"). There is no voting. On some occasions Friends may delay a decision because they feel the meeting is not following God's will. Others (especially non-Friends) may describe this as [[consensus decision-making]]; however in general Friends continue to seek God's will. It is assumed that, if everyone is attuned to God's spirit, the way forward will become clear.

===International organisation===
{{Main article|Friends World Committee for Consultation}}
[[Friends World Committee for Consultation]] (FWCC) is the international Quaker organisation that loosely unifies the different religious traditions of Quakers; FWCC brings together the largest variety of Friends in the world. Friends World Committee for Consultation is divided into four sections to represent different regions of the world: Africa, Asia West Pacific, Europe and Middle East, and the Americas.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}}

Various organisations associated with Friends include a U.S. lobbying organisation based in [[Washington, D.C.]] called the [[Friends Committee on National Legislation]] (FCNL); service organisations such as the [[American Friends Service Committee]] (AFSC), the [[Quaker United Nations Office]]s, [[Quaker Peace and Social Witness]], Friends Committee on Scouting, the Quaker Peace Centre in Cape Town, South Africa, and the [[Alternatives to Violence Project]].

===Yearly meetings===
{{Main article|Yearly Meeting}}
Quakers today are organised into independent and regional, national bodies called [[Yearly Meetings]], which have often split from one another because of Christian [[doctrinal]] differences. Several associations unite Quakers who share similar religious beliefs—for example [[Evangelical Friends Church International]] unites [[evangelicalism|evangelical Christian Friends]];<ref>{{cite web|title=Friends Beliefs|url=http://www.evangelicalfriends.org/6|publisher=Evangelical Friends Church International}}</ref> [[Friends United Meeting]] unites Friends into "fellowships where Jesus Christ is known, loved, and obeyed as Teacher and Lord;"<ref>{{cite web |title=Friends United Meeting – About Us |url=http://fum.org:80/about-us/ |publisher=Friends United Meeting |accessdate=5 November 2012 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150228204503/http://fum.org/about-us/ |archivedate=28 February 2015 |deadurl=yes  }}</ref> and [[Friends General Conference]] links together Quakers that have non-creedal, liberal religious beliefs. Many Quaker [[Yearly Meeting]]s, are also members of [[Friends World Committee for Consultation]], an international fellowship of Yearly Meetings from different Quaker religious traditions.

===Membership===
A Friend is a member of a Yearly Meeting, usually beginning with membership in a local monthly meeting. Methods for acquiring membership vary; for example, in most Kenyan yearly meetings, attenders who wish to become members are required to take part in around two years of adult education, memorising key Bible passages, and learning about the history of orthodox Christianity, and of Christian Quakerism. Within Britain Yearly Meeting, membership is acquired through a process of [[peer review]], where a potential member is visited by several members who present a report to the other members of the monthly meeting before a decision is reached.

Within some Friends Churches in the Evangelical Friends Church, in particular in Rwanda, Burundi, and parts of the U.S., an adult believer's baptism by immersion in water, is optional. Within Liberal Friends, Conservative Friends, and Pastoral Friends Churches, Friends do not practise [[baptism|water baptism]], [[infant baptism|Christening]], or other initiation ceremonies to admit a new member or a newborn baby. Children are often welcomed into the meeting at their first attendance. Formerly, children born to Quaker parents automatically became members (sometimes called ''Birthright membership''), but this is no longer the case in many areas. Some parents apply for membership on behalf of their children, while others allow the child to decide whether to become a member when they are ready, and older in age. Some meetings adopt a policy that children, some time after becoming young adults, must apply independently for membership.

==Meetings for worship for specific tasks==

===Memorial services===
[[File:George Fox marker Bunhill Fields.jpg|alt=|thumb|The Quaker testimony of simplicity extends to memorialisation as well. Founder George Fox is remembered with a simple grave marker at [[Quaker Gardens, Islington]].]]
Traditional Quaker memorial services are held as a form of worship and are known as memorial meetings. Friends gather for worship and offer remembrances about the deceased. In some Quaker religious traditions, the coffin or ashes are not present. Memorial meetings may be held many weeks after the death, which can enable wider attendance, and can also replace grief with spiritual reflection, and celebration of life to dominate. Memorial meetings can last over an hour, particularly if many people attend. Memorial services give everyone a chance to remember the lost individual in their own way, comforting those present, and re-affirming the love of the people in the wider community.{{Citation needed|date=June 2012}}

===Marriage===
{{Main article|Quaker wedding}}

A ''meeting for worship for the solemnisation of marriage'' in an unprogrammed Friends meeting is similar to any other unprogrammed Meeting for Worship.<ref name=QinGB/> The pair exchange vows before God and gathered witnesses, and the meeting returns to open worship. At the rise of meeting, the witnesses, including the youngest children, are asked to sign the wedding certificate as a record. In Great Britain, Quakers keep a separate record of the union and notify the [[General Register Office]].

In the early days of the United States, there was doubt whether a marriage solemnised in that manner was entitled to legal recognition. Over the years, each state has set rules for the procedure. Most US states expect the marriage document to be signed by a single officiant (a priest, rabbi, minister, Justice of the Peace, etc.). Quakers routinely modify the document to allow three or four Friends to sign as the officiant. Often, these are the members of a committee of ministry and oversight, who have helped the couple plan their marriage. Usually, a separate document containing their vows and the signatures of all present is kept by the couple, and often displayed prominently in their home.

In many Friends meetings, the couple meet with a [[clearness committee]] prior to the wedding. This committee's purpose is to discuss with the couple the many aspects of marriage and life as a couple. If the couple seems ready, the marriage is recommended to the meeting.

As in the wider society, there is a wide diversity of views on the issue of [[same-sex marriage]], and Friends have varying views on the topic. Various Friends meetings around the world have voiced support for, and have recognised, same-sex marriages. In 1986, Hartford Friends Meeting in Connecticut, U.S., reached the decision that "the Meeting recognised a committed union in a celebration of marriage, under the care of the Meeting. The same loving care and consideration should be given to both homosexual and heterosexual applicants as outlined in Faith and Practice."<ref name="religioustolerance.org">{{cite web|url=http://www.religioustolerance.org/hom_quak.htm|title=The Society of Friends (Quakers) and Homosexuality|accessdate=5 May 2015}}</ref> Since then, some other meetings of liberal and progressive Friends from Australia, Britain, New Zealand, parts of North America, and other countries have recognised marriage between partners of the same sex. In jurisdictions, where same-sex marriage is not recognised by the civil authorities, some meetings follow the practice of early Quakers in overseeing the union without reference to the state. There are also Friends who do not support same-sex marriage, and some Evangelical and Pastoral yearly meetings in the United States have issued public statements stating that homosexuality is a sin.<ref name="religioustolerance.org"/>

==National and international divisions and organisation==
Like many religious movements, the Religious Society of Friends has evolved, changed, and split into subgroups.

Quakerism started in [[England and Wales]], and quickly spread to Ireland, the Netherlands,<ref name=Netherlands /> Barbados<ref name=Barbados /> and North America. Today [[Kenya]] is, by far, the country with the most Quakers. Other countries with over 5,000 Quakers are Burundi, Bolivia, Canada, Guatemala, Nepal, Taiwan, Uganda, United Kingdom, and the United States.<ref name="FWCC2012"/> Although the total number of Quakers is around 377,000 worldwide,<ref name="FWCC2012"/> Quaker influence is concentrated in [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]]; [[Kaimosi]], Kenya; [[Newberg, Oregon]]; [[Greenleaf, Idaho]]; [[Whittier, California]]; [[Richmond, Indiana]]; [[Friendswood, Texas]]; [[Birmingham]], England; [[Ramallah]], Palestine, and [[Greensboro, North Carolina]].

{{Main article|Religious Society of Friends in Africa}}

The highest concentration of Quakers is in Africa.<ref name="Qworldstats">43 percent of Quakers worldwide are found in Africa, versus 30 percent in North America, 17 percent in Latin America, and the Caribbean, 6 percent in Europe, and 4 percent in Asia/West Pacific. See [http://www.quakerinfo.org/resources/worldstats.html ''Quaker Information Center''].</ref> The Friends of East Africa were at one time part of a single East Africa Yearly Meeting, then the world's largest yearly meeting. Today, this region is served by several distinct yearly meetings. Most of these are affiliated with the [[Friends United Meeting]], practise programmed worship and employ pastors. Friends meet in Rwanda and Burundi, as well as new work beginning in North Africa. Small unprogrammed meetings exist also in Botswana, Ghana, Lesotho, Namibia, Nigeria, South Africa and Zimbabwe.

In 2012, there were 196,800 adult Quakers in Africa.<ref name="FWCC2012" />

Friends in Australia and New Zealand follow the unprogrammed tradition, similar to [[Britain Yearly Meeting]].

Considerable distances between the colonies and small numbers of Quakers meant that Australia Friends were dependent on London until the 20th century. The Society remained unprogrammed and is named Australia Yearly Meeting, with local organizations around seven Regional Meetings: Canberra (which extends into southern New South Wales), New South Wales, Queensland, South Australia (which extends into Northern Territory), Tasmania, Victoria, and Western Australia.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.quakers.org.au/|title=Religious Society of Friends (Quakers) in Australia Inc.|accessdate=5 May 2015}}</ref> [[The Friends' School, Hobart|The Friends' School]] is found in [[Hobart]]. An annual meeting each January, is hosted by a different Regional Meeting over a seven-year cycle, with a Standing Committee each July or August. The Australia Yearly Meeting published This We Can Say: Australian Quaker Life, Faith and Thought, in 2003.

Meetings for worship in New Zealand started in [[Nelson, New Zealand|Nelson]] in 1842, and in [[Auckland]] in 1885. In 1889 it was estimated that there were about 30 Quakers in Auckland.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/AS18890417.2.17?query=Ellerslie%20Racecourse%20platform|accessdate=10 May 2017|title=Auckland Star|date=17 April 1889|publisher=Auckland Star}}</ref> The New Zealand Yearly Meeting, today consists of nine monthly meetings.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://quaker.org.nz/structure-of-the-society-of-friends|title=Structure of the Society of Friends|accessdate=5 May 2015}}</ref> The Yearly Meeting published Quaker Faith and Practice in Aotearoa New Zealand, in 2003.

Middle East Yearly Meeting has meetings in [[Lebanon]] and [[State of Palestine|Palestine]]. 
There has been an active and vibrant Palestinian Quaker community in [[Ramallah]] since the late 1800s. In 1910 this community built the Ramallah Friends Meetinghouse and later added another building that was used for community outreach.

The Ramallah Friends Meeting has always played a vital role in the community. In 1948 the buildings and grounds became the home to many Palestinian refugees. Throughout the years, the members of the Ramallah Friends Meeting organised numerous community programmes such as the Children's Play Centre, the First Day School, and women's activities.

By the early 1990s the Meetinghouse and Annex, which housed meeting rooms and bathroom facilities, fell into disrepair as a result of damage inflicted by time and impact of conflict. So serious was the deterioration of the meetinghouse that by the middle 1990s it was impossible to use the building at all.

A further blow to the Friends and the wider Palestinian community was the high level of emigration brought on by the economic situation and the hardships arising from the continuing Israeli military occupation. The Meetinghouse, which had served as a place of worship for the Friends in Ramallah could no longer be used as such and the Annex could no longer be used for community outreach.

In 2002 a committee consisting of members of the Religious Society of Friends in the US and the Clerk of the Ramallah Meeting began to raise funds for the renovations of the buildings and grounds of the Meetinghouse. By November 2004 the renovations were complete, and on 6 March 2005, exactly 95 years to the day after the dedication, the Meetinghouse and Annex were rededicated as a Quaker and community resource.

Friends meet every Sunday morning at 10:30&nbsp;a.m. for unprogrammed Meeting for Worship. Everyone is welcome to attend.{{Clear right}}

Quakers can be found throughout Canada. Some of the largest concentrations are in Southern Ontario.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}

Friends in the United States have diverse worship styles and differences of theology, vocabulary, and practice.

A local [[wikt:congregation|congregation]] in the unprogrammed tradition is called a ''meeting'', or a ''monthly meeting'' (e.g., ''Smalltown Meeting'' or ''Smalltown Monthly Meeting''). The reference to "monthly" is because the meeting meets monthly to conduct the group's business. Most "monthly meetings" meet for worship at least once a week; some meetings have several worship meetings during the week. In programmed traditions, local congregations are often referred to as "Friends Churches".

Monthly meetings are often part of a regional group called a ''quarterly meeting'', which is usually part of an even larger group called a ''yearly meeting;'' with the adjectives "quarterly" and "yearly" referring specifically to the frequency of ''meetings for worship with a concern for business''.

Some yearly meetings belong to larger organisations to help maintain order and communication within the Society. The three chief ones are [[Friends General Conference]] (FGC), [[Friends United Meeting]] (FUM), and [[Evangelical Friends Church International]] (EFCI). In all three groups, most member organisations, though not necessarily members are from the United States. FGC is theologically the most liberal of the three groups, while EFCI is the most evangelical. FUM is the largest. [[Friends United Meeting]] was originally known as "Five Years Meeting". Some monthly meetings belong to more than one larger organisation, while others are fully independent.

==Relations with other churches and faiths==
===Ecumenical relations===
Many Quakers prior to the 20th century, considered the Religious Society of Friends to be a Christian movement, but did not feel that their religious faith fit within the categories of [[Catholicism|Catholic]], [[Eastern Christianity|Orthodox]], or [[Protestantism|Protestant]].<ref name=BBCreligion&ethics/> Many Conservative Friends, while fully seeing themselves as orthodox Christians, choose to remain separate from other Christian groups.

Many Friends in Liberal Friends' meetings are actively involved in the [[ecumenism|ecumenical movement]], often working closely with other [[Mainline Protestant]] and liberal Christian churches, with whom they share common religious ground. A concern for peace and social justice often brings Friends together with other Christian churches and other Christian groups. Some Liberal Quaker yearly meetings are members of ecumenical pan-Christian organisations, which include Protestant, Orthodox, and [[Anglicanism|Anglican]] churches—for example [[Philadelphia Yearly Meeting]] is a member of the [[National Council of Churches]].<ref name="ncccusa1">{{cite web |url=http://www.ncccusa.org/members/index.html |title=Members of the National Council of Churches |publisher=Ncccusa.org |accessdate=14 November 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111125143317/http://www.ncccusa.org/members/index.html |archivedate=25 November 2011  }}</ref> [[Britain Yearly Meeting]] is a member of [[Churches Together in Britain and Ireland]], and [[Friends General Conference]] is a member of the [[World Council of Churches]].<ref name="oikoumene1">{{cite web |url=http://www.oikoumene.org/en/member-churches/church-families/friends-quakers.html |title=Friends (Quakers) |publisher=Oikoumene.org |accessdate=14 November 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111104180955/http://www.oikoumene.org/en/member-churches/church-families/friends-quakers.html |archivedate=4 November 2011  }}</ref>

Guerneyite Friends would typically see themselves as part of an orthodox Christian movement and work closely with other Christian groups. [[Friends United Meeting]] (the international organisation of Gurneyite yearly meetings) is a member of the [[National Council of Churches]]<ref name="ncccusa1"/> and the [[World Council of Churches]],<ref name="oikoumene1"/> which are pan-Christian organisations, which include Protestant, Orthodox, and Anglican churches.

Evangelical Friends work closely with other [[evangelism|evangelical churches]] from other Christian traditions. The North American branch of [[Evangelical Friends Church International]] is a member church of the [[National Association of Evangelicals]]. Evangelical Friends tend to be less involved with non-evangelical churches and are not members of the [[World Council of Churches]] or [[National Council of Churches]].

The majority of other Christian groups recognise Friends among their fellow-Christians.<ref name=BBCreligion&ethics/> Some people who attend Quaker Meetings assume that Quakers are not Christians, when they do not hear overtly Christian language during the meeting for worship.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/belief/2010/mar/18/quaker-religion-jesus-christianity |title=If Quakers were more Christian |work=The Guardian |date=16 July 2008 |accessdate=14 November 2011}}</ref>

===Relations with other faiths===
Relationships between Quakers and non-Christians vary considerably, according to sect, geography, and history.

Early Quakers distanced themselves from practices that they saw as [[pagan]], such as by refusing to use the usual names of days of the week, since they derive from names of pagan deities.<ref>{{cite book|last=Yount|first=David|title=How the Quakers invented America|year=2007|publisher=Rowman & Littlefield Publishers Inc|isbn=0-7425-5833-9|page=11}}</ref> They refused to celebrate [[Christmas]] because they believed it was based on pagan festivities.<ref>{{cite book|last=Frost|first=Jerry William|title=The Quaker family in colonial America: a social history of the Society of Friends, Volume 2|year=1968|publisher=University of Wisconsin|location=Madison, Wisconsin|page=436}}</ref>

Early Friends attempted to convert adherents of other world religions to Christianity. For example, George Fox wrote a number of open letters to [[Jew]]s and [[Muslim]]s, in which he encouraged them to turn to Jesus Christ as the only path to salvation (e.g. ''A Visitation to the Jews'',<ref>{{cite web|last=Fox|first=George|title=A Visitation to the Jews. From Them Whom The Lord Hath Visited From on High, Among Whom He Hath Performed His Promise Made To Abraham, Isaac, And Jacob.

In 1870, Richard Price Hallowell argued that the logical extension of Christian Quakerism is a universal Church, which ''demands a religion which embraces Jew, Pagan and Christian, and which cannot be limited by the dogmas of one or the other''.<ref name=Hollowell1870/>

Since the late 20th century, some attenders at Liberal Quaker Meetings have actively identified with world faiths other than Christianity, such as [[Judaism]], [[Islam]],<ref name=makingmuslimquaker/> [[Buddhism]]<ref name=mindfulquaker/> and [[Paganism (contemporary)|Paganism]].
