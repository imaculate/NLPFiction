'''Susquehannock''' people, also called the '''Conestoga''' by the English,<ref name="AmHeritageBk2">The American Heritage Book of Indians, pages 188-189</ref> were [[Iroquoian languages|Iroquoian-speaking]] [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]] who lived in areas adjacent to the [[Susquehanna River]] and its [[Tributary|tributaries]] ranging from its upper reaches in the southern part of what is now [[New York (state)|New York]] (near the lands of the [[Iroquois|Five Nations]] of the [[Iroquois Confederacy]]), through eastern and central [[Pennsylvania]] West of the [[Poconos]] and the upper [[Delaware River]] (and the [[Delaware nation]]s), with lands extending beyond the mouth of the Susquehanna in [[Maryland]] along the west bank of the [[Potomac River|Potomac]]<ref>Henry George Hahn, Carl Behm, ''Towson: A Pictorial History of a Maryland Town'', pgs. 12-13, Baltimore, MD: Donning Co., 1977, {{ISBN|0-915442-36-1}}</ref>  at the north end of the [[Chesapeake Bay]]. Evidence of their habitation has also been found in northern [[West Virginia]] and portions of southwestern Pennsylvania, which could be reached via the [[gaps of the Allegheny]] or several counties to the south, via the [[Cumberland Narrows]] pass which held the [[Nemacolin Trail]]. Both passes abutted their range and could be reached through connecting valleys from the [[West Branch Susquehanna]] and their large settlement at [[Conestoga, Pennsylvania]].

==Language==
{{Main|Susquehannock language }}
Susquehannock were an [[Iroquoian]]-speaking people and little of the Susquehannock language has been preserved, but this fact alone<ref name="AmHeritageBk"/> announces they were at odds with the Algonquian-speaking [[Delaware people]]s to the east.<ref name="AmHeritageBk"/> The chief source is a ''Vocabula Mahakuassica'' compiled by the Swedish [[missionary]] [[John Campanius|Johannes Campanius]] during the 1640s. Campanius' vocabulary contains about 100 words, and is sufficient to show that Susquehannock was a northern [[Iroquoian]] language, closely related to those of the [[Iroquois|Five Nations]].<ref name="AmHeritageBk"/><ref name="Marianne Mithun 1981"/> Unfortunately peace with the Iroquois was as elusive to the tribe as it was with the Delaware.<ref name="AmHeritageBk"/>
[[File:Depiction of a Susquehannock on the Smith Map (1624).jpg|thumb|left|Depiction of a Susquehannock on the Smith Map (1624). The handwritten caption reads (in modern English): "The Susquehannocks are a giant-like people and thus attired."]]
Europeans penetrated the interior from the coastal areas dominated by Algonquian-speaking tribes, they usually learned the names of new tribes by what the first groups called them. This is particularly true for the Susquehannock, who lived amidst rival peoples who were generally hostile, then after a brief period of contact with Europeans, fell drastically from history's stage to overwhelming depopulation<ref name="AmHeritageBk"/> due to epidemic disease&mdash;a reality which affected the indigenous peoples of what are now known as "the Americas".<ref name="AmHeritageBk"/>

== Names and endonym ==
The Europeans adapted or transliterated these names according to their own languages and spelling systems, trying to capture the sounds of the names.

*[[Wyandot people|Huron]], another Iroquoian-speaking people, called these people ''Andastoerrhonon'', meaning "people of the blackened ridge pole", related to their building practices.<ref name=Wallace>Wallace: ''Indians in Pennsylvania''</ref>);
* The French adapted the Huron term and called them the ''Andaste'' (Andastes in plural);
* The [[Lenape|Lenape/Delaware]], an [[Algonquian languages|Algonquian]] people, used an [[ethnonym]] for their traditional enemy, ''Mengwe'', which meant "without penis"<ref>Brinton, 81</ref> or ''Miqui'', which means "foreign, different, far off."<ref>Brinton, 85</ref> the [[Netherlands|Dutch]] and [[Sweden|Swedes]] derived their term of ''Minquas'' for the people from this term. The Lenape also used the term ''Sisawehak Hanna Len'' or "Oyster River People."<ref>Brinton, 132</ref> 
* The [[Powhatan language|Powhatan]]-speaking peoples of coastal Virginia (also Algonquian) called the tribe the ''Sasquesahanough.'' 
* The [[English (people)|English]] of [[Maryland]] and [[Virginia]] transliterated the Powhatan term, referring to the people as the ''Susquehannock.''
* The English of [[Pennsylvania]] in the late eighteenth century called them the Conestoga,<ref name="AmHeritageBk"/> derived from one of their few remaining villages in Pennsylvania known as [[Conestoga Town]]. Its name was based on the Iroquoian term, ''Kanastoge'', possibly meaning "place of the upright pole."<ref name="Marianne Mithun 1981">Marianne Mithun. 1981.

== History ==
[[File:New_Netherland_%27NOVI_BELGII_NOVAEQUE_ANGLIAE_NEC_NON_PARTIS_VIRGINIAE_TABULA%27.jpg|thumb|400px|Map of [[New Netherland]] & [[New Sweden]], whose Europeans were most in contact with the Susquehannock Peoples before their sudden fall from power ca. 1670-1672. The British experiences in the [[Baltimore]] were mostly negative, as the colony fought a war with the tribe.]]

According to recorded histories, the Susquehannocks told Europeans that they originally came from a large river valley to the west. Europeans who wrote this down seemed to assume that the Mississippi River was meant, however no Iroquoian people have ever been found in the Archaeological records of the region. Iroquoian peoples were, however, believed to have held a much larger region of Ohio at some point between the 13th & 16th centuries, when European colonization began. They also, however, claimed to have joined with other peoples once east of Appalachia to form their nation. Studying the linguistics of recorded examples of the Susquehannock language, it appears to have been closely related to that of the Onondaga.<ref name="Marianne Mithun 1981"/> It is most likely that both are correct.<ref>http://www.hsobc.org/on-the-susquehannocks-natives-having-previously-used-what-is-now-baltimore-county-as-hunting-grounds/</ref> Similar to how the [[Iroquois Confederacy]] was organized, there were said to be several distinct tribes of the Susquehannock. Capital towns were named by John Smith as Attock, Quadroque, Tesinigh & Utehowig.<ref>http://www.pa-roots.com/clearfield/earlyindianhistory/earlyindianhistory.html</ref>

{{One source|section|date=May 2018}}

The original population of the Susquehannock is uncertain due to lack of contact with the Europeans, whose records provide such data. The Europeans' best guesses are that the tribe numbered from 5000-7000 in 1600, and that the Susquehannock were a regional power capable of holding off the Iroquois Confederacy<ref name="AmHeritageBk"/> in the first seven decades of the 17th century, including after the Iroquois began systematic warfare against neighboring ethnic groups in pursuit of acquiring firearms during fur trading.<ref name="AmHeritageBk"/> Before that time, it was the inland Susquehannock who had allied themselves to Dutch and Swedish traders (1600 & 1610) and Swedish settlers in [[New Sweden]] around-1640 who had a monopoly on European [[flintlock]] [[firearms]], increasing the tribe's power.<ref
 name="AmHeritageBk"/> These firearms were ''carefully not traded'' to Iroquois or Delaware<ref name="AmHeritageBk"/> until the defeats of the Dutch<ref name=AngloD>English conquest of [[New Netherlands]] in 1667 imposed British control over the entire Atlantic Seaboard from Georgia to [[New France]]. see: [[Second Anglo-Dutch War]]</ref> imposed British traders, who initially favored the Iroquois,<ref name="AmHeritageBk"/> into the North American Amerindian tribal rivalries and also kept firearms away from the more coastally located Delaware peoples.
 
The Susquehannock, who were all but extinct by the time the British asserted any significant local control, had early on allied with the Swedes, who traded them firearms for furs as early as the 1610s but now found themselves generally often at odds with the new European managers of Maryland and Pennsylvania. Consequently, the nation also fought a war ''declared by'' the [[Province of Maryland]]<ref name="AmHeritageBk"/> from 1642-50s and won it, albeit with help from their long-time allies the Swedes.

When they found the English [[fur trade]]rs would supply the coveted firearms for [[Beaver|beaver skins]] during the mid-17th-century the Iroquois Confederacy began warring against rival nations in order to monopolize the richest fur bearing streams.<ref name="AmHeritageBk"/> When they attempted to impose their will upon the Susquehannock circa 1666, the Susquehannock badly defeated the combined forces of the [[Seneca nation]] and [[Cayuga nation]] of the [[Five Nations of the Iroquois]],<ref name="AmHeritageBk"/> severely damaging the southern populations of both these eastern Iroquois tribes.<ref
 name="AmHeritageBk"/> Earlier, the Susquehannock peoples may have decimated bands of the Delaware in the greater [[Delaware River|central Delaware Valley]] region,<ref name="AmHeritageBk"/> including raids in force across the Delaware into what is now central [[New Jersey]], who had, in the event, became a tributary nation following a war with the fierce Susquehannock before 1640.<ref name="AmHeritageBk"/> These dramatic swings in local Indigenous power and population indicate the Susquehannock practiced a form of ruthless total war beyond simple raiding.{{Citation needed|date=May 2018}}

But following the zenith of their tribal power in the early 1670s,<ref name="AmHeritageBk"/> the Susquehannock suffered an extremely rapid decline mid-decade in population and power,<ref name="AmHeritageBk"/> - presumably from [[infectious disease]]s such as smallpox, which also decimated other Native American groups such as the [[Mohawk people|Mohawk]] and other Iroquois.<ref name="AmHeritageBk"/> Drastically weakened by their losses, they were overwhelmed within a couple of years by the balance of the Iroquois by 1678,<ref name="AmHeritageBk"/> though some small groups are believed to have fled west via the [[gaps of the Allegheny]] into Western Pennsylvania or beyond into the [[Ohio Country]], possibly becoming absorbed by the [[Shawnee]].<ref name="AmHeritageBk"/> Their numbers in their [[Susquehanna Valley]] homeland may have diminished to as few as about 300 in 1700 with another remnant group well to the west in the Allegheny settlement the English called the ''Conestoga people'' near [[Conestoga, Pennsylvania]].<ref name="AmHeritageBk"/> Before the American Revolution, in mis-targeted response to rumors that they were supporting [[Pontiac's War]], the Native Americans living in Conestoga were massacred by the [[Paxton Boys]].

==Society==
The Susquehannock society was a confederacy of up to 20 smaller tribes, who occupied scattered villages along the Susquehanna River. The Susquehannock nation remained independent and not part of any confederacy into the 1600s. Ultimately, they were not strong enough to withstand the competition from colonists and other tribes in their piece of the so-called [[Beaver Wars]] of that century.<ref>Dean R. Snow, ''The Archaeology of North America'', Pearson, 2009</ref> About 1677 their remaining people, decimated by disease and war, merged with their former enemies and distant language kin, the [[Haudenosaunee]] ([[Iroquois]]) Five Nations, based in New York.
 
Archeological materials have been found in Pennsylvania, and Maryland's [[Allegany County, Maryland|Allegany County]] at the Barton (18AG3) and Llewellyn (18AG26) sites. [[West Virginia]]'s [[Grant County, West Virginia|Grant]], [[Hampshire County, West Virginia|Hampshire]] and [[Hardy County|Hardy]] counties region (Brashler 1987) also have archaeological sites where Susquehannock ceramics have been found.

[[Archeologists]] have also found evidence of this people along the [[Potomac River]] and its tributaries. They have classified these [[Artifact (archaeology)|artifacts]] as the "late Susquehannock sequence". A [[Contact Period]] (1550~1630) Susquehanna site, 46Hy89,<ref>[http://cwva.org/protohistoric/moorefield.htm "Susquehannock, Images from Moorefield Village Site 46Hy89"], Council for West Virginia Archaeology</ref><ref>[http://cwva.org/protohistoric/bibliographies/moorefield_biblio.htm Maymon, Jeffery H. and Thomas W. Davis (1998), "A Contact Period Susquehannock Site in the Upper Potomac River Drainage: Data Recovery at Site 46HY89, Moorefield, West Virginia"], Abstract of paper presented at the 28th Annual Meeting of the Middle Atlantic Archaeological Conference, [[Cape May, New Jersey]].</ref> is located in the [[Eastern Panhandle]] at [[Moorefield, West Virginia]].<ref>Brashler, J.G. 1987. "A Middle 16th Century Susquehannock Village in Hampshire County, West Virginia," ''West Virginia Archeologist'' 39(2): 1-30.</ref>

The English seldom visited the upper Susquehanna inland region during the early colonial period. It is likely that the Susquehannock had occupied the same lands for several hundred years. When Captain [[John Smith of Jamestown]] met them in 1608, they had a formidable village in the lower river valley (present-day [[Lancaster, Pennsylvania]] developed near here.) Captain Smith wrote of the Susquehannock, 
"They can make neere 600 able and mighty men, and are pallisadoed [palisaded] in their Townes to defend them from the Massawomekes, their mortall enimies."<ref name=NEV>{{cite web|last1=TYLER|first1=LYON GARDINER|title=NARRATIVES OF EARLY VIRGINIA 1606 — 1625|url=https://archive.org/stream/narrativesofearl1946tyle/narrativesofearl1946tyle_djvu.txt|website=Internet Archive|publisher=BARNES & NOBLE, 1907|accessdate=28 July 2015}}</ref> He was astonished to find the Susquehannock were brokering trade with [[New France|French]] goods. He estimated the population of their village to be 2,000, although he never visited it.

The French explorer [[Samuel Champlain]] noted the Susquehannock in his ''Voyages of Samuel Champlain''; in 1615, he called one of their 20 villages, ''Carantouan''. It was located on the upper [[Susquehanna River]] near present-day [[New York (state)|New York]] state. It rallied more than 800 warriors with two other villages, Champlain reported.

Modern estimates of the total Susquehannock population, including the whole territory in 1600, range as high as 7,000 people. During the sixteenth century and carrying forward into the first decades of colonization, the Susquehannock were the most numerous people in the Susquehanna Valley.

During the early Dutch colonization of [[New Netherland]], the Susquehannock traded furs with the Europeans. As early as 1623, they struggled to go north past the [[Lenape]] (later known as the Delaware), who occupied territory along the [[Delaware River]], to trade with the Dutch at [[New Amsterdam]]. In 1634, the Susquehannock defeated the Delaware in that area, who may have become their [[Tributary state|tributaries]].

[[File:NouvSuede.jpg|thumb|New Sweden - encounter between Swedish colonists and the natives of Delaware]]
In 1638, Swedish settlers established [[New Sweden]] in the [[Delaware Valley]] near the coast. Their location near the bay enabled them to interrupt the Susquehannock [[fur trade]] with the Dutch further north along the coast.

In 1642, the English [[Province of Maryland]] declared war on the Susquehannock. With the help of the Swedes, the Susquehannock defeated the English in 1644. The Susquehannock were in an intermittent state of war with Maryland until 1652. As a result, they traded almost exclusively with New Sweden to the north.

In 1652 the Susquehannock concluded a peace treaty with Maryland. In return for arms and safety on their southern flank, they ceded to Maryland large territories on both shores of the [[Chesapeake Bay]]. This decision was also related to the [[Beaver Wars]] of the late 1650s, in which the ''[[Haudenosaunee]]'' swept south and west against other tribes and territories to expand their hunting grounds for the fur trade. With the help of Maryland's arms, the Susquehannock fought off the [[Iroquois]] Confederacy for a time, and a brief peace followed.

In 1658, the Susquehannock used their influence with the [[Esopus tribe|Esopus]] to end the [[Esopus Wars]], because that conflict interfered with their important trade with the Dutch. From 1658 to 1662, the Susquehannock were at war with the powerful Iroquois confederacy based south of the Great Lakes, which was seeking new hunting grounds for the fur trade. By 1661, the Maryland colonists and the Susquehannock had expanded their peace treaty into a full alliance against the Iroquois. Fifty Englishmen were assigned to the Susquehannock to guard their fort.

In 1663, the Susquehannock defeated a large Iroquois invasion force. In April 1663, the Susquehannock village on the upper [[Ohio River]] was attacked by [[Seneca people|Seneca]], [[Cayuga people|Cayuga]], and [[Onondaga people|Onondaga]] warriors of the western Iroquois. (JR: 48:7-79, NYCD 12:431).

In 1669-70, [[John Lederer]] was guided by a Susquehanna man on his journey to southwest [[Virginia]] and [[North Carolina]] (Mooney 1894:32). Paul A. W. Wallace writes, "In 1669 Iroquois Indians warned the French that if they tried to descend the [[Ohio River]] they would be in danger from the "Andastes." (Susquesahanocks: Wallace 1961:13).

In 1672, the Susquehannock defeated another Iroquois war party. The Iroquois appealed to the French for support because the Iroquois could not "defend themselves if the others came to attack them in their villages".  Some old histories indicate that the Iroquois ultimately defeated the Susquehannock, but no record of a defeat has been found.<ref>Jennings, p. 135</ref> In 1675 the Susquehannock suffered a major defeat by the Iroquois League. English colonists invited the tribe to resettle in Maryland, where they relocated across the river from Pennsylvania.

But the Susquehannock suffered from getting caught up in [[Bacon's Rebellion]] the following year.<ref>Waldman, ''Native American Tribes'', p. 286</ref> After some [[Doeg (tribe)|Doeg]] Indians killed some Virginians, surviving colonists crossed into Maryland and killed Susquehannock in retaliation. The Susquehannock moved to old [[Fort Piscataway]], below present-day [[Washington, DC]]. Problems on the frontiers led to the mobilization of the militias of Maryland and Virginia and, in confusion, they surrounded the peaceful Susquehannock village. When five Susquehannock chiefs came out to negotiate, they were murdered. The Susquehannock slipped out of the fort at night and harassed settlers in Virginia and Maryland, then eventually returned to the area of the Susquehanna River.

===Covenant Chain Treaty===
In one of its treaties with the colonies, in 1676 the Iroquois reached peace with Maryland and Virginia, and the Lenape/Delaware. They offered to shelter the Susquehannock, distant relations through the Iroquoian-language family, and sometimes allies.<ref name="AmHeritageBk"/>

Around 1677, most of the remaining Susquehannock moved to New York, joining mostly with the Seneca and Onondaga nations, who also spoke Iroquoian languages. The Iroquois, who had a longer tradition of adopting defeated enemies into their tribe,<ref name="AmHeritageBk"/> and Governor [[Edmund Andros]] of the [[Province of New York]] told the Susquehannock they would be welcome in New York and protected from Maryland and Virginia. Some returned to their homeland on the southern shores of the [[Susquehanna River]], keeping their distance from the center of Iroquois power. Others moved to the upper Delaware River into the somewhat depopulated [[Delaware Nation]] lands (ravaged both by the Susquehannock who had made them tributary and the Iroquois, which had competed with the Algonquian-speaking peoples), where they lived under the protection of New York.

After adopting the majority of the Susquehannock, the Iroquois acquired a right to most of the territory along Susquehanna River, but they never claimed below the [[Atlantic Seaboard fall line|Fall Line]]. To the southwest, the remnant Susquehannock merged with the [[Meherrin]], and allied [[Nottoway Tribe|Nottoway]] or Mangoac, the Iroquoian-speaking tribes of Virginia. The new group called themselves ''Chiroe<sup>n</sup>haka,'' according to the 20th-century ethnologist [[James Mooney]]. As of 2009, researchers have found archaeological evidence of Susquehannock movement into and habitation of areas such as the [[Seneca Rocks|Mouth of the Seneca]]<ref>(46Pd1)</ref> and [[Pancake, West Virginia|Pancake]] Island<ref>(46Hm73)</ref> villages in present-day West Virginia, according to Bryan Ward, West Virginia Division of Culture and History.

The Susquehannock population had been devastated by high fatalities from new Eurasian [[infectious diseases]], to which they had no [[immunity (medical)|immunity]], followed by warfare. About 1697, a few hundred surviving Susquehannock settled in a new village in [[Lancaster County, Pennsylvania]] called [[Conestoga Town]]. The river was named for them as the [[Conestoga River]] under Governor [[William Penn]]. A type of wagon was named for them that was later used by pioneers migrating west. Hardware kits for them were made on the east side of the Alleghenies.

The remnants of the Susquehannock lived under the protection of the provincial Pennsylvania government, but their population declined steadily. In 1763, a census counted twenty-two people in Conestoga Town. That year the [[Paxton Boys]], in response to [[Pontiac's Rebellion]] on the western frontier, attacked the village,<ref name="ssp"/> killing six people. The remaining Indians were sheltered in a Lancaster workhouse by the Commonwealth. The governor discouraged further violence, but two weeks later, the Paxton Boys killed the 14 Susquehannock at the workhouse.<ref name="ssp">{{cite web|title=Susquehannock State Park|url=http://www.dcnr.state.pa.us/stateparks/findapark/susquehannock/index.htm|work=Susquehannock State Park|publisher=Pennsylvania Department of Conservation and Natural Resources|accessdate=2011-10-20}}</ref>

In the early 1700s, other remnant Susquehannock migrated to Ohio, where they merged with other tribes, becoming known as the [[Mingo]]. The tribe became extinct, although descendants survived and intermarried.<ref name="ssp"/>
