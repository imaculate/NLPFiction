University of Pennsylvania considers itself the fourth-oldest institution of higher education in the United States though this is contested by Princeton and Columbia Universities.<ref group="note">Penn is the fourth-oldest using the founding dates claimed by each institution. The College of Philadelphia (later Penn), [[Princeton University|College of New Jersey (later Princeton University)]] and [[Columbia University|King's College (later Columbia College, now Columbia University)]] all originated within a few years of each other. After initially designating 1750 as its founding date, Penn later considered 1749 to be its founding date for more than a century, including alumni observing a centennial celebration in 1849. In 1895, several elite universities in the United States convened in New York City as the "Intercollegiate Commission" at the invitation of [[John James McCook (lawyer)|John J. McCook]], a [[Union Army]] officer during the [[American Civil War]] and member of Princeton's board of trustees who chaired its Committee on Academic Dress. The primary purpose of the conference was to standardize American academic regalia, which was accomplished through the adoption of the [[Academic regalia in the United States|Intercollegiate Code on Academic Costume]]. This formalized protocol included a provision that henceforth [[academic procession]]s would place visiting dignitaries and other officials in the order of their institution's founding dates. The following year, Penn's ''The Alumni Register'' magazine, published by the General Alumni Society, began a campaign to retroactively revise the University's founding date to 1740, in order to become older than Princeton, which had been chartered in 1746. Three years later in 1899, Penn's board of trustees acceded to this alumni initiative and officially changed its founding date from 1749 to 1740, affecting its rank in academic processions as well as the informal bragging rights that come with the age-based hierarchy in academia generally. See [http://www.upenn.edu/gazette/0902/thomas.html Building Penn's Brand] for more details on why Penn did this.  Princeton implicitly challenges this rationale, [https://www.princeton.edu/main/about/history/] also considering itself to be the nation's fourth oldest institution of higher learning. [https://www.princeton.edu/main/about/history/american-revolution/] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160403053852/http://www.princeton.edu/main/about/history/american-revolution/ |date=April 3, 2016 }} To further complicate the comparison, a [[University of Edinburgh]]-educated [[Presbyterian]] minister from Scotland, named [[William Tennent]] and his son [[Gilbert Tennent]] operated a "[[Log College]]" in [[Bucks County, Pennsylvania]], from 1726 until 1746; some have suggested a connection between it and Princeton because five members of Princeton's first Board of Trustees were affiliated with the "Log College", including Gilbert Tennent, William Tennent, Jr., and Samuel Finley, the latter of whom later became President of Princeton.  All twelve members of Princeton's first Board of Trustees were leaders from the "[[The Old Side-New Side Controversy|New Side]]" or "[[Old and New Light|New Light]]" wing of the [[Presbyterian Church]] in the [[New Jersey]], [[New York (state)|New York]] and [[Pennsylvania]] areas.[https://www.princeton.edu/mudd/news/faq/topics/founders.shtml] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131105013448/http://www.princeton.edu/mudd/news/faq/topics/founders.shtml |date=November 5, 2013 }} This antecedent relationship, if considered a formal lineage with institutional continuity, would justify pushing Princeton's founding date back to 1726, earlier than Penn's 1740. However, Princeton has not done so, and a Princeton historian says that "the facts do not warrant" such an interpretation. {{cite web|url=http://etcweb1.princeton.edu/CampusWWW/Companion/log_college.html|title=Archived copy|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051117052303/http://etcweb1.princeton.edu/CampusWWW/Companion/log_college.html|archivedate=November 17, 2005|deadurl=yes|accessdate=January 30, 2006}} Columbia also implicitly challenges Penn's use of either 1750, 1749 or 1740, as it claims to be the fifth oldest institution of higher learning in the United States (after Harvard, William & Mary, Yale and Princeton), based upon its charter date of 1754 and Penn's charter date of 1755. [http://www.columbia.edu/content/history.html] Academic histories of American higher education generally list Penn as fifth or sixth, after Princeton and immediately before or after that of Columbia. [http://libx.bsu.edu/cdm4/document.php?CISOROOT=/ConspectusH&CISOPTR=345&REC=1] [http://scholarship.rice.edu/bitstream/handle/1911/9120/article_RI234246.pdf?sequence=5] [http://www.ideals.illinois.edu/bitstream/handle/2142/3878/gslisoccasionalpv00000i00140.pdf?sequence=1]

Even Penn's own account of its early history agrees that the original secondary school (the Academy of Philadelphia) did not add an institution of higher learning (the College of Philadelphia) until 1755, but university officials continue to make it their practice to assert their fourth-oldest place in academic processions. Other American universities which began as a colonial-era, early version of secondary schools such as [[St. John's College (Annapolis/Santa Fe)|St. John's College]] (founded as "King William's School" in 1696) and the [[University of Delaware]] (founded as "the Free Academy" in 1743) choose to march based upon the date they became institutions of higher learning.  Penn History Professor Edgar Potts Cheyney was a member of the Penn class of 1883 who played a leading role in the 1896-1899 alumni campaign to change the university's formal founding date.  According to Cheyney's later history of the event, the university did indeed consider its founding date to be 1749 for almost a century. However, it was changed with good reason, and primarily due to a publication about the university issued by the [[United States Secretary of Education|U.S. Commissioner of Education]] written by Francis Newton Thorpe, a fellow alumnus and colleague in the Penn history department. The year 1740 is the date of the establishment of the first educational trust that the University had taken upon itself. Cheyney states further that "it might be considered a lawyer's date; it is a familiar legal practice in considering the date of any institution to seek out the oldest trust it administers". He also points out that Harvard's founding date is also the year in which the [[Massachusetts General Court]] (state legislature) resolved to establish a fund in a year's time for a "School or College". As well, Princeton claims its founding date as 1746, the date of its first charter. However, the exact words of the charter are unknown, the number and names of the trustees in the charter are unknown, and no known original is extant. With the exception of Columbia University, the majority of the American Colonial Colleges do not have clear-cut dates of foundation (Edgar Potts Cheyney, "History of the University of Pennsylvania: 1740-1940", Philadelphia: University of Pennsylvania Press, 1940: pp. 45-52).</ref>  The university also considers itself as the [[first university in the United States]] with both undergraduate and graduate studies.

In 1740, a group of Philadelphians joined together to erect a great preaching hall for the traveling [[evangelism|evangelist]] [[George Whitefield]], who toured the American colonies delivering open air sermons. The building was designed and built by [[Edmund Woolley]] and was the largest building in the city at the time, drawing thousands of people the first time it was preached in.<ref name="MontgomeryHistory">{{cite book|title=[[:File:History of the University of Pennsylvania - Montgomery (1900).djvu|A History of the University of Pennsylvania from Its Foundation to A.

According to Franklin's autobiography, it was in 1743 when he first had the idea to establish an academy, "thinking the Rev. [[Richard Peters (priest)|Richard Peters]] a fit person to superintend such an institution". However, Peters declined a casual inquiry from Franklin and nothing further was done for another six years.<ref name="MontgomeryHistory"/>{{rp|30}} In the fall of 1749, now more eager to create a school to educate future generations, [[Benjamin Franklin]] circulated a pamphlet titled "[[commons:File:Proposals Relating to the Education of Youth in Pensilvania (UC) - Benjamin Franklin (1931 1749).djvu|Proposals Relating to the Education of Youth in Pensilvania]]", his vision for what he called a "Public Academy of Philadelphia".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.archives.upenn.edu/histy/genlhistory/brief.html|title=A Brief History of the University, University of Pennsylvania Archives|first=Steven Morgan|last=Friedman|publisher=Archives.upenn.edu|accessdate=December 9, 2010}}</ref> Unlike the other [[Colonial colleges]] that existed in 1749—[[Harvard University|Harvard]], [[College of William and Mary|William & Mary]], [[Yale]] and [[Princeton University|Princeton]]—Franklin's new school would not focus merely on education for the clergy. He advocated an innovative concept of higher education, one which would teach both the ornamental knowledge of the arts and the practical skills necessary for making a living and doing public service. The proposed program of study could have become the nation's first modern liberal arts curriculum, although it was never implemented because [[William Smith (Episcopalian priest)|William Smith]] (1727-1803), an [[Anglicanism|Anglican]] priest who became the first [[provost (education)|provost]] and other [[Board of Trustees|trustees]] strongly preferred the traditional curriculum.<ref name="Penn's Heritage">{{cite web|title=Penn's Heritage|url=http://www.upenn.edu/about/history|publisher=University of Pennsylvania|accessdate=May 8, 2016}}</ref><ref>N.

Franklin assembled a board of trustees from among the leading citizens of Philadelphia, the first such non-sectarian board in America. At the first meeting of the 24 members of the Board of Trustees (November 13, 1749), the issue of where to locate the school was a prime concern. Although a lot across Sixth Street from the old Pennsylvania State House (later renamed and famously known since 1776 as "[[Independence Hall (United States)|Independence Hall]]"), was offered without cost by [[James Logan (statesman)|James Logan]], its owner, the Trustees realized that the building erected in 1740, which was still vacant, would be an even better site. The original sponsors of the dormant building still owed considerable construction debts and asked Franklin's group to assume their debts and, accordingly, their inactive trusts. On February 1, 1750, the new board took over the building and trusts of the old board. On August 13, 1751, the "Academy of Philadelphia", using the great hall at 4th and Arch Streets, took in its first secondary students. A charity school also was chartered July 13, 1753<ref name="WoodHistory"/>{{rp|12}} in accordance with the intentions of the original "New Building" donors, although it lasted only a few years. On June 16, 1755, the "[[College of Philadelphia]]" was chartered, paving the way for the addition of undergraduate instruction.<ref name="WoodHistory"/>{{rp|13}} All three schools shared the same Board of Trustees and were considered to be part of the same institution.<ref name=autogenerated1/> The first commencement exercises were held on May 17, 1757.<ref name="WoodHistory"/>{{rp|14}}

The institution of higher learning was known as the College of Philadelphia from 1755 to 1779. In 1779, not trusting then-provost the [[William Smith (Episcopalian priest)|Reverend William Smith's]] [[Loyalist (American Revolution)|"Loyalist"]] tendencies, the revolutionary State Legislature created a [[University of the State of Pennsylvania]].<ref name=autogenerated1>{{cite web|title=Penn in the 18th Century, University of Pennsylvania Archives|url=http://www.archives.upenn.edu/histy/features/1700s/penn1700s.html|publisher=Universdity of Pennsylvania|accessdate=April 29, 2006}}</ref> The result was a schism, with Smith continuing to operate an attenuated version of the College of Philadelphia. In 1791, the Legislature issued a new charter, merging the two institutions into a new University of Pennsylvania with twelve men from each institution on the new Board of Trustees.<ref name=autogenerated1/>

Penn has three claims to being the [[first university in the United States]], according to university archives director Mark Frazier Lloyd: the 1765 founding of the first medical school in America<ref name=WDL1>{{cite web|title=University of Pennsylvania|url=http://www.wdl.org/en/item/9432|publisher=[[World Digital Library]]|accessdate=February 14, 2013}}</ref> made Penn the first institution to offer both "undergraduate" and professional education; the 1779 charter made it the first American institution of higher learning to take the name of "University"; and existing colleges were established as seminaries (although, as detailed earlier, Penn adopted a traditional seminary curriculum as well).<ref name="first university">{{cite web|url=http://www.archives.upenn.edu/histy/genlhistory/firstuniv.html|title=The University of Pennsylvania: America's First University|publisher=University Archives and Records Center, University of Pennsylvania|accessdate=April 29, 2006}}</ref>

After being located in downtown Philadelphia for more than a century, the campus was moved across the [[Schuylkill River]] to property purchased from the [[Blockley Almshouse]] in [[West Philadelphia]] in 1872, where it has since remained in an area now known as [[University City, Philadelphia|University City]]. Although Penn began operating as an academy or secondary school in 1751 and obtained its collegiate charter in 1755, it initially designated 1750 as its founding date; this is the year which appears on the first iteration of the university seal. Sometime later in its early history, Penn began to consider 1749 as its founding date and this year was referenced for over a century, including at the centennial celebration in 1849.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.archives.upenn.edu/histy/features/1700s/trustees.html|title=Penn Trustees 1749-1800|publisher=University of Pennsylvania University Archives|accessdate= July 23, 2013}}</ref> In 1899, the board of trustees voted to adjust the founding date earlier again, this time to 1740, the date of "the creation of the earliest of the many educational trusts the University has taken upon itself".<ref>{{cite book|title=History of the University of Pennsylvania 1740–1940|last=Cheyney|first=Edward Potts|authorlink=Edward Potts Cheyney|year=1940|publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press|location=Philadelphia|pages=46–48|url=http://repository.upenn.edu/penn_history/5/}} Cheyney was a Penn professor and alumnus from the class of 1883 who advocated the change in Penn's founding date in 1899 to appear older than both Princeton and Columbia.  The explanation, "It will have been noted that 1740 is the date of the creation of the earliest of the many educational trusts the University has taken upon itself," is Professor Cheyney's justification (pp. 47-48) for Penn retroactively changing its founding date, not language used by the Board of Trustees.</ref> The board of trustees voted in response to a three-year campaign by Penn's General Alumni Society to retroactively revise the university's founding date to appear older than Princeton University, which had been chartered in 1746.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.archives.upenn.edu/people/notables/alumpres.html|title=Presidents of Penn Alumni|website=www.archives.upenn.edu|access-date=August 24, 2016}}</ref>

===Early campuses===
The Academy of Philadelphia, a secondary school for boys, began operations in 1751 in an unused church building at 4th and Arch Streets which had sat unfinished and dormant for over a decade. Upon receiving a collegiate charter in 1755, the first classes for the College of Philadelphia were taught in the same building, in many cases to the same boys who had already graduated from The Academy of Philadelphia. In 1801, the University moved to the unused Presidential Mansion at 9th and Market Streets, a building that both George Washington and John Adams had declined to occupy while Philadelphia was the temporary national capital.<ref name="WoodHistory">{{cite book|lccn=07007833|OCLC=760190902|title=[[:s:en:The History of the University of Pennsylvania|The History of the University of Pennsylvania, from Its Origin to the Year 1827]]|publisher= McCarty and Davis|author=Wood, George Bacon|authorlink=George Bacon Wood|year=1834}}</ref> Classes were held in the mansion until 1829, when it was demolished. Architect [[William Strickland (architect)|William Strickland]] designed twin buildings on the same site, College Hall and Medical Hall (both 1829–1830), which formed the core of the Ninth Street Campus until Penn's move to West Philadelphia in the 1870s.

===Evolution from commuter school to residential university===

Before World War II, Penn was predominantly a regional school, with many faculty, students and staff residing in the Philadelphia area. As a founding member of the Ivy League in 1954, Penn increased its national stature, but, more importantly, began to focus on serving the nation as a whole, rather than existing as a regional institution.<ref>https://www.archives.upenn.edu/histy/genlhistory/pa_album/ch10.pdf</ref> However, the physical campus was in need of significant capital improvement. <ref>https://www.archives.upenn.edu/histy/features/upwphil/sudow_thesis.pdf</ref>

After World War II, Penn began a capital spending program in order to overhaul its campus, especially student housing. The large number of students migrating to universities under the GI Bill, and the resultant increase in Penn's student population, highlighted that Penn had outgrown previous expansions, which ended during the Depression era.<ref>https://www.archives.upenn.edu/histy/genlhistory/pa_album/ch10.pdf</ref> This capital spending trend continued into the 1960s. As Penn Trustee Paul Miller stated in 1989, "...The bricks-and-mortar Capital Campaign of the Sixties...built the facilities that turned Penn from a commuter school to a residential one..."<ref>https://www.archives.upenn.edu/primdocs/uplan/billiondollarannouncement1989.pdf</ref>

===Educational innovations===
[[File:Universityofpennsylvaniacollegehall.jpg|thumb|College Hall and then Logan Hall viewed from Woodland Ave, c. 1892]]
Penn's educational innovations include: the nation's first medical school in 1765; the first university teaching hospital in 1874; the [[Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania|Wharton School]], the world's first collegiate business school, in 1881; the first American student union building, [[Houston Hall (University of Pennsylvania)|Houston Hall]], in 1896;<ref>{{cite book|title=Building America's First University: An Historical and Architectural Guide to the University of Pennsylvania|last1=Thomas|first1=George E.|last2=Brownlee|first2=David Bruce|year=2000|publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press|location=Philadelphia|page=3 |isbn=0-8122-3515-0}}</ref> the country's second school of veterinary medicine; and the home of [[ENIAC]], the world's first electronic, large-scale, general-purpose digital computer in 1946.

===Motto===
Penn's motto is based on a line from [[Horace]]'s III.24 (Book 3, Ode 24), ''quid leges sine moribus vanae proficiunt?'' ("of what avail empty laws without [good] morals?"). From 1756 to 1898, the motto read ''Sine Moribus Vanae''. When it was pointed out that the motto could be translated as "Loose women without morals", the university quickly changed the motto to ''literae sine moribus vanae'' ("Letters without morals [are] useless"). In 1932, all elements of the seal were revised. As part of the redesign, it was decided that the new motto "mutilated" Horace, and it was changed to its present wording, ''Leges Sine Moribus Vanae'' ("Laws without morals [are] useless").<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Hughes|first=Samuel|year=2002|url=http://www.upenn.edu/gazette/0102/0102finals.html|title=Whiskey, Loose Women, and Fig Leaves: The University's seal has a curious history|journal=Pennsylvania Gazette|volume=100|issue=3}}</ref>

===Seal===
[[File:1757 UPenn Seal.png|thumb|left|upright=0.7|1757 Seal of the Trustees of the University of Pennsylvania]]

The official [[Seal (emblem)|seal]] of the Trustees of the University of Pennsylvania serves as the signature and symbol of authenticity on documents issued by the corporation.<ref name="sealFAQ">{{cite web |url=https://secure.www.upenn.edu/secretary/FAQ.html|title=Frequently Asked Questions: Questions about the University |publisher=University of Pennsylvania|accessdate=October 4, 2011}}</ref> A request for one was first recorded in a meeting of the trustees in 1753 during which some of the Trustees "desired to get a Common Seal engraved for the Use of [the] Corporation". However, it was not until a meeting in 1756 that "a public Seal for the College with a proper device and Motto" was requested to be engraved in silver.<ref>{{cite book|last=Coleman|first=William|title=Trustees of the University of Pennsylvania Minute Books, volume 1|year=1749–1768|publisher=University of Pennsylvania|location=University of Pennsylvania Archives|pages=36, 68 |url=http://sceti.library.upenn.edu/pages/index.cfm?so_id=11133}}</ref> The most recent design, a modified version of the original seal, was approved in 1932, adopted a year later and is still used for much of the same purposes as the original.<ref name="sealFAQ"/>

The outer ring of the current seal is inscribed with "Universitas Pennsylvaniensis", the Latin name of the University of Pennsylvania. The inside contains seven stacked books on a desk with the titles of subjects of the [[trivium]] and a modified [[quadrivium]], components of a classical education: Theolog[ia], Astronom[ia], Philosoph[ia], Mathemat[ica], Logica, Rhetorica and Grammatica. Between the books and the outer ring is the Latin motto of the University, "Leges Sine Moribus Vanae".<ref name="sealFAQ"/>

==Campus==
[[File:Foliage at Penn 2005 035.jpg|thumb|right|Overlooking Lower Quad from Upper Quad]]
Much of Penn's architecture was designed by the [[Cope and Stewardson]] firm, whose principal architects combined the [[Gothic architecture]] of the [[University of Oxford]] and the [[University of Cambridge]] with the local landscape to establish the [[Gothic Revival architecture|Collegiate Gothic]] style. The present core campus covers over {{convert|279|acre|ha}} in a contiguous area of West Philadelphia's University City section, whereas the older heart of the campus comprises the [[University of Pennsylvania Campus Historic District]]. All of Penn's schools and most of its research institutes are located on this campus. The surrounding neighborhood includes several restaurants and pubs, a large upscale grocery store and a movie theater on the western edge of campus.

The campus has several notable art installations. The "Covenant", better known to the student body as "The Tampons",<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thedp.com/blog/under-the-button/2015/01/the-tampons-look-like-tampons-a-public-reminder|title=The Tampons Look Like Tampons: A Public Reminder|website=www.thedp.com|access-date=May 16, 2016}}</ref> is a large red structure located on Locust Walk between the high rise residences. It was installed in 1975 and is made of rolled sheets of milled steel. A larger-than-life white button, known as "[[The Button (sculpture)|The Button]]", is another popular sculpture. It sits at the south entrance of Van Pelt Library and has button holes large enough to stand in. Penn also has a replica of the "[[Love (sculpture)|Love]]" sculpture, part of a series created by [[Robert Indiana]]. It is a painted aluminum sculpture and was installed in 1998.

The Module 6 Utility Plant and Garage at Penn was designed by BLT Architects and completed in 1995. Module 6 is located at 38th and Walnut and includes spaces for 627 vehicles, {{convert|9000|sqft|m2|abbr=on}} of storefront retail operations, a 9,500-ton chiller module and corresponding extension of the campus chilled water loop and a 4,000-ton ice storage facility.<ref>{{cite web|title=University of Pennsylvania Module 6 Utility Plant and Garage|url=http://www.blta.com/#/3/0/4/7/|publisher=BLT Architects|accessdate=August 19, 2011}}</ref>

In 2007, Penn acquired about {{convert|35|acre|ha}} between the campus and the [[Schuylkill River]] (the former site of the [[Philadelphia Civic Center]] and a nearby {{convert|24|acre|ha|adj=on}} site owned by the United States Postal Service). Dubbed the Postal Lands, the site extends from Market Street on the north to Penn's Bower Field on the south, including the former main regional U.S. Postal Building at 30th and Market Streets, now the regional office for the U.S. Internal Revenue Service. Over the next decade, the site became the home to educational, research, [[biomedical engineering|biomedical]], and [[Mixed-use development|mixed-use]] facilities. The first phase, comprising a park and athletic facilities, opened in the fall of 2011. {{Update inline span|text=Penn also plans new connections between the campus and the city, including a pedestrian bridge.|reason=Have these been built yet?|?=yes|date=November 2018}} In 2010, in its first significant expansion across the [[Schuylkill River]], Penn purchased 23 acres at the northwest corner of 34th Street and Grays Ferry Avenue from [[DuPont]] for storage and office space.

[[File:Upper Quad Gate in the fall.jpg|thumb|left|Upper Quad Gate]]
In September 2011, Penn completed the construction of the $46.5 million {{convert|24|acre|m2|adj=on}} Penn Park, which features passive and active recreation and athletic components framed and subdivided by canopy trees, lawns, and meadows. It is located east of the Highline Green and stretches from Walnut Street to South Streets. The University also owns the {{convert|92|acre|ha|adj=on}} [[Morris Arboretum]] in [[Chestnut Hill, Philadelphia|Chestnut Hill]] in northwestern Philadelphia, the official arboretum of the state of [[Pennsylvania]]. Penn also owns the {{convert|687|acre|ha|adj=on}} [[New Bolton Center]], the research and large-animal health care center of its Veterinary School. Located near [[Kennett Square, Pennsylvania|Kennett Square]], New Bolton Center received nationwide media attention when [[Kentucky Derby]] winner [[Barbaro (horse)|Barbaro]] underwent surgery at its Widener Hospital for injuries suffered while running in the [[Preakness Stakes]].

Penn borders [[Drexel University]] and is near the [[University of the Sciences in Philadelphia]]. The renowned cancer research center [[Wistar Institute]] is also located on campus. In 2014, a new 7-story glass and steel building was completed next to the Institute's historic 117-year-old brick building further expanding collaboration between the university and the Wistar Institute.<ref>{{cite news|last=Clarke|first=Dominique |title=Wistar strategic plan includes new building and research|url=http://thedp.com/index.php/article/2011/09/wistar_strategic_plan_includes_new_building_and_research|accessdate=November 10, 2011|newspaper=The Daily Pennsylvanian|date=September 26, 2011}}</ref>

===Libraries===<!-- This section is linked from [[NeXT]] -->
[[File:FisherFineArtsLibrary.JPG|thumb|right|[[Fisher Fine Arts Library]], also referred to as the Furness Library or simply the Fine Arts Library]]
Penn's library began in 1750 with a donation of books from cartographer [[Lewis Evans (surveyor)|Lewis Evans]]. Twelve years later, then-provost [[William Smith (Anglican priest)|William Smith]] sailed to England to raise additional funds to increase the collection size. [[Benjamin Franklin]] was one of the Libraries' earliest donors and, as a Trustee, saw to it that funds were allocated for the purchase of texts from London, many of which are still part of the collection, more than 250 years later. It has grown into a system of 15 libraries (13 are on the contiguous campus) with 400 [[full-time equivalent]] (FTE) employees and a total operating budget of more than $48&nbsp;million. The library system has 6.19 million book and serial volumes as well as 4.23 million [[microform]] items and 1.11 million e-books.<ref name="Penn: Penn Facts"/> It subscribes to over 68,000 print serials and e-journals.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://datafarm.library.upenn.edu/|title=Penn Library Data Farm|accessdate=December 24, 2009}}</ref>

===Residences===
{{Main|University of Pennsylvania College Houses}}
Every College House at the University of Pennsylvania has at least four members of faculty in the roles of House Dean, Faculty Master and College House Fellows.<ref name="College House PDF">{{cite web|title=College Houses at Penn|url=http://www.collegehouses.upenn.edu/brochure/collegehouses_11-12.pdf|work=College Houses and Academic Services|publisher=University of Pennsylvania|format=PDF|accessdate=August 19, 2011|archivedate=October 1, 2011|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111001225828/http://www.collegehouses.upenn.edu/brochure/collegehouses_11-12.pdf|deadurl=yes}}</ref> Within the College Houses, Penn has nearly 40 themed residential programs for students with shared interests such as world cinema or science and technology. Many of the nearby homes and apartments in the area surrounding the campus are often rented by undergraduate students moving off campus after their first year, as well as by graduate and professional students.

The College Houses include W.E.B. Du Bois, Fisher Hassenfeld, Gregory, Harnwell, Harrison, Hill, Kings Court English, New College House, Riepe, Rodin, Stouffer and Ware.<ref>{{cite web|title=College Houses & Academic Services: University of Pennsylvania|url=http://www.collegehouses.upenn.edu/brochure/index.asp|website=Collegehouses.upenn.edu|accessdate=July 23, 2013|archivedate=August 12, 2013|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130812121818/http://www.collegehouses.upenn.edu/brochure/index.asp|deadurl=yes}}</ref> Fisher Hassenfeld, Ware and Riepe together make up one building called "The Quad".

==Academics==
{{Graduate schools of the University of Pennsylvania}}
<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:PENN 043.jpg|thumb|Lower Quad from Riepe College House]] -->
The [[University of Pennsylvania School of Arts and Sciences|College of Arts and Sciences]] is the undergraduate division of the School of Arts and Sciences. The School of Arts and Sciences also contains the Graduate Division and the College of Liberal and Professional Studies, which is home to the [[Fels Institute of Government]], the master's programs in Organizational Dynamics, and the Environmental Studies (MES) program. [[Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania|Wharton]] is the business school of the University of Pennsylvania. Other schools with undergraduate programs include the [[University of Pennsylvania School of Nursing|School of Nursing]] and the [[University of Pennsylvania School of Engineering and Applied Science|School of Engineering and Applied Science (SEAS)]].

Penn has a strong focus on interdisciplinary learning and research. It offers double degree programs, unique majors, and academic flexibility. Penn's "One University" policy allows undergraduates access to courses at all of Penn's undergraduate and graduate schools except the medical, veterinary and dental schools. Undergraduates at Penn may also take courses at [[Bryn Mawr College|Bryn Mawr]], [[Haverford College|Haverford]], and [[Swarthmore College|Swarthmore]] under a reciprocal agreement known as the [[Quaker Consortium]].

===Coordinated dual-degree and interdisciplinary programs===
Penn offers specialized [[double degree|coordinated dual-degree]] (CDD) programs, which award candidates degrees from multiple schools at the university upon completion of graduation criteria of both schools. Undergraduate programs include:
*[[The Jerome Fisher Program in Management and Technology]]
*Artificial Intelligence: Computer and Cognitive Science
*[[The Huntsman Program in International Studies and Business]]
*Nursing and Health Care Management
*[[Vagelos Program in Life Sciences and Management|The Roy and Diana Vagelos Program in Life Sciences and Management]]
*[[Vagelos Scholars Program in Molecular Life Sciences]]
*Vagelos Integrated Program in Energy Research (VIPER)
*Accelerated 7 year Bio-Dental Program
*[[Singh Program in Networked & Social Systems Engineering (NETS)]]<ref>{{cite web|title=NETS Homepage|url=http://www.nets.upenn.edu/|publisher=Penn Engineering|accessdate=November 16, 2014}}</ref>
*Accelerated 6-year Law and Medicine Program<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.philly.com/philly/education/20160623_Penn_to_launch_joint_degree_program_in_law_and_medicine.html|title=Penn to launch joint degree program in law and medicine|website=Philly.com|access-date=June 22, 2016}}</ref>

Dual-degree programs which lead to the same multiple degrees without participation in the specific above programs are also available. Unlike CDD programs, "dual degree" students fulfill requirements of both programs independently without involvement of another program. Specialized dual-degree programs include Liberal Studies and Technology as well as an Artificial Intelligence: Computer and Cognitive Science Program. Both programs award a degree from the College of Arts and Sciences and a degree from the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences. In addition, the [[Vagelos Scholars Program in Molecular Life Sciences]] allows its students to either double major in the sciences or submatriculate and earn both a B.A. and a M.S. in four years. The most recent Vagelos Integrated Program in Energy Research (VIPER) will be first offered for the class of 2016. A joint program of Penn's School of Arts and Sciences and the School of Engineering and Applied Science, VIPER leads to dual Bachelor of Arts and Bachelor of Science in Engineering degrees by combining majors from each school.

For graduate programs, Penn offers many formalized [[double degree]] graduate degrees such as a joint J.D./MBA, and maintains a list of interdisciplinary institutions, such as the Institute for Medicine and Engineering, the Joseph H. Lauder Institute for Management and International Studies, and the Institute for Research in Cognitive Science.

Penn's health-related programs—including the Schools of Medicine, Dental Medicine, Nursing, and Veterinary Medicine, and programs in bioengineering (School of Engineering), biology (School of Arts and Sciences), and health management (the Wharton School)—are among the university's strongest academic components.

However, the size of Penn's biomedical research organization adds a very capital intensive component to the university's operations and introduces revenue instability due to changing government regulations, reduced federal funding for research, and [[Medicare and Medicaid]] program changes. This is a primary reason highlighted in bond rating agencies' views on Penn's overall financial rating, which ranks one notch below its academic peers. Penn has worked to address these issues by pooling its schools (as well as several hospitals and clinical practices) into the [[University of Pennsylvania Health System]], thereby pooling resources for greater efficiencies and research impact.

===Admissions selectivity===
The ''[[Princeton Review]]'' ranks Penn as the 6th most selective school in the United States.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia|url=http://www.mycollegeplanning.com/images/pdfs/The%20Ten%20Toughest%20Schools%20to%20Get%20Into%5B1%5D.pdf|title=The Ten Toughest Schools to Get Into|publisher=My College Planning LLC|format=PDF|accessdate=July 31, 2011|archivedate=April 26, 2012|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120426041205/http://www.mycollegeplanning.com/images/pdfs/The%20Ten%20Toughest%20Schools%20to%20Get%20Into%5B1%5D.pdf|deadurl=yes}}</ref> For the Class of 2022, entering in the fall of 2018, the University received a record-high 44,482 applications and admitted 8.39 percent of the applicants (6.46% in the regular decision cycle), marking Penn's most selective admissions cycle in the history of the University.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thedp.com/article/2018/03/class-of-2022-admissions-regular-decisions-university-of-pennsylvania-upenn-penn-philadelphia-acceptance-rate|title=Penn admits a record-low 8.39 percent of applicants to the Class of 2022|work=[[The Daily Pennsylvanian]]|author= Yoni Gutenmacher |date=March 28, 2018|accessdate=March 29, 2018}}</ref> ''[[The Atlantic]]'' also ranked Penn among the 10 most selective schools in the country. At the graduate level, based on admission statistics from ''U.S. News & World Report'', Penn's most selective programs include its law school, the health care schools (medicine, dental medicine, nursing, Social Work and veterinary) and its business school.

Penn's research tradition has historically been complemented by innovations that shaped higher education. In addition to establishing the first medical school, the first university teaching hospital, the first business school and the first student union, Penn was also the cradle of other significant developments. In 1852, Penn Law was the first law school in the nation to publish a law journal still in existence (then called ''The American Law Register,'' now the ''[[University of Pennsylvania Law Review|Penn Law Review]]'', one of the most cited law journals in the world).<ref>{{cite web|title=Law Journals: Submissions and Ranking|url=http://lawlib.wlu.edu/LJ/index.aspx|publisher=Washington and Lee University School of Law|accessdate=November 10, 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111121012415/http://lawlib.wlu.edu/lj/index.aspx|archivedate=November 21, 2011}}</ref> Under the deanship of [[William Draper Lewis]], the law school was also one of the first schools to emphasize legal teaching by full-time professors instead of practitioners, a system that is still followed today.<ref>Owen Roberts, William Draper Lewis, 89 U. Pa. L. Rev. 1 (1949)</ref> The Wharton School was home to several pioneering developments in business education.

Several major scientific discoveries have also taken place at Penn. The university is probably best known as the place where the first general-purpose electronic computer ([[ENIAC]]) was born in 1946 at the [[Moore School of Electrical Engineering]].<ref name="Moore Engineering">{{cite web|url=http://www.archives.upenn.edu/histy/features/computers/intro.html|title=Important Milestones and Fascinating Innovations During the Last Fifty Years of Computing Research at the University of Pennsylvania}}</ref> It was here also where the world's first spelling and grammar checkers were created, as well as the popular [[COBOL]] programming language.<ref name="Moore Engineering"/> Penn can also boast some of the most important discoveries in the field of medicine. The [[dialysis]] machine used as an artificial replacement for lost kidney function was conceived and devised out of a pressure cooker by William Inouye while he was still a student at Penn Med;<ref name="Medical Innovations">{{cite web|url=http://www.med.upenn.edu/research/visitors/highlights.shtml|title=Some Research Highlights at PENN Medicine|access-date=August 28, 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110620150709/http://www.med.upenn.edu/research/visitors/highlights.shtml|archive-date=June 20, 2011|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}</ref> the [[Rubella]] and [[Hepatitis B]] vaccines were developed at Penn;<ref name="Medical Innovations"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nndb.com/people/390/000130997/|title=Baruch S.

Heeger]], [[Alan MacDiarmid]] and [[Hideki Shirakawa]], an invention that earned them the [[Nobel Prize in Chemistry]]. On faculty since 1965, [[Ralph L. Brinster]] developed the scientific basis for [[in vitro fertilization]] and the transgenic mouse at Penn. The theory of [[BCS theory|superconductivity]] was also partly developed at Penn, by then faculty member [[John Robert Schrieffer]] (along with [[John Bardeen]] and [[Leon Cooper]]). The university has also contributed major advancements in the fields of economics and management. Among the many discoveries are [[conjoint analysis]], widely used as a predictive tool especially in market research, [[Simon Kuznets]]'s method of measuring [[Gross National Product]],<ref name="125 Influential People and Ideas">{{cite web|url=http://www.wharton.upenn.edu/infodocs/alum_mag/am07anniv.pdf|title=125 Influential People and Ideas|access-date=August 28, 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110610064028/http://www.wharton.upenn.edu/infodocs/alum_mag/am07anniv.pdf|archive-date=June 10, 2011|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}</ref> the [[Penn effect]] (the observation that consumer price levels in richer countries are systematically higher than in poorer ones) and the "Wharton Model"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/727461/Wharton-Model|title=Wharton Model (economics) – Britannica Online Encyclopedia|publisher=Britannica.com|accessdate=March 18, 2012}}</ref> developed by Nobel-laureate [[Lawrence Klein]] to measure and forecast economic activity.

==Athletics==
{{Main|Penn Quakers}}
Penn's [[college athletics|sports]] teams are nicknamed the [[Religious Society of Friends|Quakers]], but the teams are often also referred to as [[The Red and the Blue|The Red & Blue]]. The athletes participate in the [[Ivy League]] and [[Division I (NCAA)|Division&nbsp;I]] (Division&nbsp;I FCS for football) in the [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]]. In recent decades, they often have been [[sports league|league]] champions in football (14 times from 1982 to 2010) and basketball (22 times from 1970 to 2006). The first athletic team at Penn was its [[cricket]] team.<ref>{{cite news|last=Kieran|first=John|title=Sports of the Times|newspaper=New York Times|date=October 8, 1932|page=22}}</ref>
[[File:U. of Pa. varsity, 1915 (LOC).jpg|thumb|right|Varsity rowers approach [[Poughkeepsie Bridge]] on the Hudson River, 1915]]

===Rowing===
[[Rowing (sport)|Rowing]] at Penn dates back to at least 1854 with the founding of the [[University Barge Club]]. The university currently hosts both heavyweight and lightweight men's teams and an openweight women's team, all of which compete as part of the [[Eastern Sprints]] League. Penn Rowing has produced a long list of famous coaches and Olympians, including [[Susan Francia]], [[John B. Kelly Jr.]], [[Joe Burk]], Rusty Callow, [[Harry Parker (rower)|Harry Parker]] and [[Ted Nash (rower)|Ted Nash]]. In addition, the 1955 men's heavyweight crew is one of only four American university crews to win the [[Grand Challenge Cup]] at the [[Henley Royal Regatta]]. The teams row out of [[College Boat Club]], No.11 [[Boathouse Row]].

===Rugby===
The Penn Men's [[Rugby football|Rugby]] Football Club is recognized as one of the oldest collegiate rugby teams in America. The earliest documentation of its existence comes from a 1910 issue of the ''Daily Pennsylvanian.'' The team existed on and off during the [[World War]]s.

The current club has its roots in the 1960s and from the influence of star winger Andrew Margolis. The University of Pennsylvania rugby teams play in the [[Ivy Rugby Conference]] and have finished as runners-up in both 15s and 7s.<ref>Rugby Mag, College 7s Looks to CRC, December 12, 2012, http://www.rugbymag.com/tournaments-special/crc/6668-college-7s-looks-to-crc.html {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130116181127/http://www.rugbymag.com/tournaments-special/crc/6668-college-7s-looks-to-crc.html |date=January 16, 2013 }}</ref> {{as of|2011}}, the club now utilize the state-of-the-art facilities at [[Penn Park]]. Quakers Rugby played on national TV at the 2013 [[Collegiate Rugby Championship]], a college rugby tournament played every June at [[PPL Park]] in Philadelphia and broadcast live on NBC. In their inaugural year of participation, the Penn men's rugby team won the Shield Competition, beating local rivals Temple University 17–12 in the final. In doing so, they became the first Philadelphia team to beat a non-Philadelphia team in CRC history, with a 14–12 win over the University of Texas in the Shield semi-final.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.usasevenscrc.com/fixtures-and-results/|title=Fixtures and Results|work=usasevenscrc.com}}</ref>

===Cricket===
In the latter half of the nineteenth century and in the early twentieth Philadelphia was the center of [[cricket in the United States]]. Cricket had gained in popularity among the upper class from their travels abroad and cricket clubs sprung up all across the Eastern Seaboard (even today Philadelphia still has three cricket clubs—the [[Philadelphia Cricket Club|Philadelphia]], the [[Merion Cricket Club|Merion]] and the [[Germantown Cricket Club|Germantown]]). Many East Coast universities and colleges fielded cricket teams with the University of Pennsylvania and [[Haverford College]] being two of the best in the country.  (Cricket was the first organized sport at Pennsylvania.)  The Penn Cricket Team frequently toured Canada and the British Isles, and even defeated a combined Oxford-Cambridge team in 1895.<ref name="Penn Cricket">{{cite web | url=http://www.archives.upenn.edu/histy/features/sports/cricket/histy.html | title=Penn Cricket in the 1800s: Penn's first organized sport: Historical overview | publisher=University of Pennsylvania | work=University Archives and Records Center | date=February 2006 | accessdate=July 4, 2018 | author=Seth S. Tannenbaum and Clifton R. Hood}}</ref> Perhaps the University's most famous cricket player was [[George Patterson (cricketer)|George Patterson]] who went on to play for the professional [[Philadelphia Cricket Team]]. Following the First World War, cricket began to experience a serious decline as baseball became the preferred sport of the warmer months, but to this day the University still fields a cricket team.

===Football===
{{Main|Penn Quakers football}}
[[File:FranklinFieldPenn.jpg|thumb|right|[[Franklin Field]], home to football, field hockey, lacrosse and track and field]]
Penn first fielded a [[American football|football]] team against [[Princeton University|Princeton]] at the [[Germantown Cricket Club]] in Philadelphia on November 11, 1876.<ref name="Fight song">[[Rottenberg, Dan]] (1985) "Fight On, Pennsylvania" Trustees of University of Pennsylvania pg. 25, 28, 33, 34.</ref>

Penn football made many contributions to the sport in its early days. During the 1890s, Penn's famed coach and alumnus [[George Washington Woodruff]] introduced the quarterback kick, a forerunner of the [[forward pass]], as well as the [[Placekicker|place-kick]] from scrimmage and the delayed pass. In 1894, 1895, 1897 and 1904, Penn was generally regarded as the national champion of collegiate football.<ref name="Fight song" /> The achievements of two of Penn's outstanding players from that era—[[John Heisman]] and [[John Outland]]—are remembered each year with the presentation of the [[Heisman Trophy]] to the most outstanding college football player of the year, and the [[Outland Trophy]] to the most outstanding college football [[Lineman (gridiron football)|interior lineman]] of the year.

In addition, each year the [[Bednarik Award]] is given to college football's best defensive player. [[Chuck Bednarik]] (Class of 1949) was a three-time [[All-America]]n [[Center (American football)|center]]/[[linebacker]] who starred on the 1947 team and is generally regarded as Penn's all-time finest. In addition to Bednarik, the 1947 squad boasted four-time All-American [[Offensive tackle|tackle]] [[George Savitsky]] and three-time All-American [[Halfback (American football)|halfback]] [[Skip Minisi]]. All three standouts were subsequently elected to the [[College Football Hall of Fame]], as was their coach, [[George Munger (American football)|George Munger]] (a star running back at Penn in the early 1930s). Bednarik went on to play for 12 years with the [[Philadelphia Eagles]], becoming the [[National Football League|NFL's]] last 60-minute man. He was elected to the [[Pro Football Hall of Fame]] in 1969. During his presidency of the institution from 1948 to 1953, [[Harold Stassen]] attempted to recultivate Penn's heyday of big-time [[college football]], but the effort lacked support and was short-lived.

[[ESPN]]'s ''[[College GameDay (football)|College GameDay]]'' traveled to Penn to highlight the [[Harvard University|Harvard]]-Penn game on November 17, 2002, the first time the popular college football show had visited an Ivy League campus.

===Basketball===
[[File:The Palestra.JPG|thumb|right|The [[Palestra]], "Cathedral of Basketball"]]
{{Main|Penn Quakers men's basketball}}
Penn [[basketball]] is steeped in tradition. Penn made its only (and the Ivy League's second) [[Final Four]] appearance in 1979, where the Quakers lost to [[Magic Johnson]]-led [[Michigan State Spartans|Michigan State]] in Salt Lake City. (Dartmouth twice finished second in the tournament in the 1940s, but that was before the beginning of formal League play.) Penn's team is also a member of the [[Philadelphia Big 5]], along with [[La Salle University|La Salle]], [[Saint Joseph's University|Saint Joseph's]], [[Temple University|Temple]] and [[Villanova University|Villanova]]. In 2007, the men's team won its third consecutive Ivy League title and then lost in the first round of the [[NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship|NCAA Tournament]] to [[Texas A&M Aggies|Texas A&M]].

===Facilities===
[[Franklin Field]] is where the Quakers play football, [[field hockey]], [[lacrosse]], [[sprint football]] and track and field (and formerly soccer). It is the oldest stadium still operating for football games and was the first stadium to sport two tiers. It hosted the first commercially televised football game, was once the home field of the Philadelphia Eagles, and was the site of 18 [[Army–Navy Game|Army–Navy]] games between 1899 and 1935.<ref>Didinger, Ray; Lyons, Robert S. (2005). ''The Eagles Encyclopedia''. Philadelphia: Temple University Press. p.&nbsp;205. {{ISBN|1-59213-449-1}}. Retrieved 2009-01-08</ref>

Today it is also used by Penn students for recreation such as [[intramural sports|intramural]] and club sports, including [[Touch football (American)|touch football]] and cricket. Franklin Field hosts the annual collegiate track and field event "the [[Penn Relays]]."

Penn's home court, the [[Palestra]], is an arena used for men's and women's basketball teams, volleyball teams, [[wrestling]] team and [[Philadelphia Big 5|Philadelphia Big Five basketball]], as well as high school sporting events. The Palestra has hosted more NCAA Tournament basketball games than any other facility. Penn baseball plays its home games at [[Meiklejohn Stadium]].

The [[1980 Olympic boycott|Olympic Boycott Games]] of 1980 were held at the University of Pennsylvania in response to Moscow's hosting of the [[1980 Summer Olympics]] following the [[Soviet–Afghan War|Soviet incursion in Afghanistan]]. Twenty-nine of the boycotting nations participated in the Boycott Games.
