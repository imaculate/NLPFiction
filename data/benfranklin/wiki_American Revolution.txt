The '''American Revolution''' was a colonial revolt that took place between 1765 and 1783. The American Patriots in the [[Thirteen Colonies]] won independence from Great Britain, becoming the [[United States|United States of America]]. They defeated the British in the [[American Revolutionary War]] (1775–1783) in alliance with France and others.

Members of [[Colonial history of the United States|American colonial society]] argued the position of "[[no taxation without representation]]", starting with the [[Stamp Act Congress]] in 1765. They rejected the authority of [[Parliament of Great Britain|the British Parliament]] to tax them because they lacked members in that governing body. Protests steadily escalated to the [[Boston Massacre]] in 1770 and the [[Gaspee Affair|burning of the ''Gaspee'']] in [[Colony of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations|Rhode Island]] in 1772, followed by the [[Boston Tea Party]] in December 1773, during which Patriots destroyed a consignment of taxed tea. The British responded by closing Boston Harbor, then followed with a [[Intolerable Acts|series of legislative acts]] which effectively rescinded [[Massachusetts Bay Colony]]'s rights of self-government and caused the other colonies to rally behind Massachusetts. In late 1774, the Patriots set up [[First Continental Congress|their own alternative government]] to better coordinate their resistance efforts against Great Britain; other colonists preferred to remain aligned to the Crown and were known as [[Loyalist (American Revolution)|''Loyalists'']] or ''Tories''.

Tensions erupted into battle between Patriot militia and British regulars when the king's army attempted to capture and destroy Colonial military supplies at [[Battles of Lexington and Concord|Lexington and Concord]] on April 19, 1775. The conflict then developed into a global war, during which the Patriots (and later their French, Spanish, and Dutch allies) fought the British and Loyalists in what became known as the [[American Revolutionary War]] (1775–83). Each of the thirteen colonies formed a [[Provincial Congress]] that assumed power from the old colonial governments and suppressed Loyalism, and from there they built a [[Continental Army]] under the leadership of General [[George Washington]]. The Continental Congress determined [[George III of the United Kingdom|King George]]'s rule to be tyrannical and infringing the colonists' [[Rights of Englishmen|rights as Englishmen]], and they declared the colonies [[Lee Resolution|free and independent states]] on July 2, 1776. The Patriot leadership professed the political philosophies of [[Liberalism in the United States|liberalism]] and [[Republicanism in the United States|republicanism]] to reject monarchy and aristocracy, and they proclaimed that all men are created equal.

The Continental Army [[Siege of Boston|forced the redcoats out of Boston]] in March 1776, but that summer [[New York and New Jersey campaign|the British captured and held New York City]] and its strategic harbor for the duration of the war. The Royal Navy blockaded ports and captured other cities for brief periods, but they failed to defeat Washington's forces. The Patriots unsuccessfully [[Invasion of Quebec (1775)|attempted to invade Canada during the winter of 1775–76]], but successfully captured a British army at the [[Battle of Saratoga]] in October 1777. France now entered the war as an ally of the United States with a large army and navy that threatened Britain itself. The war turned to the American South where the British under the leadership of [[Charles Cornwallis, 1st Marquess Cornwallis|Charles Cornwallis]] captured an army at [[Charleston, South Carolina]] in early 1780 but failed to enlist enough volunteers from Loyalist civilians to take effective control of the territory. A combined American–French force captured a second British army [[Siege of Yorktown|at Yorktown]] in the fall of 1781, effectively ending the war. The [[Treaty of Paris (1783)|Treaty of Paris]] was signed September 3, 1783, formally ending the conflict and confirming the new nation's complete separation from the British Empire. The United States took possession of nearly all the territory east of the Mississippi River and south of the Great Lakes, with the British retaining control of Canada and Spain taking Florida.

Among the significant results of the revolution was the creation of the [[United States Constitution]], establishing a relatively strong federal national government that included an [[President of the United States|executive]], a [[United States Supreme Court|national judiciary]], and a bicameral [[Congress of the United States|Congress]] that represented states in the [[United States Senate|Senate]] and the population in the [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]].<ref name="Wood, 1992">Wood, ''The Radicalism of the American Revolution'' (1992)</ref><ref>Greene and Pole (1994) chapter 70</ref> The Revolution also resulted in the migration of around 60,000 Loyalists to other British territories, especially British North America (Canada).

[[File:1768 Boundary Line Map Treaty of Ft Stanwix.jpg|Thumb|300px|left|Boundary Line Map of 1768 move the boundary West]] Historians typically begin their histories of the American Revolution with the British coalition victory in the [[Seven Years' War]] in 1763. The North American theater of the Seven Years' War is commonly known as the [[French and Indian War]] in the United States; it removed France as a major player in North American affairs and led to the territory of [[New France]] being ceded to Great Britain. [[Lawrence Henry Gipson]] writes: {{quote|It may be said as truly that the American Revolution was an aftermath of the Anglo-French conflict in the New World carried on between 1754 and 1763.}}<ref>Lawrence Henry Gipson, "The American revolution as an aftermath of the Great War for the Empire, 1754–1763." ''Political Science Quarterly'' (1950): 86–104.[https://www.jstor.org/stable/2144276 in JSTOR]</ref>

The [[Royal Proclamation of 1763]] may also have{{weasel inline|date=September 2018}} played a role in the separation of the [[Thirteen Colonies]] from England, as colonists wanted to continue migrating west to lands awarded by the Crown for their wartime service.{{citation needed|date=September 2018}} The Proclamation, however, cut them off. The lands west of Quebec and west of a line running along the crest of the [[Allegheny Mountains]] became Indian territory, barred to settlement for two years.

The colonists protested, and the boundary line was adjusted in a series of treaties with the Indians. In 1768, Indians agreed to the [[Treaty of Fort Stanwix]] and the [[Treaty of Hard Labour]], followed in 1770 by the [[Treaty of Lochaber]]. The treaties opened most of Kentucky and West Virginia to colonial settlement. The new map was drawn up at the Treaty of Fort Stanwix in 1768 which moved the line much farther to the west, from the green line to the red line on the map at right.<ref>{{cite book|author=William J Campbell|title=Speculators in Empire: Iroquoia and the 1768 Treaty of Fort Stanwix|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=J5_ACAAAQBAJ&pg=PT118|date=29 April 2015|publisher=University of Oklahoma Press|pages=118–20|isbn=978-0806147109}}</ref>

In 1764, Parliament passed the [[Currency Act]] to restrain the use of paper money, fearing that otherwise the colonists might evade debt payments.<ref>{{cite book|last=Allen|first=Larry|title=The Encyclopedia of Money|location=Santa Barbara, Calif.|publisher=ABC-CLIO|date=2009|isbn=978-1598842517|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=X4kgDkYxGrcC&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage|pages=96–97}}</ref> Parliament also passed the [[Sugar Act]], imposing customs [[Duty (economics)|duties]] on a number of articles. That same year, Prime Minister [[George Grenville]] proposed direct taxes on the colonies to raise revenue, but he delayed action to see whether the colonies would propose some way to raise the revenue themselves.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}} Parliament finally passed the Stamp Act in March 1765 which imposed direct taxes on the colonies for the first time. All official documents, newspapers, almanacs, and pamphlets were required to have the stamps—even decks of playing cards.

The colonists did not object that the taxes were high; they were actually low.<ref>Englishmen paid an average 25 shillings annually in taxes, whereas Americans paid only sixpence. Miller, ''Origins of the American Revolution'' (1943) p. 89</ref> They objected to the fact that they had no representation in the Parliament, and thus no voice concerning legislation that affected them. [[Benjamin Franklin]] testified in Parliament in 1766 that Americans already contributed heavily to the defense of the Empire. He said that local governments had raised, outfitted, and paid 25,000 soldiers to fight France—as many as Britain itself sent—and spent many millions from American treasuries doing so in the [[French and Indian War]] alone.<ref>{{cite book|last=James A.

The decision was to keep them on active duty with full pay, but they had to be stationed somewhere. Stationing a [[standing army]] in Great Britain during peacetime was politically unacceptable, so the decision was made to station them in America and have the Americans pay them. The soldiers had no military mission; they were not there to defend the colonies because there was no threat to the colonies.<ref>Shy, ''Toward Lexington'' 73–78</ref>

The [[Sons of Liberty]] were formed in 1765. They used public demonstrations, [[boycott]], violence, and threats of violence to ensure that the British tax laws were unenforceable. In Boston, the Sons of Liberty burned the records of the [[vice admiralty court]] and looted the home of chief justice [[Thomas Hutchinson (governor)|Thomas Hutchinson]]. Several legislatures called for united action, and nine colonies sent delegates to the [[Stamp Act Congress]] in [[New York City]] in October 1765. Moderates led by [[John Dickinson (delegate)|John Dickinson]] drew up a "[[Declaration of Rights and Grievances]]" stating that taxes passed without representation violated their [[Rights of Englishmen|rights as Englishmen]]. Colonists emphasized their determination by boycotting imports of British merchandise.<ref>T.H. Breen, ''American Insurgents, American Patriots: The Revolution of the People'' (2010) pp. 81–82</ref>

The Parliament at Westminster saw itself as the supreme lawmaking authority throughout all British possessions and thus entitled to levy any tax without colonial approval.<ref>Middlekauff p. 62</ref> They argued that the colonies were legally British corporations that were completely subordinate to the British parliament and pointed to numerous instances where Parliament had made laws binding on the colonies in the past.<ref name="Lecky, William Edward Hartpole 1882 pp. 297–98">Lecky, William Edward Hartpole, [https://archive.org/stream/historyofengland03leck#page/297/mode/1up A History of England in the Eighteenth Century] (1882) pp. 297–98</ref> They did not see anything in the unwritten British constitution that made taxes special<ref>Lecky, William Edward Hartpole, [https://archive.org/stream/historyofengland03leck#page/315/mode/1up A History of England in the Eighteenth Century] (1882) pp. 315–16</ref> and noted that they had taxed American trade for decades. Parliament insisted that the colonies effectively enjoyed a "[[virtual representation]]" as most British people did, as only a small minority of the British population elected representatives to Parliament.<ref>Lecky, William Edward Hartpole, [https://archive.org/stream/historyofengland03leck#page/173/mode/1up A History of England in the Eighteenth Century] (1882) p. 173</ref> Americans such as [[James Otis, Jr.|James Otis]] maintained that the Americans were not in fact virtually represented.<ref>{{cite book|author=Bryan-Paul Frost and Jeffrey Sikkenga|title=History of American Political Thought|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=w81L1qAhNjoC&pg=PA55|year=2003|publisher=Lexington Books|pages=55–56|isbn=978-0739106242}}</ref>

In London, the [[Charles Watson-Wentworth, 2nd Marquess of Rockingham|Rockingham]] government came to power (July 1765) and Parliament debated whether to repeal the stamp tax or to send an army to enforce it. Benjamin Franklin made the case for repeal, explaining that the colonies had spent heavily in manpower, money, and blood in defense of the empire in a series of wars against the French and Indians, and that further taxes to pay for those wars were unjust and might bring about a rebellion. Parliament agreed and repealed the tax (February 21, 1766), but insisted in the [[Declaratory Act]] of March 1766 that they retained full power to make laws for the colonies "in all cases whatsoever".<ref>

===1767–1773: Townshend Acts and the Tea Act===

[[File:Gaspee Affair.jpg|thumb|alt=Burning of the Gaspee|<center>Burning of the ''[[Gaspee Affair|Gaspee]]''</center>]]

In 1767, the Parliament passed the [[Townshend Acts]] which placed duties on a number of essential goods, including paper, glass, and tea, and established a Board of Customs in Boston to more rigorously execute trade regulations. The new taxes were enacted on the belief that Americans only objected to internal taxes and not to external taxes such as custom duties. The Americans, however, argued against the constitutionality of the act because its purpose was to raise revenue and not regulate trade.<ref>Melvin I. Urofsky and Paul Finkelman, ''A March of Liberty: A Constitutional History of the United States'' (Oxford UP, 2002) v. 1 p. 52.</ref> Colonists responded by organizing new boycotts of British goods. These boycotts were less effective, however, as the Townshend goods were widely used.

In February 1768, the Assembly of Massachusetts Bay [[Massachusetts Circular Letter|issued a circular letter]] to the other colonies urging them to coordinate resistance. The governor dissolved the assembly when it refused to rescind the letter. Meanwhile, a riot broke out in Boston in June 1768 over the seizure of the sloop ''Liberty'', owned by [[John Hancock]], for alleged smuggling. Customs officials were forced to flee, prompting the British to deploy troops to Boston. A Boston town meeting declared that no obedience was due to parliamentary laws and called for the convening of a convention. A convention assembled but only issued a mild protest before dissolving itself. In January 1769, Parliament responded to the unrest by reactivating the [[Treason Act 1543]] which called for subjects outside the realm to face trials for treason in England. The governor of Massachusetts was instructed to collect evidence of said treason, and the threat caused widespread outrage, though it was not carried out.

On March 5, 1770, a large crowd gathered around a group of British soldiers. The crowd grew threatening, throwing snowballs, rocks, and debris at them. One soldier was clubbed and fell.<ref name="Hiller B. Zobel 1996">Hiller B. Zobel, ''The Boston Massacre'' (1996)</ref> There was no order to fire, but the soldiers fired into the crowd anyway. They hit 11 people; three civilians died at the scene of the shooting, and two died after the incident. The event quickly came to be called the [[Boston Massacre]]. The soldiers were tried and acquitted (defended by [[John Adams]]), but the widespread descriptions soon began to turn colonial sentiment against the British. This, in turn, began a downward spiral in the relationship between Britain and the Province of Massachusetts.<ref name="Hiller B. Zobel 1996"/>

A new ministry under [[Lord North]] came to power in 1770, and Parliament withdrew all taxes except the tax on tea, giving up its efforts to raise revenue while maintaining the right to tax. This temporarily resolved the crisis, and the boycott of British goods largely ceased, with only the more radical patriots such as [[Samuel Adams]] continuing to agitate.

In June 1772, American [[Patriot (American Revolution)|patriots]], including [[John Brown (Rhode Island)|John Brown]], burned a British warship that had been vigorously enforcing unpopular trade regulations in what became known as the [[Gaspee Affair|''Gaspee'' Affair]]. The affair was investigated for possible treason, but no action was taken.

In 1772, it became known that the Crown intended to pay fixed salaries to the governors and judges in Massachusetts. Samuel Adams in Boston set about creating new Committees of Correspondence, which linked Patriots in all 13 colonies and eventually provided the framework for a rebel government. Virginia, the largest colony, set up its Committee of Correspondence in early 1773, on which Patrick Henry and Thomas Jefferson served.<ref>Greene and Pole (1994) chapters 22–24</ref>

A total of about 7000 to 8000 Patriots served on "Committees of Correspondence" at the colonial and local levels, comprising most of the leadership in their communities. Loyalists were excluded. The committees became the [[leadership|leaders]] of the American resistance to British actions, and largely determined the war effort at the state and local level. When the First Continental Congress decided to boycott British products, the colonial and local Committees took charge, examining merchant records and publishing the names of merchants who attempted to defy the boycott by importing British goods.<ref name="Mary Beth Norton 2001 pp 144">Mary Beth Norton et al., ''A People and a Nation'' (6th ed. 2001) vol 1 pp. 144–45

In 1773, [[Hutchinson Letters Affair|private letters were published]] in which Massachusetts Governor Thomas Hutchinson claimed that the colonists could not enjoy all English liberties, and Lieutenant Governor [[Andrew Oliver]] called for the direct payment of colonial officials. The letters' contents were used as evidence of a systematic plot against American rights, and discredited Hutchinson in the eyes of the people; the Assembly petitioned for his recall. [[Benjamin Franklin]], postmaster general for the colonies, acknowledged that he leaked the letters, which led to him being berated by British officials and fired from his job.

Meanwhile, Parliament passed the [[Tea Act]] to lower the price of taxed tea exported to the colonies in order to help the [[East India Company]] undersell smuggled Dutch tea. Special consignees were appointed to sell the tea in order to bypass colonial merchants. The act was opposed by those who resisted the taxes and also by smugglers who stood to lose business.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}} In most instances, the consignees were forced to resign and the tea was turned back, but Massachusetts governor Hutchinson refused to allow Boston merchants to give in to pressure. A town meeting in Boston determined that the tea would not be landed, and ignored a demand from the governor to disperse. On December 16, 1773, a group of men, led by Samuel Adams and dressed to evoke the appearance of American Indians, boarded the ships of the [[East India Company|British East India Company]] and dumped £10,000 worth of tea from their holds (approximately £636,000 in 2008) into Boston Harbor. Decades later, this event became known as the [[Boston Tea Party]] and remains a significant part of American patriotic lore.<ref>Benjamin L.

The British government responded by passing several Acts which came to be known as the [[Intolerable Acts]], which further darkened colonial opinion towards the British. They consisted of four laws enacted by the British parliament.<ref>Miller (1943) pp. 353–76
</ref> The first was the [[Massachusetts Government Act]] which altered the Massachusetts charter and restricted town meetings. The second act was the [[Administration of Justice Act 1774|Administration of Justice Act]] which ordered that all British soldiers to be tried were to be arraigned in Britain, not in the colonies. The third Act was the [[Boston Port Act]], which closed the port of Boston until the British had been compensated for the tea lost in the Boston Tea Party. The fourth Act was the [[Quartering Acts|Quartering Act of 1774]], which allowed royal governors to house British troops in the homes of citizens without requiring permission of the owner.<ref>Carp, ''Defiance of the Patriots: The Boston Tea Party and the Making of America'' (2010) ch 9</ref>

In response, Massachusetts patriots issued the [[Suffolk Resolves]] and formed an alternative shadow government known as the "Provincial Congress" which began training militia outside British-occupied Boston.<ref>{{cite book|author=John K.

During secret debates, conservative [[Joseph Galloway]] proposed the creation of a colonial Parliament that would be able to approve or disapprove of acts of the British Parliament, but his idea was not accepted. The Congress instead endorsed the proposal of John Adams that Americans would obey Parliament voluntarily but would resist all taxes in disguise. Congress called for a boycott beginning on 1 December 1774 of all British goods; it was enforced by new committees authorized by the Congress.<ref>{{cite book|author=Mary Beth Norton|title=A People and a Nation: A History of the United States|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eT-HM6ruYTwC&pg=PA143|year=2010|publisher=Cengage Learning|page=143|display-authors=etal|isbn=0495915254}}

Massachusetts was declared in a state of rebellion in February 1775 and the British garrison received orders to disarm the rebels and arrest their leaders, leading to the [[Battles of Lexington and Concord]] on 19 April 1775. The Patriots laid siege to Boston, expelled royal officials from all the colonies, and took control through the establishment of [[Provincial Congress]]es. The [[Battle of Bunker Hill]] followed on June 17, 1775. It was a British victory—but at a great cost: about 1,000 British casualties from a garrison of about 6,000, as compared to 500 American casualties from a much larger force.<ref>Harvey. ''"A few bloody noses"'' (2002) pp. 208–210</ref><ref>Urban p.74</ref> The Second Continental Congress was divided on the best course of action, but eventually produced the [[Olive Branch Petition]], in which they attempted to come to an accord with [[George III of the United Kingdom|King George]]. The king, however, issued a [[Proclamation of Rebellion]] which stated that the states were "in rebellion" and the members of Congress were traitors.

In the winter of 1775, the Americans [[Invasion of Canada (1775)|invaded Canada]] under generals [[Benedict Arnold]] and [[Richard Montgomery]]. The attack was a complete failure; many Americans who weren't killed were either captured or died of smallpox.

In March 1776, the Continental Army forced the British to [[Evacuation Day (Massachusetts)|evacuate Boston]], with George Washington as the commander of the new army. The revolutionaries were now in full control of all 13 colonies and were ready to declare independence. There still were many Loyalists, but they were no longer in control anywhere by July 1776, and all of the Royal officials had fled.<ref>Miller (1948) p. 87</ref>

==Creating new state constitutions==
Following the [[Battle of Bunker Hill]] in June 1775, the Patriots had control of Massachusetts outside the Boston city limits, and the Loyalists suddenly found themselves on the defensive with no protection from the British army. In all 13 colonies, Patriots had overthrown their existing governments, closing courts and driving away British officials. They had elected conventions and "legislatures" that existed outside any legal framework; new constitutions were drawn up in each state to supersede royal charters. They declared that they were states now, not colonies.<ref name = "Pole-ch29">Nevins (1927); Greene and Pole (1994) chapter 29</ref>

On January 5, 1776, [[Province of New Hampshire|New Hampshire]] ratified the first state constitution. In May 1776, Congress voted to suppress all forms of crown authority, to be replaced by locally created authority. Virginia, [[Province of South Carolina|South Carolina]], and New Jersey created their constitutions before July 4. [[Colony of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations|Rhode Island]] and [[Connecticut Colony|Connecticut]] simply took their existing [[royal charter]]s and deleted all references to the crown.<ref>Nevins (1927)</ref> The new states were all committed to republicanism, with no inherited offices. They decided what form of government to create, and also how to select those who would craft the constitutions and how the resulting document would be ratified. On 26 May 1776, [[John Adams]] wrote James Sullivan from Philadelphia:

"Depend upon it, sir, it is dangerous to open so fruitful a source of controversy and altercation, as would be opened by attempting to alter the qualifications of voters. There will be no end of it. New claims will arise. Women will demand a vote. Lads from twelve to twenty one will think their rights not enough attended to, and every man, who has not a farthing, will demand an equal voice with any other in all acts of state. It tends to confound and destroy all distinctions, and prostrate all ranks, to one common level".<ref>Founding the Republic: A Documentary History; edited by John J. Patrick</ref><ref>Reason, Religion, and Democracy: Dennis C. Muelle. p. 206</ref>

The resulting constitutions in states such as [[Province of Maryland|Maryland]], Virginia, [[Delaware Colony|Delaware]], New York, and [[Constitution of Massachusetts|Massachusetts]]<ref>Massachusetts' constitution is still in force in the 21st century, continuously since its ratification on June 15, 1780</ref> featured:
* Property qualifications for voting and even more substantial requirements for elected positions (though New York and Maryland lowered property qualifications)<ref name = "Pole-ch29"/>
* [[Bicameral legislature]]s, with the upper house as a check on the lower
* Strong [[governor]]s with veto power over the legislature and substantial appointment authority
* Few or no restraints on individuals holding multiple positions in government
* The continuation of [[Established church|state-established religion]]

In Pennsylvania, New Jersey, and New Hampshire, the resulting constitutions embodied:
* universal manhood suffrage, or minimal property requirements for voting or holding office (New Jersey enfranchised some property-owning widows, a step that it retracted 25 years later)
* strong, [[Unicameralism|unicameral legislatures]]
* relatively weak governors without veto powers, and with little appointing authority
* prohibition against individuals holding multiple government posts

The radical provisions of Pennsylvania's constitution lasted only 14 years. In 1790, conservatives gained power in the state legislature, called a new constitutional convention, and rewrote the constitution. The new constitution substantially reduced universal male suffrage, gave the governor veto power and patronage appointment authority, and added an upper house with substantial wealth qualifications to the unicameral legislature. Thomas Paine called it a constitution unworthy of America.<ref name="Wood, 1992"/>

==Independence and Union==

{{Further|Lee Resolution|Articles of Confederation|Committee of Five|United States Declaration of Independence}}

In April 1776, the [[North Carolina Provincial Congress]] issued the [[Halifax Resolves]] explicitly authorizing its delegates to vote for independence.<ref>Jensen, ''The Founding of a Nation'' (1968) pp. 678–79</ref> In May, Congress called on all the states to write constitutions and eliminate the last remnants of royal rule. By June, nine colonies were ready for independence; one by one, the last four fell into line: Pennsylvania, Delaware, Maryland, and New York. [[Richard Henry Lee]] was instructed by the Virginia legislature to propose independence, and he did so on June 7, 1776. On June 11, a committee was created to draft a document explaining the justifications for separation from Britain. After securing enough votes for passage, independence was voted for on July 2.

The [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]] was drafted largely by [[Thomas Jefferson]] and presented by the committee; it was unanimously adopted by the entire Congress on July 4,<ref>Maier, ''American Scripture'' (1997) pp. 41–46</ref> and each of the colonies became independent and autonomous. The next step was to form a union to facilitate international relations and alliances.<ref>Armitage, David. ''The Declaration of Independence: A Global History.'' Harvard University Press, London. 2007.

The Second Continental Congress approved the "Articles of Confederation" for ratification by the states on November 15, 1777; the Congress immediately began operating under the Articles' terms, providing a structure of shared sovereignty during prosecution of the war and facilitating international relations and alliances with France and Spain. The articles were ratified on March 1, 1781.  At that point, the Continental Congress was dissolved and a new government of the [[Congress of the Confederation|United States in Congress Assembled]] took its place on the following day, with [[Samuel Huntington (statesman)|Samuel Huntington]] as presiding officer.<ref>Greene and Pole (1994) chapter 30</ref><ref>Klos, ''President Who?

===British return: 1776–1777===
{{Further|New York and New Jersey campaign|Staten Island Peace Conference|Saratoga campaign|Philadelphia campaign}}
According to British historian [[Jeremy Black (historian)|Jeremy Black]], the British had significant advantages, including a highly trained army, the world's largest navy, and a highly efficient system of public finance that could easily fund the war. However, the British were seriously handicapped by their misunderstanding of the depth of support for the Patriot position. Ignoring the advice of General Gage, they misinterpreted the situation as merely a large-scale riot. London decided that they could overawe the Americans by sending a large military and naval force, forcing them to be loyal again:

{{quote|Convinced that the Revolution was the work of a full few miscreants who had rallied an armed rabble to their cause, they expected that the revolutionaries would be intimidated.... Then the vast majority of Americans, who were loyal but cowed by the terroristic tactics... would rise up, kick out the rebels, and restore loyal government in each colony.<ref>Jeremy Black, ''Crisis of Empire: Britain and America in the Eighteenth Century'' (2008) p. 140</ref>}}

Washington forced the British out of Boston in the spring of 1776, and neither the British nor the Loyalists controlled any significant areas. The British, however, were massing forces at their naval base at [[Halifax Regional Municipality|Halifax, Nova Scotia]]. They returned in force in July 1776, landing in New York and defeating Washington's Continental Army in August at the [[Battle of Long Island|Battle of Brooklyn]]. Following that victory, the British requested a meeting with representatives from Congress to negotiate an end to hostilities.<ref name="Schecter, Barnet 2002">Schecter, Barnet. ''The Battle for New York: The City at the Heart of the American Revolution''. (2002)</ref><ref name="McCullough, 1776 2005">McCullough, ''1776'' (2005)</ref>

A delegation including John Adams and Benjamin Franklin met [[Richard Howe, 1st Earl Howe|Howe]] on [[Staten Island]] in New York Harbor on September 11, in what became known as the [[Staten Island Peace Conference]]. Howe demanded a retraction of the Declaration of Independence, which was refused, and negotiations ended. The British then [[Battle of Kip's Bay|quickly seized New York City]] and nearly captured Washington's army. They made New York their main political and military base of operations in North America, [[Evacuation Day (New York)|holding it until November 1783]]. The city became the destination for Loyalist refugees and a focal point of Washington's [[Intelligence in the American Revolutionary War|intelligence network]].<ref name="Schecter, Barnet 2002"/><ref name="McCullough, 1776 2005"/>

The British also took New Jersey, pushing the Continental Army into Pennsylvania. Washington [[Washington's crossing of the Delaware|crossed the Delaware River]] back into New Jersey in a surprise attack in late December 1776 and defeated [[Hessian (soldier)|Hessian]] and British armies at [[Battle of Trenton|Trenton]] and [[Battle of Princeton|Princeton]], thereby regaining control of most of New Jersey. The victories gave an important boost to Patriots at a time when morale was flagging, and have become iconic events of the war.

In 1777, the British sent Burgoyne's invasion force from Canada south to New York to seal off New England. Their aim was to neutralize the [[Yankee#Early usage|Yankees]], whom the British perceived as the primary source of agitators. The British army in New York City went to Philadelphia in a major case of mis-coordination, capturing it from Washington. The invasion army under [[John Burgoyne|Burgoyne]] was much too slow and became trapped in northern New York state. It surrendered after the [[Battles of Saratoga]] in October 1777. From early October 1777 until November 15, a siege distracted British troops at [[Fort Mifflin]], Philadelphia, Pennsylvania and allowed Washington time to preserve the Continental Army by safely leading his troops to harsh winter quarters at [[Valley Forge]].

===Prisoners===
{{Main|Prisoners of war in the American Revolutionary War}}
In August 1775, George III declared Americans in arms against royal authority to be traitors to the Crown. Following their surrender at the [[Battles of Saratoga]] in October 1777, there were thousands of British and Hessian soldiers in American hands. Although Lord Germain took a hard line, the British generals on the scene never held treason trials; they treated captured enemy soldiers as [[prisoners of war]].<ref>Alan Valentine, ''Lord George Germain'' (1962) pp.&nbsp;309–10</ref> The dilemma was that tens of thousands of Loyalists were under American control and American retaliation would have been easy. The British built much of their strategy around using these Loyalists,<ref name="Larry G. Bowman 1976">Larry G. Bowman, ''Captive Americans: Prisoners During the American Revolution'' (1976)</ref> and therefore, no Americans were put on trial for treason. The British maltreated the prisoners whom they held, resulting in more deaths to American sailors and soldiers than from combat operations.<ref name="Larry G. Bowman 1976"/> At the end of the war, both sides released their surviving prisoners.<ref>John C. Miller, ''Triumph of Freedom, 1775–1783'' (1948) p. 166.</ref>

===American alliances after 1778===
{{Further|France in the American Revolutionary War|Spain in the American Revolutionary War}}

The capture of a British army at Saratoga encouraged the French to formally enter the war in support of Congress. Benjamin Franklin negotiated a permanent military alliance in early 1778, significantly becoming the first country to officially recognize the Declaration of Independence. On February 6, 1778, a [[Treaty of Amity and Commerce (USA–France)|Treaty of Amity and Commerce]] and a [[Treaty of Alliance (1778)|Treaty of Alliance]] were signed between the United States and France.<ref name="Hamilton, 1974 p. 28">Hamilton, ''The Papers of Alexander Hamilton'' (1974) p. 28</ref> [[William Pitt, 1st Earl of Chatham|William Pitt]] spoke out in parliament urging Britain to make peace in America and to unite with America against France, while other British politicians who had previously sympathized with colonial grievances now turned against the Americans for allying with Britain's international rival and enemy.<ref>Stanley Weintraub, ''Iron Tears: America's Battle for Freedom, Britain's Quagmire, 1775–1783'' (2005) p. 151</ref>

Later, Spain (in 1779) and the [[Dutch Republic|Dutch]] (1780) became allies of the French, leaving the British Empire to fight a global war alone without major allies, and requiring it to slip through a combined blockade of the Atlantic. The American theater thus became only one front in Britain's war.<ref>Mackesy, ''The War for America'' (1993) p. 568</ref> The British were forced to withdraw troops from continental America to reinforce the valuable sugar-producing Caribbean colonies, which were more lucrative to British investors.

British commander [[Henry Clinton (American War of Independence)|Sir Henry Clinton]] evacuated Philadelphia and returned to New York City. General Washington intercepted Clinton in the [[Battle of Monmouth|Battle of Monmouth Court House]], the last major battle fought in the north. After an inconclusive engagement, the British successfully retreated to New York City. The northern war subsequently became a stalemate, as the focus of attention shifted to the smaller southern theater.<ref name="Higginbotham, 1983 p. 83">Higginbotham, ''The War of American Independence'' (1983) p. 83</ref>

===The British move South, 1778–1783===
{{Further|Southern theater of the American Revolutionary War|Naval operations in the American Revolutionary War}}

The British strategy in America now concentrated on a campaign in the southern states. With fewer regular troops at their disposal, the British commanders saw the "southern strategy" as a more viable plan, as the south was perceived as being more strongly Loyalist, with a large population of recent immigrants as well as large numbers of slaves who might be captured or run away to join the British.<ref>Crow and Tise, ''The Southern Experience in the American Revolution'' (1978) p.&nbsp;157–9</ref>

Beginning in late December 1778, the British captured [[Savannah, Georgia|Savannah]] and controlled the [[Province of Georgia|Georgia]] coastline. In 1780, they launched a fresh invasion and [[Siege of Charleston|took Charleston]], as well. A significant victory at the [[Battle of Camden]] meant that royal forces soon controlled most of Georgia and South Carolina. The British set up a network of forts inland, hoping that the Loyalists would rally to the flag.<ref name="Henry Lumpkin 2000">Henry Lumpkin, ''From Savannah to Yorktown: The American Revolution in the South'' (2000)</ref>

Not enough Loyalists turned out, however, and the British had to fight their way north into North Carolina and Virginia, with a severely weakened army. Behind them, much of the territory that they had already captured dissolved into a chaotic [[guerrilla war]], fought predominantly between bands of Loyalist and American militia, which negated many of the gains that the British had previously made.<ref name="Henry Lumpkin 2000"/>

====Surrender at Yorktown (1781)====
{{Main|Siege of Yorktown}}

[[File:John Trumbull - The Surrender of Lord Cornwallis at Yorktown, October 19, 1781 - 1832.4 - Yale University Art Gallery.jpg|thumb|upright=1.25|alt=The Siege of Yorktown ended with the surrender of a second British army, paving the way for the end of the American Revolutionary War|''[[Surrender of Lord Cornwallis]]'' by [[John Trumbull]]<center>The [[siege of Yorktown]] ended with the surrender of a second British army, marking effective British defeat.</center>]]

The British army under Cornwallis marched to [[Yorktown, Virginia]] where they expected to be rescued by a British fleet.<ref>Brendan Morrissey, ''Yorktown 1781: The World Turned Upside Down'' (1997)</ref> The fleet showed up, but so did a larger French fleet, so the British fleet returned to New York for reinforcements after the [[Battle of the Chesapeake]], leaving Cornwallis trapped. In October 1781, the British surrendered their second invading army of the war, under a siege by the combined French and Continental armies commanded by Washington.<ref>Harvey pp. 493–515</ref>

===The end of the war===
Historians continue to debate whether the odds for American victory were long or short. [[John E. Ferling]] says that the odds were so long that the American victory was  "almost a miracle".<ref>John Ferling, ''Almost A Miracle: The American Victory in the War of Independence'' (2009)</ref> On the other hand, [[Joseph Ellis]] says that the odds favored the Americans, and asks whether there ever was any realistic chance for the British to win. He argues that this opportunity came only once, in the summer of 1776, and the British failed that test. Admiral Howe and his brother General Howe "missed several opportunities to destroy the Continental Army.... Chance, luck, and even the vagaries of the weather played crucial roles." Ellis's point is that the strategic and tactical decisions of the Howes were fatally flawed because they underestimated the challenges posed by the Patriots. Ellis concludes that, once the Howe brothers failed, the opportunity for a British victory "would never come again."<ref>{{cite book|author=Joseph J. Ellis|title=Revolutionary Summer: The Birth of American Independence|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=z4RqZJzho1QC&pg=PR11|year=2013|publisher=Random House|page=11}}</ref>

Support for the conflict had never been strong in Britain, where many sympathized with the Americans, but now it reached a new low.<ref>Harvey p.528</ref> King George III personally wanted to fight on, but his supporters lost control of Parliament and no further major land offensives were launched in the American Theater.<ref name="Higginbotham, 1983 p. 83"/><ref>A final naval battle was fought on March 10, 1783 by Captain [[John Barry (naval officer)|John Barry]] and the crew of the [[USS Alliance (1778)|USS ''Alliance'']], who defeated three British warships led by HMS ''Sybille''.

Washington could not know that the British would not reopen hostilities after Yorktown. They still had 26,000 troops occupying New York City, Charleston, and Savannah, together with a powerful fleet. The French army and navy departed, so the Americans were on their own in 1782–83.<ref>Jonathan R. Dull, ''The French Navy and American Independence'' (1975) p. 248</ref> The treasury was empty, and the unpaid soldiers were growing restive, almost to the point of mutiny or possible ''coup d'état''.

Kohn, ''Eagle and Sword: The Federalists and the Creation of the Military Establishment in America, 1783–1802'' (1975) pp. 17–39</ref>

==Paris peace treaty==

{{Main|Treaty of Paris (1783)}}
During negotiations in Paris, the American delegation discovered that France would support independence, but no territorial gains. The new nation would be confined to the area east of the Appalachian Mountains. The American delegation opened direct secret negotiations with London, cutting the French out. British Prime Minister [[William Petty, 2nd Earl of Shelburne|Lord Shelburne]] was in full charge of the British negotiations. He now saw a chance to make the United States a valuable economic partner.<ref>Charles R. Ritcheson, "The Earl of Shelbourne and Peace with America, 1782–1783: Vision and Reality." ''International History Review'' 5#3 (1983): 322–45.</ref>  The US obtained all the land east of the Mississippi River, south of Canada, and north of Florida. It gained fishing rights off Canadian coasts, and agreed to allow British merchants and Loyalists to try to recover their property. It was a highly favorable treaty for the United States, and deliberately so from the British point of view. Prime Minister Shelburne foresaw highly profitable two-way trade between Britain and the rapidly growing United States, as indeed came to pass. Since the blockade was lifted and the old imperial restrictions were gone, American merchants were free to trade with any nation anywhere in the world, and their businesses flourished.<ref>{{cite book|author=Jonathan R. Dull|title=A Diplomatic History of the American Revolution|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=W86WS9Z0ycYC&pg=PA144|year=1987|publisher=Yale up|pages=144–51}}</ref>

The British largely abandoned the Indian allies living in the new nation. They were not a party to this treaty and did not recognize it until they were defeated militarily by the United States. However, the British did promise to support the Indians. They sold them munitions and maintained forts in American territory until the [[Jay Treaty]] of 1795.<ref>{{cite book|author=William Deverell, ed.|title=A Companion to the American West|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=B3q_0ZgquK4C&pg=PA17|year=2008|page=17}}</ref>

Losing the war and the Thirteen Colonies was a shock to Britain. The war revealed the limitations of Britain's [[fiscal-military state]] when they discovered that they suddenly faced powerful enemies with no allies, and they were dependent on extended and vulnerable transatlantic lines of communication. The defeat heightened dissension and escalated political antagonism to the King's ministers. Inside Parliament, the primary concern changed from fears of an over-mighty monarch to the issues of representation, parliamentary reform, and government retrenchment. Reformers sought to destroy what they saw as widespread institutional corruption.<ref name="William Hague 2004">William Hague, ''William Pitt the Younger'' (2004)</ref><ref name="Jeremy Black 2006">Jeremy Black, ''George III: America's Last King''(2006)</ref>

The result was a powerful crisis from 1776 to 1783. The peace in 1783 left France financially prostrate, while the British economy boomed thanks to the return of American business. The crisis ended after 1784 thanks to the King's shrewdness in outwitting [[Charles James Fox]] (the leader of the [[Fox-North Coalition]]), and renewed confidence in the system engendered by the leadership of the new Prime Minister [[William Pitt the Younger|William Pitt]]. Historians conclude that loss of the American colonies enabled Britain to deal with the [[French Revolution]] with more unity and better organization than would otherwise have been the case.<ref name="William Hague 2004"/><ref name="Jeremy Black 2006"/> Britain turned towards Asia, the Pacific and later Africa with subsequent exploration leading to the rise of the [[Second British Empire]].<ref>[[#refOHBEv1|Canny]], p.&nbsp;92.</ref>

==Finance==
Britain's war against the Americans, French, and Spanish cost about £100 million. The Treasury borrowed 40% of the money that it needed.<ref>Paul Kennedy, ''The Rise and Fall of the Great Powers'' (1987) pp. 81, 119</ref> Heavy spending brought France to the [[Causes of the French Revolution#Economics and finances|verge of bankruptcy and revolution]], while the British had relatively little difficulty financing their war, keeping their suppliers and soldiers paid, and hiring tens of thousands of German soldiers.<ref name="John Brewer 1990 p 91">John Brewer, ''The sinews of power: war, money, and the English state, 1688–1783'' (1990) p. 91</ref>

Britain had a sophisticated financial system based on the wealth of thousands of landowners, who supported the government, together with banks and financiers in London. The British tax system collected about 12 percent of the GDP in taxes during the 1770s.<ref name="John Brewer 1990 p 91"/>

Nettels, ''The Emergence of a National Economy, 1775–1815'' (1962) pp. 23–44</ref> In 1775, there was at most 12 million dollars in gold in the colonies, not nearly enough to cover current transactions, let alone finance a major war. The British made the situation much worse by imposing a tight blockade on every American port, which cut off almost all imports and exports. One partial solution was to rely on volunteer support from militiamen and donations from patriotic citizens.<ref name="Charles Rappleye 2010 pp 225">Charles Rappleye, ''Robert Morris: Financier of the American Revolution'' (2010) pp. 225–52</ref><ref>Edwin J.

Indeed, the soldiers and officers were given land grants in 1783 to cover the wages that they had earned but had not been paid during the war. Not until 1781 did the national government have a strong leader in financial matters, when [[Robert Morris (financier)|Robert Morris]] was named [[Superintendent of Finance of the United States]].<ref name="Charles Rappleye 2010 pp 225"/>

Morris used a French loan in 1782 to set up the private [[Bank of North America]] to finance the war. Seeking greater efficiency, Morris reduced the civil list, saved money by using competitive bidding for contracts, tightened accounting procedures, and demanded the national government's full share of money and supplies from the confederated states.<ref name="Charles Rappleye 2010 pp 225"/>

Congress used four main methods to cover the cost of the war, which cost about 66 million dollars in specie (gold and silver).<ref>Oliver Harry Chitwood, ''A History of Colonial America'' (1961) pp. 586–89</ref> Congress made two issues of paper money—in 1775–1780 and in 1780–81. The first issue amounted to 242 million dollars. This paper money would supposedly be redeemed for state taxes, but the holders were eventually paid off in 1791 at the rate of one cent on the dollar. By 1780, the paper money was "not worth a Continental", as people said.<ref>{{cite book|author=Terry M. Mays|title=Historical Dictionary of Revolutionary America|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QAgEVl8wQmsC&pg=PA73|year=2005|publisher=Scarecrow Press|pages=73–75}}</ref>

The skyrocketing inflation was a hardship on the few people who had fixed incomes—but 90 percent of the people were farmers, and were not directly affected by that inflation. Debtors benefited by paying off their debts with depreciated paper. The greatest burden was borne by the soldiers of the Continental Army, whose wages were usually in arrears and declined in value every month, weakening their morale and adding to the hardships of their families.<ref>Ralph Volney Harlow, "Aspects of Revolutionary Finance, 1775–1783," ''American Historical Review'' (1929) 35#1 pp. 46–68 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1838471 in JSTOR]</ref>

Beginning in 1777, Congress repeatedly asked the states to provide money. But the states had no system of taxation either, and were little help. By 1780, Congress was making requisitions for specific supplies of corn, beef, pork, and other necessities—an inefficient system that kept the army barely alive.<ref>Erna Risch, ''Supplying Washington's Army'' (1982)</ref><ref>E. Wayne Carp, ''To Starve the Army at Pleasure: Continental Army Administration and American Political Culture, 1775–1783'' (1990)</ref>

Starting in 1776, the Congress sought to raise money by loans from wealthy individuals, promising to redeem the bonds after the war. The bonds were in fact redeemed in 1791 at face value, but the scheme raised little money because Americans had little specie, and many of the rich merchants were supporters of the Crown. Starting in 1776, the French secretly supplied the Americans with money, gunpowder, and munitions in order to weaken its arch enemy Great Britain. When France officially entered the war in 1778, the subsidies continued, and the French government, as well as bankers in Paris and Amsterdam, lent large sums to the American war effort. These loans were repaid in full in the 1790s.<ref>E. James Ferguson, ''The power of the purse: A history of American public finance, 1776–1790'' (1961)</ref>

The war finally ended in 1783 and was followed by a period of prosperity. The national government was still operating under the Articles of Confederation and was able to settle the issue of the western territories, which were ceded by the states to Congress. American settlers moved rapidly into those areas, with Vermont, Kentucky, and Tennessee becoming states in the 1790s.<ref>Greene and Pole, eds. ''Companion to the American Revolution,'' pp. 557–624</ref>

However, the national government had no money to pay either the war debts owed to European nations and the private banks, or to pay Americans who had been given millions of dollars of promissory notes for supplies during the war. Nationalists led by Washington, Alexander Hamilton, and other veterans feared that the new nation was too fragile to withstand an international war, or even internal revolts such as the [[Shays' Rebellion]] of 1786 in Massachusetts.

Calling themselves "Federalists," the nationalists convinced Congress to call the [[Philadelphia Convention]] in 1787.<ref>Richard B. Morris, ''The Forging of the Union: 1781–1789'' (1987) pp. 245–66</ref> It adopted a new [[Constitution of the United States|Constitution]] that provided for a much stronger federal government, including an effective executive in a [[Separation of powers|check-and-balance]] system with the judiciary and legislature.<ref>Morris, ''The Forging of the Union: 1781–1789'' pp. 300–13</ref> The Constitution was ratified in 1788, after a fierce debate in the states over the nature of the proposed new government. The new government under President George Washington took office in New York in March 1789.<ref>Morris, ''The Forging of the Union, 1781–1789'' pp. 300–22</ref> Amendments to the Constitution were spearheaded in Congress by [[James Madison]] as assurances to those who were cautious about federal power, guaranteeing many of the [[inalienable rights]] that formed a foundation for the revolution. The amendments were ratified by the states in 1791.

===National debt===

{{Further|United States public debt|Alexander Hamilton}}

The national debt fell into three categories after the American Revolution. The first was the $12 million owed to foreigners, mostly money borrowed from France. There was general agreement to pay the foreign debts at full value. The national government owed $40 million and state governments owed $25 million to Americans who had sold food, horses, and supplies to the revolutionary forces. There were also other debts that consisted of [[promissory note]]s issued during the Revolutionary War to soldiers, merchants, and farmers who accepted these payments on the premise that the new Constitution would create a government that would pay these debts eventually.

The war expenses of the individual states added up to $114 million compared to $37 million by the central government.<ref>Jensen, ''The New Nation'' (1950) p. 379</ref> In 1790, Congress combined the remaining state debts with the foreign and domestic debts into one national debt totaling $80 million at the recommendation of first Secretary of the Treasury [[Alexander Hamilton]].  Everyone received face value for wartime certificates, so that the national honor would be sustained and the national credit established.<ref>Joseph J. Ellis, ''His Excellency: George Washington'' (2004) p. 204</ref>

==Ideology and factions==
The population of the 13 Colonies was not homogeneous in their political views and attitudes. Loyalties and allegiances varied widely within regions and communities and even within families, and sometimes shifted during the course of the Revolution.

===Ideology behind the Revolution===
{{Main| Age of Enlightenment | American Enlightenment|Liberalism in the United States|Republicanism in the United States}}
The American Enlightenment was a critical precursor of the American Revolution. Chief among the ideas of the American Enlightenment were the concepts of Natural Law, Natural Rights, Consent of the Governed, Individualism, Property Rights, Self-Ownership, Self-Determination, liberalism, republicanism and fear of corruption. Collectively, the acceptance of these concepts by a growing number of American colonists began to foster an intellectual environment which would lead to a new sense of political and social identity.<ref>Robert A. Ferguson, ''The American Enlightenment, 1750–1820'' (1997).</ref>

[[File:J S Copley - Samuel Adams.jpg|thumb|left|alt=John Adams is a stern middle-aged man with gray hair is wearing a dark red suit.

[[John Locke]]'s (1632–1704) ideas on liberty influenced the political thinking behind the revolution, especially through his indirect influence on English writers such as [[John Trenchard (writer)|John Trenchard]], [[Thomas Gordon (writer)|Thomas Gordon]], and [[Benjamin Hoadly]], whose political ideas in turn had a strong influence on the American revolutionaries.<ref>Middlekauff (2005), pp. 136–38</ref> Locke is often referred to as "the philosopher of the American Revolution" due to his work in the Social Contract and Natural Rights theories that underpinned the Revolution's political ideology.<ref>{{cite book|author=Jeffrey D. Schultz|title=Encyclopedia of Religion in American Politics|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dy1MNv8ou-0C&pg=PA148|year=1999|publisher=Greenwood|page=148|display-authors=etal}}</ref> Locke's [[Two Treatises of Government]] published in 1689 were especially influential. He argued that all humans were created equally free, and governments therefore needed the "consent of the governed."<ref>Waldron (2002), p. 136</ref>  In late eighteenth-century America, belief was still widespread in "equality by creation" and "rights by creation".<ref>Thomas S. Kidd (2010): ''God of Liberty: A Religious History of the American Revolution'', New York, pp. 6–7</ref>

The theory of the "[[social contract]]" influenced the belief among many of the Founders that among the "natural rights" of man was the [[Right of revolution|right of the people to overthrow their leaders]], should those leaders betray the historic [[rights of Englishmen]].<ref name=Toth1989>Charles W. Toth, ''Liberte, Egalite, Fraternite: The American Revolution and the European Response.''

====Republicanism====
{{main| Republicanism in the United States}}
{{Republicanism sidebar}}
A central motivating force behind the overthrow of monarchy and aristocracy was the American embrace of a political ideology called "republicanism",{{citation needed|date=June 2017}} which was dominant in the colonies by 1775 but of minor importance back in Great Britain.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}} The republicanism was inspired by the "[[Whig (British political party)|country party]]" in Great Britain, whose critique of British government emphasized that [[political corruption|corruption]] was a terrible reality in Great Britain.<ref name= Weintraub2005>Stanley Weintraub, ''Iron Tears: America's Battle for Freedom, Britain's Quagmire, 1775–1783'' (2005) chapter 1</ref> Americans feared that the corruption was crossing the Atlantic; the commitment of most Americans to republican values and to their rights energized the revolution, as Britain was increasingly seen as hopelessly corrupt and hostile to American interests. Britain seemed to threaten the established liberties that Americans enjoyed.<ref>Bailyn, '' The Ideological Origins of the American Revolution'' (1992) pp. 125–37</ref> The greatest threat to liberty was depicted as corruption—not just in London but at home, as well. The colonists associated it with luxury, and especially with inherited aristocracy, which they condemned.<ref>Wood, ''The Radicalism of the American Revolution'' (1992) pp. 35, 174–75</ref>

The Founding Fathers were strong advocates of republican values, particularly [[Samuel Adams]], [[Patrick Henry]], [[John Adams]], [[Benjamin Franklin]], [[Thomas Jefferson]], [[Thomas Paine]], [[George Washington]], [[James Madison]], and [[Alexander Hamilton]],<ref>Shalhope, ''Toward a Republican Synthesis'' (1972) pp. 49–80</ref> which required men to put civic duty ahead of their personal desires. Men had a civic duty to be prepared and willing to fight for the rights and liberties of their countrymen. John Adams wrote to [[Mercy Otis Warren]] in 1776, agreeing with some [[Classical antiquity|classical]] Greek and Roman thinkers in that "Public Virtue cannot exist without private, and public Virtue is the only Foundation of Republics." He continued: {{quote|"There must be a positive Passion for the public good, the public Interest, Honour, Power, and Glory, established in the Minds of the People, or there can be no Republican Government, nor any real Liberty. And this public Passion must be Superior to all private Passions. Men must be ready, they must pride themselves, and be happy to sacrifice their private Pleasures, Passions, and Interests, nay their private Friendships and dearest connections, when they Stand in Competition with the Rights of society."<ref name=Rahe1994>Adams quoted in Paul A. Rahe, ''Republics Ancient and Modern: Classical Republicanism and the American Revolution. Volume: 2'' (1994) p. 23.</ref>}}

For women, "[[republican motherhood]]" became the ideal, exemplified by [[Abigail Adams]] and [[Mercy Otis Warren]]; the first duty of the republican woman was to instill republican values in her children and to avoid luxury and ostentation.<ref>Linda K. Kerber, ''Women of the Republic: Intellect and Ideology in Revolutionary America'' (1997).</ref>

[[File:commonsense.jpg|thumb|alt=Thomas Paine's pamphlet Common Sense, published in 1776|<center>[[Thomas Paine]]'s pamphlet ''[[Common Sense (pamphlet)|Common Sense]]'', published in 1776</center>]]
Some republics had emerged throughout history, such as the [[Roman Republic]] of the ancient world, but none ever existed that was based on liberal principles. Thomas Paine's pamphlet ''[[Common Sense (pamphlet)|Common Sense]]'' appeared in January 1776, after the Revolution had started. It was widely distributed and loaned, and often read aloud in [[Tavern#North America|taverns]], contributing significantly to spreading the ideas of republicanism and liberalism together, bolstering enthusiasm for separation from Great Britain, and encouraging recruitment for the Continental Army.<ref name="Ferguson, 2000 pp. 465">Ferguson, ''The Commonalities of Common Sense'' (2000) pp. 465–504</ref>

Paine provided a new and widely accepted argument for independence by advocating a complete break with history. ''Common Sense'' is oriented to the future in a way that compels the reader to make an immediate choice. It offered a solution for Americans disgusted and alarmed at the threat of tyranny.<ref name="Ferguson, 2000 pp. 465"/>

====Protestant Dissenters and the Great Awakening====
{{main|English Dissenters|First Great Awakening}}
Dissenting churches of the day (Protestant churches that had separated from the [[Church of England]]) were the "school of democracy", in the words of historian Patricia Bonomi.<ref name=Bonomi>Bonomi, p. 186, Chapter 7 "Religion and the American Revolution</ref> Before the Revolution, the [[Southern Colonies]] and three of the [[New England Colonies]] had [[Christian state|established churches]], either [[Congregationalism in the United States|Congregational]] ([[Province of Massachusetts Bay|Massachusetts Bay]], [[Connecticut Colony|Connecticut]], and [[Province of New Hampshire|New Hampshire]]) or [[Anglicanism|Anglican]] ([[Province of Maryland|Maryland]], [[Colony of Virginia|Virginia]], [[Province of North-Carolina|North-Carolina]], [[Province of South Carolina|South Carolina]], and [[Province of Georgia|Georgia]]), while the [[Middle Colonies]] ([[Province of New York|New York]], [[Province of New Jersey|New Jersey]], [[Province of Pennsylvania|Pennsylvania]], and [[Delaware Colony|Delaware]]) and the [[Colony of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations]] had no established churches.<ref>{{cite book|first1=Oscar T.|last1=Barck|first2=Hugh T.|last2=Lefler|title=Colonial America|publisher=[[Macmillan Publishers (United States)|Macmillan]]|place=New York|year=1958|page=404|quote=At the outbreak of the American Revolution the Congregational Church was still the dominant one in New England; it was the established church in Connecticut, Massachusetts, and New Hampshire...

The colonial churches gathered an entire society within their outstretched arms.}}</ref> what little data exists indicates that even in the colonies where the Church of England was the established church, Anglicans were not in the majority and probably did not comprise even 30 percent of the population (with the possible exception of Virginia).<ref>{{cite book|first1=Oscar T.|last1=Barck|first2=Hugh T.|last2=Lefler|title=Colonial America|publisher=[[Macmillan Publishers (United States)|Macmillan]]|place=New York|year=1958|page=404|quote=In all colonies in the South, plus four counties in [and] around New York City, Anglicanism was established.

By the time of the [[American Revolutionary War]], of the approximately 2,900 churches in the [[Thirteen Colonies]] at the time, 82 to 84 percent were affiliated with non-Anglican Protestant denominations, with 64 to 68 percent specifically affiliated with [[English Dissenters|Protestant Dissenter]] denominations ([[Congregationalism in the United States|Congregational]], [[Presbyterianism in the United States|Presbyterian]], [[Baptists in the United States|Baptist]], or [[Quakers|Quaker]]) and the other 14 to 20 percent being [[Lutheranism|Lutheran]], [[Reformed Church in America|Dutch Reformed]], or [[Reformed Church in the United States|German Reformed]], while 14 to 16 percent remained Anglican but were declining in number, and the remaining 2 percent of the churches were [[Catholic Church in the United States|Catholic]] while there was also a population of approximately 10,000 [[Methodism|Methodists]].<ref>{{cite book|first1=Oscar T.|last1=Barck|first2=Hugh T.|last2=Lefler|title=Colonial America|publisher=[[Macmillan Publishers (United States)|Macmillan]]|place=New York|year=1958|page=404|quote=The number of churches of each denomination at this time has been estimated as follows: Congregational 658; Presbyterian 543; Baptist 498; Anglican 480; Quaker 295; German and Dutch Reformed 251; Lutheran 151; Catholic 50.}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|first1=John Mack|last1=Faragher|title=The Encyclopedia of Colonial and Revolutionary America|publisher=[[Da Capo Press]]|year=1996|pages=358–359|isbn=978-0306806872|quote=In 1780, Congregationalists had the largest number of churches in the country (around 750), with Presbyterians the next largest number at nearly 500...

Anglicans had about 400 churches but, at this point was in retreat rather than advance. Lutherans, next in strength, had about 240 churches, with Quakers and German Reformed each with about 200 meetings or churches. Dutch Reformed churches numbered around 125, with Roman Catholics having a few over 50, almost wholly in Maryland and Pennsylvania. With only five synagogues, Judaism awaited the major immigrations of the 19th century.}}</ref>  With the exception of the Lutheran and the Methodist churches, all of the non-Anglican Protestant churches were [[Ecclesiastical polity|governed]] as [[Congregationalist polity|independent congregations]] or by an [[Presbyterian polity|elected assembly of elders]] known as "[[presbyter]]s."

President [[John Witherspoon]] of the College of New Jersey (now [[Princeton University]]) wrote widely circulated sermons linking the American Revolution to the teachings of the Bible. Throughout the colonies, dissenting Protestant ministers (Congregational, Baptist, and Presbyterian) preached Revolutionary themes in their sermons, while most Church of England clergymen preached loyalty to the king, the titular head of the English state church.<ref name=Nelson1961>William H. Nelson, ''The American Tory'' (1961) p. 186</ref> Religious motivation for fighting tyranny transcended socioeconomic lines to encompass rich and poor, men and women, frontiersmen and townsmen, farmers and merchants.<ref name=Bonomi/>

The Declaration also referred to the "Laws of Nature and of Nature's God" as justification for the Americans' separation from the British monarchy. Most eighteenth-century Americans believed that nature, the entire universe, was God's creation<ref>Middlekauff (2005), pp.&nbsp;3–6</ref> and he was "Nature's God". Everything, including man, was part of the "universal order of things", which began with God and was directed by his providence.<ref>Middlekauff (2005), pp.&nbsp;3–4</ref> Accordingly, the signers of the Declaration professed their "firm reliance on the Protection of divine Providence", and they appealed to "the Supreme Judge for the rectitude of our intentions".<ref>Kidd (2010), p. 141</ref> Like most of his countrymen, [[George Washington]] was firmly convinced that he was an instrument of providence, to the benefit of the American people and of all humanity.<ref>Middlekauff (2005), p. 302</ref>

Historian [[Bernard Bailyn]] argues that the evangelicalism of the era challenged traditional notions of natural hierarchy by preaching that the Bible teaches that all men are equal, so that the true value of a man lies in his moral behavior, not in his class.<ref>Bailyn,''The Ideological Origins of the American Revolution'' (1992) p. 303</ref> Kidd argues that religious disestablishment, belief in God as the source of human rights, and shared convictions about sin, virtue, and divine providence worked together to unite rationalists and evangelicals and thus encouraged American defiance of the Empire. Bailyn, on the other hand, denies that religion played such a critical role.<ref name="Thomas S. Kidd 2010">Thomas S. Kidd, ''God of Liberty: A Religious History of the American Revolution'' (2010)</ref> Alan Heimert argues that New Light anti-authoritarianism was essential to furthering democracy in colonial American society and set the stage for a confrontation with British monarchical and aristocratic rule.<ref>Alan Heimert, ''Religion and the American Mind: From the Great Awakening to the Revolution''.

===Class and psychology of the factions===
Looking back, John Adams concluded in 1818:

{{quote|The Revolution was effected before the war commenced. The Revolution was in the minds and hearts of the people&nbsp;... This radical change in the principles, opinions, sentiments, and affections of the people was the real American Revolution.<ref>John Ferling, ''Setting the World Ablaze: Washington, Adams, Jefferson, and the American Revolution'' (2002) p. 281</ref>}}

In terms of class, Loyalists tended to have longstanding social and economic connections to British merchants and government; for instance, prominent merchants in major port cities such as New York, Boston and Charleston tended to be Loyalists, as did men involved with the [[fur trade]] along the northern frontier.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}} In addition, officials of colonial government and their staffs, those who had established positions and status to maintain, favored maintaining relations with Great Britain. They often were linked to British families in England by marriage as well.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}

By contrast, Patriots by number tended to be [[Yeoman#United States|yeomen farmers]], especially in the frontier areas of New York and the backcountry of Pennsylvania, Virginia and down the Appalachian mountains.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}} They were craftsmen and small merchants. Leaders of both the Patriots and the Loyalists were men of educated, propertied classes. The Patriots included many prominent men of the [[Planter (American South)|planter class]] from Virginia and South Carolina, for instance, who became leaders during the Revolution, and formed the new government at the national and state levels.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}

To understand the opposing groups, historians have assessed evidence of their hearts and minds. In the mid-20th century, historian [[Leonard Woods Labaree]] identified eight characteristics of the Loyalists that made them essentially conservative; opposite traits to those characteristic of the Patriots.<ref name="Labaree, 1948 pp. 164–65">Labaree, ''Conservatism in Early American History'' (1948) pp. 164–65</ref> Older and better established men, Loyalists tended to resist innovation. They thought resistance to the Crown—which they insisted was the only legitimate government—was morally wrong, while the Patriots thought morality was on their side.<ref name="Hull 1978 pp. 344">Hull et al., ''Choosing Sides'' (1978) pp. 344–66</ref><ref name="Wallace, 1972 pp. 167">Burrows and Wallace, ''The American Revolution'' (1972) pp. 167–305</ref>

Loyalists were alienated when the Patriots resorted to violence, such as burning houses and [[tarring and feathering]]. Loyalists wanted to take a centrist position and resisted the Patriots' demand to declare their opposition to the Crown. Many Loyalists, especially merchants in the port cities, had maintained strong and long-standing relations with Britain (often with business and family links to other parts of the British Empire).<ref name="Hull 1978 pp. 344"/><ref name="Wallace, 1972 pp. 167"/>

Many Loyalists realized that independence was bound to come eventually, but they were fearful that revolution might lead to anarchy, tyranny or mob rule. In contrast, the prevailing attitude among Patriots, who made systematic efforts to use mob violence in a controlled manner, was a desire to seize the initiative.<ref name="Hull 1978 pp. 344"/><ref name="Wallace, 1972 pp. 167"/> Labaree also wrote that Loyalists were pessimists who lacked the confidence in the future displayed by the Patriots.<ref name="Labaree, 1948 pp. 164–65"/>

Historians in the early 20th century, such as [[J. Franklin Jameson]], examined the class composition of the Patriot cause, looking for evidence of a class war inside the revolution.<ref>J. Franklin Jameson, ''The American Revolution Considered as a Social Movement'' (1926); other historians pursuing the same line of thought included [[Charles A. Beard]], [[Carl L. Becker|Carl Becker]] and [[Arthur Schlesinger, Sr.]].</ref> In the last 50&nbsp;years, historians have largely abandoned that interpretation, emphasizing instead the high level of ideological unity.<ref>Wood, ''Rhetoric and Reality in the American Revolution'' (1966) pp. 3–32</ref> Just as there were rich and poor Loyalists, the Patriots were a 'mixed lot', with the richer and better educated more likely to become officers in the Army.<ref name="Nash 2005">Nash (2005)</ref><ref name="Resch 2006">Resch (2006)</ref>

Ideological demands always came first: the Patriots viewed independence as a means to gain freedom from British oppression and taxation and, above all, to reassert what they considered to be their rights as English subjects. Most yeomen farmers, craftsmen, and small merchants joined the Patriot cause to demand more political equality. They were especially successful in Pennsylvania but less so in New England, where John Adams attacked Thomas Paine's ''Common Sense'' for the "absurd democratical notions" it proposed.<ref name="Nash 2005"/><ref name="Resch 2006"/>

===King George III===
{{main|George III of Great Britain}}
The war became a personal issue for [[George III of the United Kingdom|the king]], fueled by his growing belief that British leniency would be taken as weakness by the Americans. The king also sincerely believed he was defending Britain's constitution against usurpers, rather than opposing patriots fighting for their natural rights.<ref>Andrew Jackson O'Shaughnessy, "'If Others Will Not Be Active, I must Drive': George III and the American Revolution." ''Early American Studies'' 2004 2(1): pp. 1–46. P. D. G. Thomas, "George III and the American Revolution." ''History'' 1985 70(228): 16–31, says the king played a minor role before 1775.</ref>

===Patriots===
{{Main|Patriot (American Revolution)}}
{{Further|Sons of Liberty}}
Those who fought for independence were called "Patriots", "Whigs", "Congress-men", or "Americans" during and after the war. They included a full range of social and economic classes but were unanimous regarding the need to defend the rights of Americans and uphold the principles of [[Republicanism in the United States|republicanism]] in terms of rejecting monarchy and aristocracy, while emphasizing civic virtue on the part of the citizens. Newspapers were strongholds of patriotism (although there were a few Loyalist papers) and printed many pamphlets, announcements, patriotic letters, and pronouncements.<ref>Carol Sue Humphrey, ''The American Revolution and the Press: The Promise of Independence'' (Northwestern University Press; 2013)</ref>

According to historian Robert Calhoon, 40–45% of the white population in the Thirteen Colonies supported the Patriots' cause, 15–20% supported the Loyalists, and the remainder were neutral or kept a low profile.<ref>Robert M. Calhoon, "Loyalism and neutrality" in {{cite book|author1=Jack P. Greene|author2=J. R.

He concludes that such people held a sense of rights which the British were violating, rights that stressed local autonomy, fair dealing, and government by consent. They were highly sensitive to the issue of tyranny, which they saw manifested in the British response to the Boston Tea Party. The arrival in Boston of the British Army heightened their sense of violated rights, leading to rage and demands for revenge. They had faith that God was on their side.<ref>Mark Edward Lender, review of ''American Insurgents, American Patriots: The Revolution of the People'' (2010) by T. H.

===Loyalists===
{{Main|Loyalist (American Revolution)}}
[[File:Mobbing the Tories - Project Gutenberg eText 16960.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|<center>Mobbing of a Loyalist by American Patriots in 1775–76</center>]]
The consensus of scholars is that about 15–20% of the white population remained loyal to the British Crown.<ref>Calhoon, "Loyalism and neutrality" in Greene and Pole, eds. ''A Companion to the American Revolution'' (1980) at [https://books.google.com/books?id=xK1NuzpAcH8C&pg=PA235 p. 235]</ref> Those who actively supported the king were known at the time as "Loyalists", "Tories", or "King's men". The Loyalists never controlled territory unless the British Army occupied it. They were typically older, less willing to break with old loyalties, and often connected to the Church of England; they included many established merchants with strong business connections throughout the Empire, as well as royal officials such as Thomas Hutchinson of Boston.<ref>Calhoon, "Loyalism and neutrality" in Greene and Pole, eds. ''A Companion to the American Revolution'' (1980) pp. 235–47,</ref> There were 500 to 1,000 [[Black Loyalist|black loyalists]], slaves who escaped to British lines and joined the British army. Most died of disease, but Britain took the survivors to Canada as free men.

The revolution could divide families, such as [[William Franklin]], son of Benjamin Franklin and royal governor of the [[Province of New Jersey]] who remained loyal to the Crown throughout the war. He and his father never spoke again.<ref>Sheila L. Skemp, ''Benjamin and William Franklin: Father and Son, Patriot and Loyalist'' (1994)</ref> Recent immigrants who had not been fully Americanized were also inclined to support the King, such as [[Flora MacDonald (Scottish Jacobite)|Flora MacDonald]] who was a Scottish settler in the back country.<ref>{{cite book|author=Joan Magee|title=Loyalist Mosaic: A Multi-Ethnic Heritage|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GsENbI3JIo0C&pg=PA137|year=1984|publisher=Dundurn|pages=137ff}}</ref>

After the war, the great majority of the approximately 500,000 Loyalists remained in America and resumed normal lives. Some became prominent American leaders, such as [[Samuel Seabury (1729–1796)|Samuel Seabury]]. Approximately 62,000 Loyalists relocated to Canada; others moved to Britain (7,000), Florida, or the West Indies (9,000). The exiles represented approximately two percent of the total population of the colonies.<ref name="Pole 1994">Greene and Pole (1994) chapters 20–22</ref> Nearly all black loyalists left for Nova Scotia, Florida, or England, where they could remain free.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.blackloyalist.com/canadiandigitalcollection/story/exile/chaos.htm |title=Chaos in New York |accessdate=2007-10-18 |work=Black Loyalists: Our People, Our History |publisher=Canada's Digital Collections |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071117073405/http://www.blackloyalist.com/canadiandigitalcollection/story/exile/chaos.htm |archivedate=2007-11-17 |df= }}</ref> Loyalists who left the South in 1783 took thousands of their slaves with them to be slaves in the British West Indies.<ref name="Pole 1994"/>

===Neutrals===
A minority of uncertain size tried to stay neutral in the war. Most kept a low profile, but the [[Religious Society of Friends|Quakers]] were the most important group to speak out for neutrality, especially in Pennsylvania. The Quakers continued to do business with the British even after the war began, and they were accused of being supporters of British rule, "contrivers and authors of seditious publications" critical of the revolutionary cause.<ref>Gottlieb (2005)</ref> The majority of Quakers attempted to remain neutral, although a sizable number of [[Quakers in the American Revolution]] nevertheless participated to some degree.

===Role of women===
[[File:Abigail Adams.jpg|right|thumb|alt=Abigail Adams|<center>[[Abigail Adams]]</center>]]
{{Main|Women in the American Revolution}}

Women contributed to the American Revolution in many ways, and were involved on both sides. While formal Revolutionary politics did not include women, ordinary domestic behaviors became charged with political significance as Patriot women confronted a war that permeated all aspects of political, civil, and domestic life. They participated by boycotting British goods, spying on the British, following armies as they marched, washing, cooking, and tending for soldiers, delivering secret messages, and in a few cases like [[Deborah Samson]], fighting disguised as men. Also, [[Mercy Otis Warren]] held meetings in her house and cleverly attacked Loyalists with her creative plays and histories.<ref>{{cite book|author=Eileen K. Cheng|title=The Plain and Noble Garb of Truth: Nationalism & Impartiality in American Historical Writing, 1784–1860|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9-dg5Zh8n4wC&pg=PA210|year=2008|publisher=University of Georgia Press|page=210}}</ref> Above all, they continued the agricultural work at home to feed their families and the armies. They maintained their families during their husbands' absences and sometimes after their deaths.<ref name="Berkin, 2006 pp. 59–60">Berkin, ''Revolutionary Mothers'' (2006) pp.&nbsp;59–60</ref>

American women were integral to the success of the boycott of British goods,<ref>Greene and Pole (1994) chapter 41</ref> as the boycotted items were largely household items such as tea and cloth. Women had to return to knitting goods, and to spinning and weaving their own cloth — skills that had fallen into disuse. In 1769, the women of Boston produced 40,000 skeins of yarn, and 180 women in [[Middleton, Massachusetts|Middletown, Massachusetts]] wove {{convert|20522|yd|m|0}} of cloth.<ref name="Berkin, 2006 pp. 59–60"/>

A crisis of political loyalties could disrupt the fabric of colonial America women's social worlds: whether a man did or did not renounce his allegiance to the King could dissolve ties of class, family, and friendship, isolating women from former connections. A woman's loyalty to her husband, once a private commitment, could become a political act, especially for women in America committed to men who remained loyal to the King. Legal divorce, usually rare, was granted to Patriot women whose husbands supported the King.<ref>Kerber, ''Women of the Republic'' (1997) chapters 4 and 6</ref><ref>Mary Beth Norton, ''Liberty's Daughters: The Revolutionary Experience of American Women'' (1980)</ref>

===France===
{{main|France in the American Revolutionary War}}
In early 1776, France set up a major program of aid to the Americans, and the Spanish secretly added funds. Each country spent one million "livres tournaises" to buy munitions. A [[dummy corporation]] run by [[Pierre Beaumarchais]] concealed their activities. American rebels obtained some munitions through the [[Dutch Republic]] as well as French and Spanish ports in the [[West Indies]].<ref>Jonathan Dull, ''A Diplomatic History of the American Revolution'' (1985) pp. 57–65</ref>

===Spain===
{{main|Spain in the American Revolutionary War}}
Spain did not officially recognize the U.S. but became an informal ally when it declared war on Britain on June 21, 1779. [[Bernardo de Gálvez y Madrid]], general of the Spanish forces in [[New Spain]], also served as governor of Louisiana. He led an expedition of colonial troops to force the British out of Florida and keep open a vital conduit for supplies.<ref>Thompson, Buchanan Parker, ''Spain: Forgotten Ally of the American Revolution'' North Quincy, Mass.: Christopher Publishing House, 1976.</ref>

===American Indians===
{{main|Native Americans in the United States}}
{{further|Western theater of the American Revolutionary War}}
Most American Indians rejected pleas that they remain neutral and instead supported the British Crown.  The great majority of the 200,000 Indians east of the Mississippi distrusted the Colonists and supported the British cause, hoping to forestall continued colonial encroachment on their territories.<ref>Greene and Pole (2004) chapters 19, 46 and 51; Colin G. Calloway, ''The American Revolution in Indian Country: Crisis and Diversity in Native American Communities'' (1995)</ref> Those tribes that were more closely involved in trade tended to side with the Patriots, although political factors were important, as well.

Most Indians did not participate directly in the war, except for warriors and bands associated with four of the [[Iroquois]] nations in New York and Pennsylvania which allied with the British. The British did have other allies, especially in the upper Midwest. They provided Indians with funding and weapons to attack American outposts. Some Indians tried to remain neutral, seeing little value in joining what they perceived to be a European conflict, and fearing reprisals from whichever side they opposed. The [[Oneida tribe|Oneida]] and [[Tuscarora people|Tuscarora]] among the Iroquois of central and western New York supported the American cause.<ref>Joseph T. Glatthaar and James Kirby Martin, ''Forgotten Allies: The Oneida Indians and the American Revolution'' (2007)</ref>

The British provided arms to Indians who were led by [[Loyalists]] in war parties to raid frontier settlements from the [[Province of Carolina|Carolinas]] to New York. They killed many settlers on the frontier, especially in Pennsylvania and New York's Mohawk Valley.<ref>Karim M. Tiro, "A 'Civil' War? Rethinking Iroquois Participation in the American Revolution." ''Explorations in Early American Culture'' 4 (2000): 148-165.</ref>

In 1776, [[Cherokee]] war parties attacked American Colonists all along the southern frontier of the uplands throughout the [[Washington District, North Carolina]] (now Tennessee) and the Kentucky wilderness area.<ref>Tom Hatley, ''The Dividing Paths: Cherokees and South Carolinians through the Era of Revolution'' (1993); James H. O'Donnell, III, ''Southern Indians in the American Revolution'' (1973)</ref> They would launch raids with roughly 200 warriors, as seen in the [[Cherokee–American wars]]; they could not mobilize enough forces to invade Colonial areas without the help of allies, most often the [[Muscogee (Creek)|Creek]]. The [[Chickamauga Cherokee]] under [[Dragging Canoe]] allied themselves closely with the British, and fought on for an additional decade after the signing of the Treaty of Paris.

[[Joseph Brant]] of the powerful [[Mohawk nation]], part of the Iroquois Confederacy based in New York, was the most prominent Indian leader against the Colonial forces. In 1778 and 1780, he led 300 Iroquois warriors and 100 white Loyalists in multiple attacks on small frontier settlements in New York and Pennsylvania, killing many settlers and destroying villages, crops, and stores.<ref>{{cite DCB |last=Graymont |first=Barbara |title=Thayendanegea (Joseph Brant) |url=http://www.biographi.ca/en/bio/thayendanegea_5E.html  |volume=5}}</ref> The Seneca, Onondaga, and Cayuga of the Iroquois Confederacy also allied with the British against the Americans.<ref name="Colin G. Calloway 1995">Colin G. Calloway, ''The American Revolution in Indian Country: Crisis and Diversity in Native American Communities'' (1995)</ref>

In 1779, the Colonists forced the hostile Indians out of upstate New York when Washington sent an army under [[John Sullivan (general)|John Sullivan]] which destroyed 40 empty Iroquois villages in central and western New York. The [[Battle of Newtown]] proved decisive as the Patriots had a 3-1 advantage and ended significant resistance. Otherwise there was little combat. Sullivan systematically burned the villages and destroyed about 160,000 bushels of corn that composed the winter food supply. Facing starvation and homeless for the winter, the Iroquois fled to Canada. The British resettled them in Ontario, providing land grants as compensation for some of their losses.<ref>Joseph R. Fischer, ''A Well-Executed Failure: The Sullivan Campaign against the Iroquois, July–September 1779'' (1997).</ref>

At the peace conference following the war, the British ceded lands which they did not really control, and did not consult their Indian allies. They transferred control to the United States of all the land east of the Mississippi and north of Florida. Calloway concludes:

{{quote|Burned villages and crops, murdered chiefs, divided councils and civil wars, migrations, towns and forts choked with refugees, economic disruption, breaking of ancient traditions, losses in battle and to disease and hunger, betrayal to their enemies, all made the American Revolution one of the darkest periods in American Indian history.<ref>Calloway (1995) p. 290</ref>}}

The British did not give up their forts in the West until 1796 in what is now the eastern Midwest, stretching from Ohio to Wisconsin; they kept alive the dream of forming a satellite Indian nation there, which they called a Neutral Indian Zone. That goal was one of the causes of the [[War of 1812]].<ref>{{cite journal | last=Smith| first=Dwight L.| year=1989| title=A North American Neutral Indian Zone: Persistence of a British Idea| journal=Northwest Ohio Quarterly| volume=61| issue=2–4| pages=46–63}}</ref><ref>Francis M.

{{main|African Americans in the Revolutionary War}}
Free blacks in the North and South fought on both sides of the Revolution, but [[Military history of African Americans#Revolutionary War|most fought for the Patriots]]. Gary Nash reports that there were about 9,000 black Patriots, counting the Continental Army and Navy, state militia units, privateers, wagoneers in the Army, servants to officers, and spies.<ref>Gary B.

Many black slaves sided with the Loyalists. Tens of thousands in the South used the turmoil of war to escape, and the southern plantation economies of South Carolina and Georgia especially were disrupted. During the Revolution, the British tried to turn slavery against the Americans.<ref name="Revolutionary War: The Home Front">[http://memory.loc.gov/learn/features/timeline/amrev/homefrnt/homefrnt.html Revolutionary War: The Home Front], Library of Congress</ref> Historian [[David Brion Davis]] explains the difficulties with a policy of wholesale arming of the slaves:

{{quote|But England greatly feared the effects of any such move on its own [[West Indies]], where Americans had already aroused alarm over a possible threat to incite slave [[insurrection]]s. The British elites also understood that an all-out attack on one form of property could easily lead to an assault on all boundaries of privilege and social order, as envisioned by radical religious sects in Britain's seventeenth-century civil wars.<ref>Davis p. 148</ref>}}

Davis underscored the British dilemma: "Britain, when confronted by the rebellious American colonists, hoped to exploit their fear of [[Slave rebellion|slave revolts]] while also reassuring the large number of slave-holding Loyalists and wealthy Caribbean planters and merchants that their slave property would be secure".<ref>Davis p. 149</ref> The Colonists, however, accused the British of encouraging slave revolts.<ref>Schama pp. 28–30, 78–90</ref>

American advocates of independence were commonly lampooned in Britain for what was termed their hypocritical calls for freedom, at the same time that many of their leaders were planters who held hundreds of slaves. [[Samuel Johnson]] snapped, "how is it we hear the loudest yelps for liberty among the [slave] drivers of the Negroes?"<ref>Stanley Weintraub, ''Iron Tears: America's Battle for Freedom, Britain's Quagmire, 1775–1783'' (2005) p. 7</ref> Benjamin Franklin countered by criticizing the British self-congratulation about "the freeing of one Negro" ([[Somersett's Case|Somersett]]) while they continued to permit the [[Slave Trade]].<ref>Schama, p. 75</ref>

[[Phyllis Wheatley]] was a black poet who popularized the image of [[Columbia (name)|Columbia]] to represent America. She came to public attention when her ''Poems on Various Subjects, Religious and Moral'' appeared in 1773.<ref name="Hochschild p.50-51">Hochschild pp.&nbsp;50–51</ref>

During the war, slaves escaped from New England and the mid-Atlantic area to British-occupied cities such as New York. The effects of the war were more dramatic in the South. In Virginia, royal governor Lord [[John Murray, 4th Earl of Dunmore|Dunmore]] recruited black men into the British forces with the promise of freedom, protection for their families, and land grants. Tens of thousands of slaves escaped to British lines throughout the South, causing dramatic losses to slaveholders and disrupting cultivation and harvesting of crops. For instance, [[South Carolina]] was estimated to have lost about 25,000 slaves to flight, migration, or death—amounting to one third of its slave population. From 1770 to 1790, the black proportion of the population (mostly slaves) in South Carolina dropped from 60.5 percent to 43.8 percent, and from 45.2 percent to 36.1 percent in [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]].<ref>Peter Kolchin, ''American Slavery: 1619–1877'', New York: Hill and Wang, 1993, p. 73</ref>

British forces gave transportation to 10,000 slaves when they evacuated [[Savannah, Georgia|Savannah]] and [[Charleston, South Carolina|Charleston]], carrying through on their promise.<ref>Kolchin, ''American Slavery'', p. 73</ref> They evacuated and resettled more than 3,000 [[Black Loyalist]]s from New York to [[Nova Scotia]], [[Upper Canada]], and [[Lower Canada]]. Others sailed with the British to England or were resettled as freedmen in the [[West Indies]] of the Caribbean. But slaves who were carried to the Caribbean under control of Loyalist masters generally remained slaves until British abolition in its colonies in 1834. More than 1,200 of the Black Loyalists of Nova Scotia later resettled in the British colony of [[History of Sierra Leone|Sierra Leone]], where they became leaders of the [[Sierra Leone Creole people|Krio]] ethnic group of Freetown and the later national government. Many of their descendants still live in Sierra Leone, as well as other African countries.<ref>Hill (2007), see also [http://www.blackloyalist.com/ blackloyalist.com]</ref>

==Effects of the Revolution==

===Loyalist expatriation===
Tens of thousands of Loyalists left the United States&nbsp;– the current high estimate is 70,000 by Maya Jasanoff.<ref>Maya Jasanoff, ''Liberty's Exiles: American Loyalists in the Revolutionary World'' (2011). However Philip Ranlet estimates that only 20,000 adult white Loyalists went to Canada. "How Many American Loyalists Left the United States?." ''Historian'' 76.2 (2014): 278–307.</ref>  Some migrated to Britain. The great majority, known as [[United Empire Loyalists]], received land and subsidies for resettlement in British colonies in North America, especially [[Province of Quebec (1763-1791)|Quebec]] (concentrating in the [[Eastern Townships]]), [[Prince Edward Island]], and [[Nova Scotia]].<ref>W. Stewart Wallace, ''The United Empire Loyalists: A Chronicle of the Great Migration'' (Toronto, 1914) [http://infomotions.com/etexts/gutenberg/dirs/1/1/9/7/11977/11977.htm online edition] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120329042740/http://infomotions.com/etexts/gutenberg/dirs/1/1/9/7/11977/11977.htm |date=2012-03-29 }}</ref> The new colonies of Upper Canada (now [[Ontario]]) and [[New Brunswick]] were expressly created by Britain for their benefit, where the Crown awarded land to Loyalists as compensation for losses in the United States.

===Interpretations===
Interpretations vary concerning the effect of the Revolution. Contemporaries of the period referred to it as "the revolution",<ref>David McCullough, ''John Adams'' (2001)</ref><ref>One modern writer argues that the events were not revolutionary because, according to his opinion, the relationships and property rights of colonial society were not significantly transformed. He posits that a distant government was simply replaced with a local one. (Greene, ''The American Revolution'' (2000) pp. 93–102)</ref> although the war is sometimes known as the "American War of Independence" outside the United States, particularly in the United Kingdom.

Historians such as [[Bernard Bailyn]], [[Gordon S. Wood|Gordon Wood]], and [[Edmund Morgan (historian)|Edmund Morgan]] view the American Revolution as a unique and radical event that produced deep changes and had a profound effect on world affairs, such as an increasing belief in the principles of the Enlightenment. These were demonstrated by a leadership and government that espoused protection of natural rights, and a system of laws chosen by the people.<ref>Wood, ''The American Revolution: A History'' (2003)</ref> John Murrin, by contrast, argues that the definition of "the people" at that time was mostly restricted to free men who were able to pass a property-qualification.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Murrin|first1=John M.|last2=Johnson|first2=Paul E.|last3=McPherson|first3=James M.|last4=Fahs|first4=Alice|last5=Gerstle|first5=Gary|title=Liberty, Equality, Power: A History of the American People|date=2012|publisher=Wadsworth, Cengage Learning|isbn=978-0495904991|page=296|edition=6th|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FGSQOiy6uZUC&pg=PT337#v=onepage}}</ref><ref name="U.S. Voting Rights">{{cite web|url=http://www.infoplease.com/timelines/voting.html|title=U.S. Voting Rights|accessdate=2 July 2013}}</ref> This view argues that any significant gain of the revolution was irrelevant in the short term to women, black Americans and slaves, poor white men, youth, and American Indians.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.history.org/foundation/journal/spring07/elections.cfm|title=Voting in Early America|last=Crews|first=Ed|accessdate=2 July 2013}}</ref><ref>McCool, Daniel, Susan M. Olson, and Jennifer L. Robinson. ''Native Vote,'' Cambridge, England: Cambridge University Press, 2007.</ref>

Morgan has argued that, in terms of long-term impact on American society and values:
:The Revolution did revolutionize social relations. It did displace the deference, the patronage, the social divisions that had determined the way people viewed one another for centuries and still view one another in much of the world. It did give to ordinary people a pride and power, not to say an arrogance, that have continued to shock visitors from less favored lands. It may have left standing a host of inequalities that have troubled us ever since. But it generated the egalitarian view of human society that makes them troubling and makes our world so different from the one in which the revolutionists had grown up.<ref>{{cite book|author=Edmund S. Morgan|title=The Genuine Article: A Historian Looks at Early America|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-Ve9u9pBeB0C&pg=PA246|year=2005|publisher=W. W. Norton|page=246|isbn=978-0393347845}}</ref>

===Inspiring all colonies===
{{Further|Atlantic Revolutions}}
After the Revolution, genuinely democratic politics became possible in the former colonies.<ref>Gordon Wood, ''The Radicalism of the American Revolution'' (1992) pp. 278–79</ref> The rights of the people were incorporated into state constitutions. Concepts of liberty, individual rights, equality among men and hostility toward corruption became incorporated as core values of liberal republicanism. The greatest challenge to the old order in Europe was the challenge to inherited political power and the democratic idea that government rests on the [[consent of the governed]]. The example of the first successful revolution against a European empire, and the first successful establishment of a republican form of democratically elected government, provided a model for many other colonial peoples who realized that they too could break away and become self-governing nations with directly elected representative government.<ref>Palmer, (1959)</ref>

[[File:Benjamin Franklin by Jean-Baptiste Greuze.jpg|thumb|100px|1777 Jean-Baptiste Greuze portrait of [[Ben Franklin]]]]
The Dutch Republic, also at war with Britain, was the next country to sign a treaty with the United States, on October 8, 1782.<ref name="Hamilton, 1974 p. 28"/> On April 3, 1783, Ambassador Extraordinary [[Gustaf Philip Creutz]], representing King [[Gustav III of Sweden]], and Benjamin Franklin, signed a [[Treaty of Amity and Commerce (USA–Sweden)|Treaty of Amity and Commerce]] with the U.S.<ref name="Hamilton, 1974 p. 28"/>

The American Revolution was the first wave of the [[Atlantic Revolutions]]: the [[French Revolution]], the [[Haitian Revolution]], and the [[Latin American wars of independence]]. Aftershocks reached Ireland in the [[Irish Rebellion of 1798]], in the [[Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth]], and in the Netherlands.<ref>Greene and Pole (1994) ch. 53–55</ref><ref>Wim Klooster, ''Revolutions in the Atlantic World: A Comparative History'' (2009)</ref>

The Revolution had a strong, immediate influence in Great Britain, Ireland, the Netherlands, and France. Many British and Irish [[British Whig Party|Whigs]] spoke in favor of the American cause. In Ireland, there was a profound impact; the [[Protestant Ascendancy|Protestants who controlled Ireland]] were demanding more and more self-rule. Under the leadership of [[Henry Grattan]], the so-called "[[Irish Patriot Party#Grattan's Patriots|Patriots]]" forced the reversal of mercantilist prohibitions against trade with other British colonies. The King and his cabinet in London could not risk another rebellion on the American model, and made a series of concessions to the Patriot faction in Dublin. Armed Protestant volunteer units were set up to protect against an invasion from France. As in America, so too in Ireland the King no longer had a monopoly of lethal force.<ref>R. B. McDowell, ''Ireland in the Age of Imperialism and Revolution, 1760–1801'' (1979)</ref>

The Revolution, along with the [[Dutch Revolt]] (end of the 16th century) and the 17th century [[English Civil War]], was among the examples of overthrowing an old regime for many Europeans who later were active during the era of the French Revolution, such as the [[Gilbert du Motier, Marquis de Lafayette|Marquis de Lafayette]]. The American Declaration of Independence influenced the French [[Declaration of the Rights of Man and the Citizen]] of 1789.<ref>Palmer, (1959); Greene and Pole (1994) chapters 49–52</ref><ref>Center for History and New Media, ''Liberty, equality, fraternity'' (2010)</ref> The spirit of the Declaration of Independence led to laws ending slavery in all the Northern states and the Northwest Territory, with New Jersey the last in 1804. States such as New Jersey and New York adopted gradual emancipation, which kept some people as slaves for more than two decades longer.<ref>Greene and Pole pp. 409, 453–54</ref>

===Status of American women===
The democratic ideals of the Revolution inspired changes in the roles of women.<ref>Linda K. Kerber, et al. "Beyond Roles, Beyond Spheres: Thinking about Gender in the Early Republic," ''William and Mary Quarterly,'' (1989), 46#3 565–85 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1922356 in JSTOR]</ref>

The concept of [[republican motherhood]] was inspired by this period and reflects the importance of [[revolutionary republicanism|Republicanism as the dominant American ideology]]. It assumed that a successful republic rested upon the virtue of its citizens. Women were considered to have the essential role of instilling their children with values conducive to a healthy republic. During this period, the wife's relationship with her husband also became more liberal, as love and affection instead of obedience and subservience began to characterize the ideal marital relationship. In addition, many women contributed to the war effort through fundraising and running family businesses in the absence of husbands.

The traditional constraints gave way to more liberal conditions for women. Patriarchy faded as an ideal; young people had more freedom to choose their spouses and more often used birth control to regulate the size of their families. Society emphasized the role of mothers in child rearing, especially the patriotic goal of raising republican children rather than those locked into aristocratic value systems. There was more permissiveness in child-rearing. Patriot women married to Loyalists who left the state could get a divorce and obtain control of the ex-husband's property.<ref>Mary Beth Norton, ''Liberty's Daughters: The Revolutionary Experience of American Women, 1750–1800'' (3rd ed. 1996)</ref>
Whatever gains they had made, however, women still found themselves subordinated, legally and socially, to their husbands, disfranchised and usually with only the role of mother open to them. But, some women earned livelihoods as midwives and in other roles in the community, which were not originally recognized as significant by men.

[[Abigail Adams]] expressed to her husband, the president, the desire of women to have a place in the new republic: "I desire you would remember the Ladies, and be more generous and favourable to them than your ancestors. Do not put such unlimited power into the hands of the Husbands."<ref>{{cite book|author=Woody Holton|title=Abigail Adams|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ltgyHkFGF3EC&pg=PA172|year=2010|publisher=Simon and Schuster|page=172|isbn=978-1451607369}}</ref>

The Revolution sparked a discussion on the rights of woman and an environment favorable to women's participation in politics. Briefly the possibilities for women's rights were highly favorable, but a backlash led to a greater rigidity that excluded women from politics.<ref>[[Rosemarie Zagarri]], ''Revolutionary Backlash: Women and Politics in the Early American Republic'' (2007), p. 8</ref>

For more than thirty years, however, the 1776 [[New Jersey State Constitution]] gave the vote to "all inhabitants" who had a certain level of wealth, including unmarried women and blacks (not married women because they could not own property separately from their husbands), until in 1807, when that state legislature passed a bill interpreting the constitution to mean universal ''white male'' [[suffrage]], excluding paupers.<ref>Klinghoffer and Elkis ("The Petticoat Electors: W omen's Suffrage in New Jersey, 1776–1807", ''Journal of the Early Republic'' 12, no. 2 (1992): 159–93.)</ref>

===Status of African Americans===
In the first two decades after the American Revolution, state legislatures and individuals took actions to free numerous slaves, in part based on revolutionary ideals. Northern states passed new constitutions that contained language about equal rights or specifically abolished slavery; some states, such as New York and New Jersey, where slavery was more widespread, passed laws by the end of the 18th century to abolish slavery by a gradual method; in New York, the last slaves were freed in 1827.

While no southern state abolished slavery, for a period individual owners could free their slaves by personal decision, often providing for manumission in wills but sometimes filing deeds or court papers to free individuals. Numerous slaveholders who freed their slaves cited revolutionary ideals in their documents; others freed slaves as a reward for service. Records also suggest that some slaveholders were freeing their own [[mixed-race]] children, born into slavery to slave mothers.

The American Revolution has a central place in the American memory<ref>Michael Kammen, ''A Season of Youth: The American Revolution and the Historical Imagination'' (1978); Kammen, ''Mystic Chords of Memory: The Transformation of Tradition in American Culture'' (1991)</ref> as the story of the nation's founding. It is covered in the schools, memorialized by a [[Independence Day (United States)|national holiday]], and commemorated in innumerable monuments. George Washington's estate at [[Mount Vernon]] was one of the first national pilgrimages for tourists and attracted 10,000 visitors a year by the 1850s.<ref>Jean B. Lee, "Historical Memory, Sectional Strife, and the American Mecca: Mount Vernon, 1783–1853," ''Virginia Magazine of History and Biography'' (2001) 109#3 pp. 255–300 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/4249931 in JSTOR]</ref>

The Revolution became a matter of contention in the 1850s in the debates leading to the [[American Civil War]] (1861–65), as spokesmen of both the [[Northern United States]] and the [[Southern United States]] claimed that their region was the true custodian of the legacy of 1776.<ref>Jonathan B. Crider, "De Bow's Revolution: The Memory of the American Revolution in the Politics of the Sectional Crisis, 1850–1861," ''American Nineteenth Century History'' (2009) 10#3 pp. 317–32</ref>  The [[United States Bicentennial]] in 1976 came a year after the American withdrawal from the [[Vietnam War]], and speakers stressed the themes of renewal and rebirth based on a restoration of traditional values.<ref>David Ryan, "Re-enacting Independence through Nostalgia – The 1976 US Bicentennial after the Vietnam War," ''Forum for Inter-American Research'' (2012) 5#3 pp. 26–48.</ref>

Today, more than 100 [[:Category:American Revolutionary War sites|battlefields and historic sites of the American Revolution]] are protected and maintained by the government.  The [[National Park Service]] alone owns and maintains more than 50 battlefield parks and sites related to the Revolution.<ref>[https://www.nps.gov/revwar/contact/park_info.html National Park Service Revolutionary War Sites.] Accessed Jan. 4, 2018.</ref> The [[American Battlefield Trust]] preserves almost 700 acres of battlefield land in six states.<ref>[https://www.battlefields.org/preserve/saved-land] [[American Battlefield Trust]] "Saved Land" webpage.
