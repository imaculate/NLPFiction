'''Passy''' is an area of [[Paris]], [[France]], located in the [[16th arrondissement of Paris|16th arrondissement]], on the [[Right Bank]]. It is home to many of the city's wealthiest residents.

Passy was a [[commune in France|commune]] on the outskirts of Paris. In 1658, hot springs were discovered around which spa facilities were developed. This attracted Parisian society and English visitors, some of whom made the area, which combined attractive countryside with both modest houses and fine residences, their winter retreat. The population was 2,400 in 1836, 4,545 in 1841, but larger in summer. In 1861 the population was 11,431. Passy's population was 17,594 when it was absorbed into Paris along with several other communities in 1860.<ref>{{cite book|first=Michel |last=Carmona| title=Haussmann: His Life and Times, and the Making of Modern Paris|date=2002 | publisher= Ivan R.

==Benjamin Franklin in Passy==
Passy was the home of [[Benjamin Franklin]] during the nine years that he lived in France during the [[American Revolutionary War]]. For much of this time, he was a lodger in the home of Monsieur de Chaumont.

Franklin established a small [[printing press]] in his lodgings to print pamphlets and other material as part of his mandate to maintain French support for the revolution. He called it the Passy Press.<ref name="passy press">{{cite book | title=Franklin and His Press at Passy: An Account of the Books, Pamphlets, and Leaflets Printed There, Including the Long Lost 'Bagatelles' | publisher=The Grolier Club | author=Livingston, Luther | year=1914 | location=New York}}{{page needed|date=June 2016}}</ref> Among his printing projects, he produced [[Bagatelles and Satires|comics]] he called ''Bagatelles''<ref name="passy press" /> and passports. He developed a typeface known as "le Franklin". He also printed a 1782 treatise by [[Pierre-André Gargaz]] titled ''A Project of Universal and Perpetual Peace'', which laid out a vision for maintaining a permanent peace in [[Europe]]. It proposed a central governing council composed of representatives of all the nations of Europe to arbitrate international disputes.<ref>{{cite journal| jstor= 23546604  | journal = Early American Studies | title= The Printer and the 'Peasant': Benjamin Franklin and Pierre-André Gargaz, Two Philosophers in Search of Peace | first=Ellen R. | last= Cohn| volume = 8| issue= 1| date= Winter 2010|pages= 146–172}}</ref>

He also worked on his scientific projects at a laboratory he shared with others, which had been installed by [[Louis XV]] in the [[Château de la Muette]].

When Franklin returned to America, the new American Ambassador to France, [[Thomas Jefferson]], wrote: "When he left Passy, it seemed as if the village had lost its patriarch."<ref>{{cite book|last1=Srodes|first1=James|title=Franklin: The Essential Founding Father|date=2011|publisher=Regnery History|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LK3MReWSr9wC&pg=PT285&|accessdate=1 June 2016}}</ref>  To this day, a street in Passy bears the name Rue Benjamin Franklin.

==Artists of Passy==
The painting [[Albert Gleizes]] painting ''[[Passy, Bridges of Paris (Gleizes)|Les ponts de Paris (Passy), The Bridges of Paris (Passy)]]'', housed in the collection of the Museum Moderner Kunst ([[mumok]]), Vienna, refers to the spirit of solidarity among the newly formed "Artists of Passy", during a time when factions had begun to develop within [[Cubism]]. ''Les Artistes de Passy'' consisted of a diverse grouping of [[avant-garde]] artistes (painters, sculptors and poets), including several who previously held meetings in 1910 at the rue Visconti studio of [[Henri Le Fauconnier]]. Their first diner presided over by neo-symbolist [[Paul Fort]] was held at the house of [[Balzac]], rue Raynouard, in the presence of [[Guillaume Apollinaire]], [[Raymond Duchamp-Villon]], [[Marie Laurencin]], Henri Le Fauconnier, [[Fernand Léger]], [[André Mare]], [[Jean Metzinger]], [[Francis Picabia]], Henry Valensi, and [[Jacques Villon]].<ref>[http://www.larousse.fr/archives/grande-encyclopedie/page/3910 ''Cubisme, 1912", Archives, Grande Encyclopédie Larousse]</ref> Albert Gleizes chose Passy as the subject of this painting.

==Places in Passy==
There is now a ''rue Benjamin Franklin'' and a ''square de Yorktown'' near the [[Trocadéro]].

A lively street in the area is Rue de Passy, which goes from La Muette to the Place de Costa Rica just behind the Trocadéro.  It has boutiques and chain stores along its length.

The [[Passy Cemetery|Cimetière de Passy]], located at 2, rue du Commandant Schœlsing, is the burial place for many well-known persons including American silent film star [[Pearl White]], the painters [[Édouard Manet]] and [[Berthe Morisot]], and composer [[Claude Debussy]].

[[Honoré de Balzac]] lived and wrote in Passy, and his house is now a museum ([[Maison de Balzac]]).

The apartment in which [[Marlon Brando]] trysts with [[Maria Schneider (actress)|Maria Schneider]] in [[Bernardo Bertolucci]]'s 1972 film ''[[Last Tango in Paris]]'' was located in Passy.
