'''Benjamin Franklin Parkway''', commonly abbreviated to '''Ben Franklin Parkway''', is a scenic boulevard that runs through the cultural heart of [[Philadelphia]], [[Pennsylvania]]. Named for Founding Father [[Benjamin Franklin]], the mile-long Parkway cuts diagonally across the [[grid plan]] pattern of Center City's Northwest quadrant. It starts at [[Philadelphia City Hall]], curves around [[Logan Circle (Philadelphia)|Logan Circle]], and ends before the [[Philadelphia Museum of Art]].

==Attractions==
The Parkway is the spine of Philadelphia's [[Museum District, Philadelphia|Museum District]]. Some of the city's most famous sights are here: [[Cathedral Basilica of Saints Peter and Paul (Philadelphia)|Cathedral Basilica of Saints Peter and Paul]]; [[Swann Memorial Fountain]]; [[Parkway Central Library]], the [[Family Court Building]], the [[Franklin Institute]], [[Moore College of Art and Design]], the [[Academy of Natural Sciences]], the [[Rodin Museum]], [[Eakins Oval]], the [[Barnes Foundation]] and the [[Philadelphia Museum of Art]]. From its northern end, the Parkway provides access to [[Fairmount Park]] through Kelly Drive (formerly East River Drive), Martin Luther King Drive (formerly West River Drive), the [[Schuylkill River Trail]], and the [[Schuylkill Expressway]] ([[Interstate 76 (east)|I-76]]).

The Parkway also is an outdoor sculpture garden. Works include: ''The Thinker'' by [[Auguste Rodin]]; ''Gates of Hell'' also by Rodin; ''LOVE'' by [[Robert Indiana]]; ''The Ideal Scout'' by [[Robert Tait McKenzie]]; ''Three-Way Piece'' by [[Henry Moore]]; the three River figures in the [[Swann Memorial Fountain]] by [[Alexander Stirling Calder]]; ''Shakespeare Memorial'' also by Calder; The ''Monument to Six Million Jewish Martyrs'' by [[Nathan Rapoport]] at the [[Horwitz-Wasserman Holocaust Memorial Plaza]]; ''Joseph Leidy'' by [[Samuel Murray]]; ''[[Aero Memorial (Manship)|Aero Memorial]]'' by [[Paul Manship]]; ''General Galusha Pennypacker'' by [[Charles Grafly]] and [[Albert Laessle]]; ''Jesus Breaking Bread'' by [[Walter Erlebacher]], ''All Wars Colored Soldiers and Sailors Memorial'' by [[J. Otto Schweizer]]; ''Thaddeus Kosciuszko'' by [[Robert Ingersoll Aitken|Robert Aitken]]; ''Civil War Soldiers and Sailors Memorial'' by [[Hermon Atkins MacNeil]]; ''Kopernik'' by [[Dudley Talcott|Dudley Vaill Talcott]]; ''Joan of Arc'' by [[Emmanuel Fremiet]]; [[Washington Monument (Philadelphia)|Washington Monument]] by [[Rudolf Siemering]]; and the ''Rocky'' statue by [[A. Thomas Schomberg]].

==Urban renewal==
[[File:Philadelphia museum district.JPG|thumb|left|Benjamin Franklin Parkway, with [[Franklin Institute]] in the foreground.]]

In a city [[list of Philadelphia neighborhoods|famous for its urban planning]], the Parkway represents one of the earliest examples of urban renewal in the [[United States]]. The road was constructed to ease heavy industrial congestion in [[Center City, Philadelphia|Center City]] and to restore Philadelphia's natural and artistic beauty, as part of the [[City Beautiful]] movement.

Preliminary proposals for the Parkway had been produced and added to the City Plan by 1906, but the first comprehensive plan for the Parkway was commissioned in 1907 by the Fairmount Park Art Association (now the [[Association for Public Art]]). The Association commissioned architects [[Horace Trumbauer]], Clarence Zantzinger, and [[Paul Philippe Cret]], who created a detailed parkway design that was formally added to the City Plan in 1909. Construction on the Parkway did not begin until 1917, when French landscape architect [[Jacques Gréber]] submitted a revised plan to the Commissioners of Fairmount Park. <ref>{{cite book|last=Brownlee|first=David Bruce |title=Building the city beautiful: the Benjamin Franklin Parkway and the Philadelphia Museum of Art|publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press| location = Philadelphia, PA | year = 1989 | isbn = 0812282213|}}</ref>

Gréber designed the Parkway in 1917 to emulate the [[Champs-Élysées]] in [[Paris]], [[France]]. The route was determined by an axis drawn from [[Philadelphia City Hall|City Hall Tower]] to a fixed point on the hill that [[William Penn]] called [[Fairmount Water Works|"Fairmount"]], now the site of the [[Philadelphia Museum of Art]].<ref>[http://www.phila.gov/phils/NationalHistoryDayPhilly/OneHistoryDay_2007.htm Outline History of the Benjamin Franklin Parkway 1871-1935.]</ref> The Champs-Élysées terminates at the [[Arc de Triomphe]], and the Parkway's terminating at the Art Museum gives the notion of "a slice of Paris in Philadelphia." The Parkway also has an international flavor by being lined with flags of countries from around the world. 

The traffic [[Roundabout|rotary]] on the western end of the Parkway, at the foot of the Art Museum's [[Rocky Steps]], is named [[Eakins Oval]] after Philadelphia painter [[Thomas Eakins]]. The traffic lanes around Eakins Oval originally formed a regular oval; this pattern was modified in the early 1960s to its present elongated circular shape, with the truncated lanes serving as staging areas for various events.

Because of its central location, the Parkway is the site for many concerts and parades. On July 2, 2005, the steps of the museum played host to the Philadelphia venue of [[Live 8]], where artists such as [[Dave Matthews Band]], [[Linkin Park]] and [[Maroon 5]] performed. The Parkway was also the site of Jay-Z's [[Budweiser Made in America Festival|Made in America Festival]] on September 1-2, 2012 featuring [[Jay-Z]], [[Pearl Jam]], [[Skrillex]] and [[Calvin Harris]], among others.  On September 26th and 27th, 2015, Pope Francis visited Philadelphia and the Parkway was flooded with over a million visitors both weekend days, a Celebration of Families on Saturday, and a Holy Mass on Sunday.

In recent years, there has been concern that the original plan of a wide, multi-sectioned, multi-laned, tree-lined boulevard, while beautiful to travel on, is not very engaging for pedestrian or other public use. Traffic along the Parkway has decreased considerably because of the completion of [[Interstate 676]] (Vine Street Expressway), linking the Schuylkill Expressway with the [[Benjamin Franklin Bridge]]. In response, the roadway has been narrowed somewhat and the sidewalks expanded around [[Logan Circle (Philadelphia)|Logan Circle]]. Various plans for the rest of the Parkway, some of which would insert shops and other smaller structures into the long stretches between museums, have been proposed, but none so far have been thought feasible or financially sound.

A new museum for the [[Barnes Foundation]] collection of [[Impressionist]] art on the site between the [[Free Library of Philadelphia|Free Library]] and the [[Rodin Museum]] opened in Spring 2012.
