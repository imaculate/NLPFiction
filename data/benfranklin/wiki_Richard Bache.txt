'''Richard Bache''' (September 12, 1737 – April 17, 1811), born in [[Settle, North Yorkshire|Settle]], [[Yorkshire]], [[England]], immigrated to [[Philadelphia]], in the colony of [[Pennsylvania]], where he was a businessman, a [[marine insurance]] underwriter, and later served as head of the American Post Office. He also was the son-in-law of [[Benjamin Franklin]].

==Career==
Bache immigrated as a young man in 1760 to New York to join his brother Theophylact in a dry goods and marine insurance business.  After a couple of years, he went to Philadelphia, where he prospered for several years. He was among nearly 30 young men who in October 1766 met at the city's [[London Coffee House]] to found the Gloucester Fox Hunting Club (GFHC), the first in America, to take up a pursuit closely associated with becoming "true Englishmen."<ref name="Skala">[https://books.google.com/books?id=YFF8ynVL4wIC&pg=PA52 Doreen Skala, "Fox Hunting and Anglicization in Eighteenth-Century Philadelphia"], in ''Locating the English Diaspora, 1500–2010'', edited by Tanja Bueltmann, Liverpool University Press, 2012, pp. 61–62, accessed 5 November 2012</ref> 
 
In 1767, Bache suffered financial problems when debts contracted by him were repudiated by his London associate, Edward Green.

==Marriage and family==

That year, Bache had proposed to [[Sarah Franklin Bache|Sarah Franklin]] (1743–1808), known as Sally, the only daughter of [[Benjamin Franklin]] and [[Deborah Read]]. They objected, given his precarious finances and rumors that Bache was a fortune hunter.<ref name="Herbert"/> Although Franklin and his wife Deborah Read never formally approved, they acquiesced to the marriage in 1767.<ref name="Herbert"/> Bache and Sally had eight children together, including [[Benjamin Franklin Bache (journalist)|Benjamin Franklin]], [[Louis Franklin Bache|Louis Franklin]] and [[Richard Bache Jr.|Richard Franklin]].

==Later years==
During the [[American Revolution]], Bache served on the [[Board of War]]. His wife, [[Sarah Franklin Bache|Sally Bache]] (1743–1808), was widely known for her patriotism and charitable activities.

Franklin later arranged an appointment for Bache as the US Postmaster General (1776–1782), to succeed him. After Franklin's death in 1790, Bache and Sally lived off her inheritance from Franklin, moving their family to the Vandegrift residence<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.livingplaces.com/PA/Bucks_County/Bensalem_Township/Eddington_Park.html|title=Eddington, Bensalem Township, Bucks County PA|website=www.livingplaces.com|language=en|access-date=2017-06-21}}</ref> in 1794 along the [[Delaware River]] north of Philadelphia.<ref name="Herbert">{{Cite journal |first=Eugenia W. |last=Herbert |title=A Note on Richard Bache (1737–1811) |journal=Pennsylvania Magazine of History and Biography |year=1976 |volume=100 |issue=1 |pages=97–103 |issn=0031-4587 }}</ref>
