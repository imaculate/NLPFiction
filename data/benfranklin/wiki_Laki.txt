'''Laki''' or '''Lakagígar''' (''Craters of Laki'') is a [[Fissure vent|volcanic fissure]] in the south of [[Iceland]], not far from the volcanic fissure of [[Eldgjá]] and the small village of [[Kirkjubæjarklaustur]]. The fissure is properly referred to as Lakagígar, while Laki is a mountain that the fissure bisects. Lakagígar is part of a volcanic system centered on the volcano [[Grímsvötn]] and including the volcano [[Thordarhyrna]].<ref name="gvp">{{cite gvp

The system erupted violently over an eight-month period between June 1783 and February 1784 from the Laki fissure and the adjoining volcano Grímsvötn, pouring out an estimated 42 billion tons or {{convert|14|km3|cumi|1|abbr=on}} of [[basalt]] lava and clouds of poisonous [[hydrofluoric acid]] and [[sulfur dioxide]] compounds that contaminated the soil, leading to the death of over 50% of Iceland's livestock population, and the destruction of the vast majority of all crops. This led to a [[famine]] which then killed approximately 25% of the island's human population.<ref>Gunnar Karlsson (2000), ''Iceland's 1100 Years'', p. 181</ref> The lava flows also destroyed 20 villages.

The Laki eruption and its aftermath caused a drop in global temperatures, as 120 million tons of sulfur dioxide was spewed into the [[Northern Hemisphere]].  This caused crop failures in Europe and may have caused droughts in North Africa and India.

The eruption continued until 7 February 1784, but most of the lava was ejected in the first five months. Grímsvötn volcano, from which the Laki fissure extends, was also erupting at the time, from 1783 until 1785. The outpouring of gases, including an estimated 8&nbsp;million tons of [[hydrogen fluoride]] and an estimated 120&nbsp;million tons of [[sulfur dioxide]], gave rise to what has since become known as the "Laki haze" across Europe.<ref name="1783–1784 Laki

The parish priest and dean of [[Vestur-Skaftafellssýsla]], Jón Steingrímsson (1728–1791), grew famous because of the ''eldmessa'' ("fire sermon") that he delivered on 20 July 1783. The people of the small settlement of [[Kirkjubæjarklaustur]] were worshipping while the village was endangered by a lava stream, which ceased to flow not far from town, with the townsfolk still in church.

The meteorological impact of Laki continued, contributing significantly to several years of extreme weather in Europe. In France, the sequence of extreme weather events included a surplus harvest in 1785 that caused poverty for rural workers, as well as droughts, bad winters and summers. These events contributed significantly to an increase in poverty and famine that may have contributed to the [[French Revolution]] in 1789.<ref name="Wood58-57">Wood, C.A., 1992.

===Consequences in North America===
In North America, the winter of 1784 was the longest and one of the coldest on record.  It was the longest period of below-zero temperatures in [[New England]], with the largest accumulation of snow in [[New Jersey]], and the longest freezing over of [[Chesapeake Bay]], where [[Annapolis, Maryland]] is, then the capital of the United States; the weather delayed Congressmen in coming to Annapolis to vote for the [[Treaty of Paris (1783)|Treaty of Paris]], which formally ended the [[American Revolutionary War]].

===Contemporary reports===
[[File:Kirkjubaejarklaustur.jpg|thumb|[[Kirkjubaejarklaustur]], a village in South Iceland, was the home of Jón Steingrímsson  (1728 – 1791), who left contemporary accounts of the effects of the eruption, which was nearby. His reports are extensively quoted in the book ''Island on Fire''.<ref>Witze, Alexandra and Jeff Kanipe. Island on Fire: The Extraordinary Story of Laki, the Volcano That Turned Eighteenth-Century Europe Dark. Profile Books, 2014. {{ISBN|9781781250044}}.</ref>]]
[[Gilbert White]] recorded his perceptions of the event at [[Selborne]], [[Hampshire]], England:

:The summer of the year 1783 was an amazing and portentous one, and full of horrible phaenomena; for besides the alarming meteors and tremendous thunder-storms that affrighted and distressed the different counties of this kingdom, the peculiar haze, or smokey fog, that prevailed for many weeks in this island, and in every part of Europe, and even beyond its limits, was a most extraordinary appearance, unlike anything known within the memory of man. By my journal I find that I had noticed this strange occurrence from June 23 to July 20 inclusive, during which period the wind varied to every quarter without making any alteration in the air. The sun, at noon, looked as blank as a clouded moon, and shed a rust-coloured ferruginous light on the ground, and floors of rooms; but was particularly lurid and blood-coloured at rising and setting. All the time the heat was so intense that butchers' meat could hardly be eaten on the day after it was killed; and the flies swarmed so in the lanes and hedges that they rendered the horses half frantic, and riding irksome. The country people began to look, with a superstitious awe, at the red, louring aspect of the sun; [...]<ref>{{cite book| author = Gilbert White|author2=Edward Jesse | title = The natural history of Selborne: with observations on various parts of nature and the Naturalist's calendar| url = https://books.google.com/?id=7-YYAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA300| year = 1870| publisher = Bell & Daldy| page = 300 }}</ref>

[[Benjamin Franklin]] recorded his observations in America in a 1784 lecture:

:During several of the summer months of the year 1783, when the effect of the sun's rays to heat the earth in these northern regions should have been greater, there existed a constant fog over all Europe, and a great part of North America. This fog was of a permanent nature; it was dry, and the rays of the sun seemed to have little effect towards dissipating it, as they easily do a moist fog, arising from water. They were indeed rendered so faint in passing through it, that when collected in the focus of a burning glass they would scarce kindle brown paper. Of course, their summer effect in heating the Earth was exceedingly diminished. Hence the surface was early frozen. Hence the first snows remained on it unmelted, and received continual additions. Hence the air was more chilled, and the winds more severely cold. Hence perhaps the winter of 1783–4 was more severe than any that had happened for many years.

: The cause of this universal fog is not yet ascertained [...] or whether it was the vast quantity of smoke, long continuing, to issue during the summer from [[Hekla]] in Iceland, and that other volcano which arose out of the sea near that island, which smoke might be spread by various winds, over the northern part of the world, is yet uncertain.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Franklin|first1=Benjamin|title=Meteorological imaginations and conjectures|journal=Memoirs of the Literary and Philosophical Society of Manchester|date=1785|volume=2|pages=357–361|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=n1JJAAAAcAAJ&pg=PA357#v=onepage&q&f=false|series=1st series}} ; see especially pp. 359–360.</ref>

Note that, according to contemporary records, Hekla did not erupt in 1783; its previous eruption was in 1766. The Laki fissure eruption was {{convert|45|mi|km}} to the east and the Grímsvötn volcano was erupting about {{convert|75|mi|km}} north east.  Additionally [[Katla volcano|Katla]], only {{convert|31|mi|km}} south east, was still renowned after its spectacular eruption 28 years earlier in 1755.

[[Sir John Cullum, 6th Baronet|Sir John Cullum]] of [[Bury St Edmunds]], [[Suffolk]], England, recorded his observations on 23 June 1783 (the same date on which Gilbert White noted the onset of the unusual atmospheric phenomena), in a letter to [[Joseph Banks|Sir Joseph Banks]], then President of the [[Royal Society]]:

:... about six o'clock, that morning, I observed the air very much condensed in my chamber-window; and, upon getting up, was informed by a tenant that finding himself cold in bed, about three o'clock in the morning, he looked out at his window, and to his great surprise saw the ground covered with a white frost: and I was assured that two men at Barton, about {{convert|3|mi|km}} off, saw in some shallow tubs, ice of the thickness of a crown-piece.<ref name="PhilTranRSocLond15">{{cite book | title=The Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London — Abridged with notes and biographical illustrations — Volume 15 — from 1781 to 1785 | authors=Hutton, C., Shaw, G. and Pearson, R. (editors) | year=1809 | pages=604–605}}</ref>

Sir John goes on to describe the effect of this "frost" on trees and crops:

:The [[Awn (botany)|aristae]] of the [[barley]], which was coming into ear, became brown and withered at their extremities, as did the leaves of the oats; the rye had the appearance of being mildewed; so that the farmers were alarmed for those crops. The wheat was not much affected. The [[larch]], [[Weymouth pine]], and hardy [[Scotch fir]], had the tips of their leaves withered.<ref name="PhilTranRSocLond15"/>
