The '''Society for the Relief of Free Negroes Unlawfully Held in Bondage''' was the first [[Abolitionism in the United States|American abolition]] society.  It was founded April 14, 1775, in [[Philadelphia]], [[Pennsylvania]] and held four meetings.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/aia/part3/3p249.html |title=Founding of Pennsylvania Abolition Society |work=Africans in America |publisher=PBS}}</ref> Seventeen of the 24 men who attended initial meetings of the Society were [[Quakers]], that is, members of the Religious Society of Friends, a branch of Christianity [[History_of_the_Quakers#William_Penn_and_settlement_in_colonial_Pennsylvania|notable in the early history of Pennsylvania]].

It was reorganized in 1784<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.hsp.org/node/2579 |title=Abolition, Anti-Slavery, and The Underground Railroad |publisher=Historical Society of Pennsylvania}}</ref> as the ''Pennsylvania Society for Promoting the Abolition of Slavery and for the Relief of Free Negroes Unlawfully Held in Bondage'',<ref>{{cite web |url=http://abolition.nypl.org/images/abolition/3/138 |title=Constitution of the Pennsylvania Abolition Society |work=The Abolition of The Slave Trade |publisher=New York Public Library}}</ref> (better known as the '''Pennsylvania Abolition Society''') and was [[incorporation (business)|incorporated]] in 1789.

At some point after 1785, [[Benjamin Franklin]] was elected as the organization's president. The society asked him to bring the matter of slavery to the [[Philadelphia Convention|Constitutional Convention]] of 1787. He petitioned the U.S Congress in 1790 to ban slavery.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.archives.gov/legislative/features/franklin/ |title=Benjamin Franklin Petitions Congress |publisher=National Archives and Records Administration}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title=Petition from the Pennsylvania Society for the Abolition of Slavery|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060521035446/http://www.ushistory.org:80/documents/antislavery.htm|date=February 3, 1790|accessdate=May 21, 2006|last=Franklin|first=Benjamin}}</ref>

The Pennsylvania Abolition (or Abolitionist) Society, which had members and leaders of both races, became a model for anti-slavery organizations in other states during the [[wiktionary:antebellum|antebellum]] years. Prominent African-American members included [[Robert Purvis]].

In 1984 when the Society was revived, a Pennsylvania State Historical Marker was placed on Philadelphia's Front Street below Chestnut Street, at the site of its original offices.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://explorepahistory.com/hmarker.php?markerId=1-A-273 |title=Pennsylvania Abolition Society Historical Marker |publisher=Pennsylvania Abolition Historical Society Marker |accessdate=December 14, 2012 |archivedate=December 14, 2012 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6CtXjPNqL |deadurl=no}}</ref>

The Pennsylvania Abolition Society still exists, dedicated to the cause of combating racism. The oldest abolitionist organization in the United States, since the late twentieth century, it has worked to improve issues of criminal justice and the over-representation of African Americans in prison, reduction in harsh sentencing laws, and improving economic and environmental justice.
