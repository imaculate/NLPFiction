The term "'''British North America'''" refers to the former territories of the [[British Empire]] in [[North America]], not including the Caribbean. The term was first used informally in 1783, but it was uncommon before the [[Report on the Affairs of British North America]] (1839), called the Durham Report.{{citation needed|date=November 2018}} These territories today form modern-day [[Canada]] and the [[Pacific Northwest]] of the [[United States]].

[[English overseas possessions|English]] and later [[Kingdom of Scotland|Scottish]] colonization of North America began in the 16th century in [[Newfoundland (island)|Newfoundland]], then began further south at [[Roanoke Colony|Roanoke]] and [[Jamestown, Virginia]], and reached its peak when colonies had been established through much of the Americas.

==Political divisions==
{{see also|Territorial evolution of Canada}}
In 1775, on the eve of the [[American Revolution]], the British Empire included 20 territories in the Western Hemisphere northeast of [[New Spain]], and apart from the islands and claims of the [[British West Indies]]. These colonies were:
* [[the Floridas]] ([[British East Florida|East]] and [[British West Florida|West Florida]], administered separately)
* [[Newfoundland Colony|Newfoundland]]
* [[History of Nova Scotia#Eighteenth century|Nova Scotia]]
* [[Province of Quebec (1763–1791)|Quebec]]
* [[Rupert's Land]] (the fur-trading territory of the [[Hudson's Bay Company]])
* [[History of Prince Edward Island#British Colony|St. John's Island]]
* the [[Thirteen Colonies]] (each one administered separately)

Britain acquired Quebec from France, and East and West Florida from Spain, by the [[Treaty of Paris (1763)]], which ended the [[Seven Years' War]].  By the [[Treaty of Paris (1783)]] the United States acquired the part of Quebec south of the Great Lakes; at the same time Spain gained West Florida and regained East Florida.

Nova Scotia was split into modern-day [[Nova Scotia]] and [[New Brunswick]] in 1784. The part of Quebec retained after 1783 was split into the primarily French-speaking [[Lower Canada]] and the primarily English-speaking [[Upper Canada]] in 1791.

After the [[War of 1812]], the [[Treaty of 1818]] established the [[49th parallel north|49th parallel]] as the United States–British North America border from Rupert's Land west to the [[Rocky Mountains]]. Then in 1846, Britain and the U.S. split the [[Oregon Country]]. The U.S. was assigned lands  south of the 49th parallel, but Britain retained all of [[Vancouver Island]] (south of the 49th parallel).

After threats and squabbles over rich timber lands, the boundary with [[Maine]] was clarified by the [[Webster-Ashburton Treaty]] of 1842.

[[The Canadas]] were [[Union of Upper and Lower Canada|united]] into the [[Province of Canada]] in 1841.

On 1 July 1867, the [[Confederation of Canada]] was created by the [[British North America Act]]. The new [[Canada|Dominion of Canada]] joined the provinces of Canada, New Brunswick, and Nova Scotia. The former Province of Canada was split back into its two parts, with Canada East (Lower Canada) being renamed [[Quebec]], and Canada West (Upper Canada) renamed [[Ontario]]. 

In 1870, Rupert's Land was annexed to Canada as the [[Northwest Territories]] (NWT) and the new province of [[Manitoba]]. [[British Columbia]], the British colony on the west coast north of the 49th parallel, including all of [[Vancouver Island]], joined as Canada's sixth province in 1871, and Prince Edward Island joined as the seventh in 1873. The boundary of British Columbia with [[Washington Territory]] was settled by arbitration in 1872, and with [[Alaska]] by arbitration in 1903.

The [[Arctic Archipelago]] was ceded by Britain to Canada in 1880 and added to the Northwest Territories (NWT). Later on, large sections of the NWT were split off as new territories (the [[Yukon Territory]] in 1898 and [[Nunavut]] in 1999), or provinces ([[Alberta]] and [[Saskatchewan]], both in 1905), or were added to existing provinces (Manitoba, Ontario, and Quebec, in stages ending in 1912).

In 1907, the sole remaining British North American colony, [[Dominion of Newfoundland|Newfoundland]], was granted the status of a [[Dominion]], although starting in 1934 it returned to British administration under the [[Commission of Government]]. In 1949, the island of [[Newfoundland (island)|Newfoundland]], and its associated mainland territory of [[Labrador]], joined Canada as the [[Newfoundland and Labrador|tenth province]].

Canada became semi-independent beginning in 1867, and fully sovereign on foreign affairs beginning with the [[Statute of Westminster 1931]]. Canada gained the right to establish and accept foreign embassies, with the first one being in [[Washington, D.C.]].

Then the last vestiges of Canada's constitutional dependency upon Britain remained until Canadians from various provinces agreed on an internal procedure for amending the Canadian Constitution. This agreement was implemented when the British Parliament passed the [[Canada Act 1982]] at the request of [[Parliament of Canada]].<ref name=Maton98>[[#Terms of Union|Maton, 1998]], article</ref><ref name=Maton95/>

*[[Province of Canada]] {{emdash}} (previously [[Upper Canada]] and [[Lower Canada]])
*[[Colony of Newfoundland|Newfoundland]]
*[[Nova Scotia]]
*[[New Brunswick]]
*[[Prince Edward Island]]
*[[Rupert's Land]]
*[[British Arctic Territories]]
*[[Columbia District]]/[[Oregon Country]] (shared with the United States)<ref name=Maton98/><ref name=Maton95/>

==Administration==
Besides the local colonial governments in each colony, British North America was administered directly via London.

From 1783 through 1801, British North America was administered by the Home Office and by the [[Home Secretary]], then from 1801 to 1854 under the [[War Office]] and Secretary of State for War and Colonies. When the [[Colonial Office]] was reestablished it was under the responsibility of the [[Secretary of State for the Colonies|Colonial Secretary]].<ref name=Maton98/><ref name=Maton95/>
