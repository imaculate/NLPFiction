In [[modern physics]], the '''double-slit experiment''' is a demonstration that light and matter can display characteristics of both classically defined waves and particles; moreover, it displays the fundamentally probabilistic nature of [[quantum mechanics|quantum mechanical]] phenomena. The experiment was first performed with light by [[Thomas Young (scientist)|Thomas Young]] in 1801. In 1927, [[Davisson–Germer experiment|Davisson and Germer]] demonstrated that electrons show the same behavior, which was later extended to atoms and molecules.<ref name="medium.com" /><ref name="Eibenberger 2013 pp. 14696–14700" />

Thomas Young's experiment with light was part of [[classical physics]] well before quantum mechanics, and the concept of [[wave-particle duality]]. He believed it demonstrated that the [[wave theory of light]] was correct, and his experiment is sometimes referred to as [[Young's interference experiment|Young's experiment]]<ref>While there is no doubt that Young's demonstration of optical interference, using sunlight, pinholes and cards, played a vital part in the acceptance of the wave theory of light, there is some question as to whether he ever actually performed a double-slit interference experiment.

The experiment belongs to a general class of "double path" experiments, in which a wave is split into two separate waves that later combine into a single wave. Changes in the path lengths of both waves result in a [[phase shift]], creating an [[interference pattern]]. Another version is the [[Mach–Zehnder interferometer]], which splits the beam with a mirror.{{Quantum mechanics |cTopic=Experiments}} In the basic version of this experiment, a [[Coherence (physics)|coherent light source,]] such as a [[laser]] beam, illuminates a plate pierced by two parallel slits, and the light passing through the slits is observed on a screen behind the plate.<ref name="Lederman">{{cite book |last= Lederman |first= Leon M. |author2=Christopher T.

Other atomic-scale entities, such as [[electrons]], are found to exhibit the same behavior when fired towards a double slit.<ref name="Feynman" /> Additionally, the detection of individual discrete impacts is observed to be inherently probabilistic, which is inexplicable using [[classical mechanics]].<ref name="Feynman" />

The experiment can be done with entities much larger than electrons and photons, although it becomes more difficult as size increases. The largest entities for which the double-slit experiment has been performed were [[molecule]]s that each comprised 810 atoms (whose total mass was over 10,000 [[atomic mass units]]).<ref name="medium.com">"[https://medium.com/the-physics-arxiv-blog/462c39db8e7b Physicists Smash Record For Wave-Particle Duality]"</ref><ref name="Eibenberger 2013 pp. 14696–14700">{{cite journal |last= Eibenberger |first=Sandra |title= Matter-wave interference with particles selected from a molecular library with masses exceeding 10000 amu |journal= [[Physical Chemistry Chemical Physics]] |volume=15 |issue=35 |pages= 14696–14700 |year= 2013 |doi= 10.1039/C3CP51500A |arxiv= 1310.8343 |bibcode = 2013PCCP...1514696E |display-authors=etal |pmid= 23900710}}</ref>

The double-slit experiment (and its variations) has become a classic [[thought experiment]], for its clarity in expressing the central puzzles of quantum mechanics. Because it demonstrates the fundamental limitation of the ability of the observer to predict experimental results, [[Richard Feynman]] called it "a phenomenon which is impossible […] to explain in any [[classical mechanics|classical way]], and which has in it the heart of quantum mechanics.  In reality, it contains the only mystery [of quantum mechanics]."<ref name="Feynman" />

==Overview==
[[Image:Single slit and double slit2.jpg|right|350px|thumb|Same double-slit assembly (0.7 mm between slits); in top image, one slit is closed. In the single-slit image, a [[diffraction pattern]] (the faint spots on either side of the main band) forms due to the nonzero width of the slit. A diffraction pattern is also seen in the double-slit image, but at twice the intensity and with the addition of many smaller interference fringes.]]
If light consisted strictly of ordinary or [[Classical mechanics|classical]] particles, and these particles were fired in a straight line through a slit and allowed to strike a screen on the other side, we would expect to see a pattern corresponding to the size and shape of the slit. However, when this "single-slit experiment" is actually performed, the pattern on the screen is a [[diffraction pattern]] in which the light is spread out. The smaller the slit, the greater the angle of spread. The top portion of the image shows the central portion of the pattern formed when a red laser illuminates a slit and, if one looks carefully, two faint side bands. More bands can be seen with a more highly refined apparatus. [[Diffraction]] explains the pattern as being the result of the interference of light waves from the slit.

[[File:Double slit experiment.webm|frame|Simulation of a particle wave function: double slit experiment. The white blur represents the particle. The whiter the pixel, the greater the probability of finding a particle in that place if measured.]]

If one illuminates two parallel slits, the light from the two slits again interferes. Here the interference is a more pronounced pattern with a series of alternating light and dark bands. The width of the bands is a property of the frequency of the illuminating light.<ref>[[Charles Sanders Peirce]] first proposed the use of this effect as an artifact-independent reference standard for [[length]]

When [[Thomas Young (scientist)|Thomas Young]] (1773–1829) first demonstrated this phenomenon, it indicated that light consists of waves, as the distribution of brightness can be explained by the alternately additive and subtractive interference of [[wavefront]]s.<ref name="Feynman" /> Young's experiment, performed in the early 1800s, played a vital part in the acceptance of the wave theory of light, vanquishing the [[corpuscular theory of light]] proposed by [[Isaac Newton]], which had been the accepted model of light propagation in the 17th and 18th centuries. However, the later discovery of the [[photoelectric effect]] demonstrated that under different circumstances, light can behave as if it is composed of discrete particles. These seemingly contradictory discoveries made it necessary to go beyond classical physics and take the [[Quantum mechanics|quantum]] nature of light into account.

Feynman was fond of saying that all of quantum mechanics can be gleaned from carefully thinking through the implications of this single experiment.<ref name="Greene_1999">{{cite book |last =Greene |first= Brian |authorlink= Brian Greene |title= The Elegant Universe: Super Strings, Hidden Dimensions, and the Quest for the Ultimate Theory |publisher= W.W.

The [[Englert–Greenberger duality relation]] provides a detailed treatment of the mathematics of double-slit interference in the context of quantum mechanics.

A low-intensity double-slit experiment was first performed by [[Geoffrey Ingram Taylor|G. I.

In 2012, Stefano Frabboni and co-workers eventually performed the double-slit experiment with electrons and real slits, following the original scheme proposed by Feynman. They sent single electrons onto nanofabricated slits (about 100&nbsp;nm wide) and, by collecting the transmitted electrons with a single-electron detector, they could show the build-up of a double-slit interference pattern.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Frabboni|first=Stefano|last2=Gabrielli|first2=Alessandro|last3=Carlo Gazzadi|first3=Gian|last4=Giorgi|first4=Filippo|last5=Matteucci|first5=Giorgio|last6=Pozzi|first6=Giulio|last7=Cesari|first7=Nicola Semprini|last8=Villa|first8=Mauro|last9=Zoccoli|first9=Antonio|date=May 2012|title=The Young-Feynman two-slits experiment with single electrons: Build-up of the interference pattern and arrival-time distribution using a fast-readout pixel detector|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ultramic.2012.03.017|journal=Ultramicroscopy|volume=116|pages=73–76|doi=10.1016/j.ultramic.2012.03.017|issn=0304-3991}}</ref>

==Variations of the experiment==

===Interference of individual particles===
[[Image:Double-slit experiment results Tanamura 2.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Electron buildup over time]]

An important version of this experiment involves single particles (or waves—for consistency, they are called particles here). Sending particles through a double-slit apparatus one at a time results in single particles appearing on the screen, as expected. Remarkably, however, an interference pattern emerges when these particles are allowed to build up one by one (see the adjacent image). This demonstrates the [[wave–particle duality]], which states that all matter exhibits both wave and particle properties: the particle is measured as a single pulse at a single position, while the wave describes the [[Probability amplitude|probability]] of absorbing the particle at a specific place on the screen.<ref>{{cite book |title=The Fabric of the Cosmos: Space, Time, and the Texture of Reality |first1=Brian |last1=Greene |publisher= Random House LLC |year=2007 |isbn=978-0-307-42853-0 |page=90 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=DNd2K6mxLpIC}} [https://books.google.com/books?id=DNd2K6mxLpIC&pg=PA90 Extract of page 90]</ref> This phenomenon has been shown to occur with photons, electrons, atoms and even some molecules, including [[buckyball]]s.<ref>{{cite journal |last1= Donati |first1= O | last2= Missiroli |first2= G F |last3= Pozzi |first3= G |year= 1973 |title= An Experiment on Electron Interference |journal= American Journal of Physics |volume= 41 |issue = 5| pages = 639–644 |doi= 10.1119/1.1987321 |bibcode= 1973AmJPh..41..639D }}</ref><ref name="buckyballs" /><ref>[http://www.quantum.at/research/molecule-interferometry-foundations/wave-particle-duality-of-c60.html Wave Particle Duality of C60] {{webarchive |url= https://web.archive.org/web/20120331115055/http://www.quantum.at/research/molecule-interferometry-foundations/wave-particle-duality-of-c60.html |date= 31 March 2012 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last1= lNairz | first1= Olaf |last2= Brezger |first2 = Björn |last3= Arndt |first3= Markus |last4= Anton Zeilinger |first4= Abstract |year= 2001 | title= Diffraction of Complex Molecules by Structures Made of Light | url = http://prl.aps.org/abstract/PRL/v87/i16/e160401 |journal= Phys.

The probability of detection is the square of the amplitude of the wave and can be calculated with classical waves (see [[#Classical wave-optics formulation|below]]). The particles do not arrive at the screen in a predictable order, so knowing where all the previous particles appeared on the screen and in what order tells nothing about where a future particle will be detected.<ref>Brian Greene, ''The Elegant Universe'', p. 104, pp. 109–114</ref> If there is a cancellation of waves at some point, that does not mean that a particle disappears; it will appear somewhere else.

===Delayed choice and quantum eraser variations===

[[File:Wheeler telescopes set-up.svg|alt=Wheeler's Delayed Choice Experiment|thumb|A diagram of Wheeler's Delayed Choice Experiment, showing the principle of determining the path of the photon after it passes through the slit]]
[[Wheeler's delayed choice experiment]]s demonstrate that extracting "which path" information after a particle passes through the slits can seem to retroactively alter its previous behavior at the slits.

[[Quantum eraser]] experiments demonstrate that wave behavior can be restored by erasing or otherwise making permanently unavailable the "which path" information.

A simple do-it-at-home illustration of the quantum eraser phenomenon was given in an article in ''Scientific American''.<ref name="Hillmer2007">{{cite magazine|last=Hillmer|first=R.|year=2007|title=A do-it-yourself quantum eraser|url=https://www.scientificamerican.com/slideshow/a-do-it-yourself-quantum-eraser/|magazine=Scientific American|volume=296|issue=5|pages=90–95|doi=10.1038/scientificamerican0507-90|pmid=|author2=Kwiat, P.|accessdate=2016-01-11|bibcode = 2007SciAm.296e..90H }}</ref> If one sets polarizers before each slit with their axes orthogonal to each other, the interference pattern will be eliminated.

==Classical wave-optics formulation==
[[File:Doubleslit3Dspectrum.gif|thumb|Two-slit diffraction pattern by a plane wave]]
[[File:Double slit interference.png|thumb|Photo of the double-slit interference of sunlight.]]
[[Image:Doubleslit.svg|thumb|200px|right|Two slits are illuminated by a plane wave.]]

Much of the behaviour of light can be modelled using classical wave theory.  The [[Huygens–Fresnel principle]] is one such model; it states that each point on a wavefront generates a secondary wavelet, and that the disturbance at any subsequent point can be found by [[Superposition principle|summing]] the contributions of the individual wavelets at that point. This summation needs to take into account the [[Phase (waves)|phase]] as well as the [[amplitude]] of the individual wavelets.  It should be noted that only the [[Intensity (physics)|intensity]] of a light field can be measured—this is proportional to the square of the amplitude.

In the double-slit experiment, the two slits are illuminated by a single laser beam.  If the width of the slits is small enough (less than the wavelength of the laser light), the slits diffract the light into cylindrical waves. These two cylindrical wavefronts are superimposed, and the amplitude, and therefore the intensity, at any point in the combined wavefronts depends on both the magnitude and the phase of the two wavefronts. The difference in phase between the two waves is determined by the difference in the distance travelled by the two waves.

If the viewing distance is large compared with the separation of the slits (the [[far field]]), the phase difference can be found using the geometry shown in the figure below right.  The path difference between two waves travelling at an angle {{math|θ}} is given by:

:<math>d \sin \theta \approx d \theta</math>

Where d is the distance between the two slits. When the two waves are in phase, i.e. the path difference is equal to an integral number of wavelengths, the summed amplitude, and therefore the summed intensity is maximum, and when they are in anti-phase, i.e. the path difference is equal to half a wavelength, one and a half wavelengths, etc., then the two waves cancel and the summed intensity is zero.  This effect is known as [[Interference (optics)|interference]].  The interference fringe maxima occur at angles

:<math>~ d \theta_n = n \lambda,~ n=0,1,2,\ldots</math>

where λ is the [[wavelength]] of the light. The angular spacing of the fringes, {{math|θ<sub>''f''</sub>}}, is given by

:<math> \theta_f \approx \lambda / d </math>

The spacing of the fringes at a distance {{math|''z''}} from the slits is given by

:<math>~w=z \theta_f = z \lambda /d</math>

For example, if two slits are separated by 0.5&nbsp;mm ({{math|''d''}}), and are illuminated with a [[visible spectrum|0.6μm]] wavelength laser ({{math|λ}}), then at a distance of 1m ({{math|''z''}}), the spacing of the fringes will be 1.2&nbsp;mm.

If the width of the slits {{math|''b''}} is greater than the wavelength, the [[Fraunhofer diffraction]] equation gives the intensity of the diffracted light as:<ref>Jenkins FA and White HE, Fundamentals of Optics, 1967, McGraw Hill, New York</ref>

:<math>
\begin{align}
I(\theta)
&\propto  \cos^2 \left [{\frac {\pi d \sin \theta}{\lambda}}\right]~\mathrm{sinc}^2 \left [ \frac {\pi b \sin \theta}{\lambda} \right]
\end{align}
</math>

Where the [[sinc function]] is defined as sinc(''x'') = sin(''x'')/''x'' for ''x'' ≠ 0, and sinc(0) = 1.

This is illustrated in the figure above, where the first pattern is the diffraction pattern of a single slit, given by the {{math|sinc}} function in this equation, and the second figure shows the combined intensity of the light diffracted from the two slits, where the {{math|cos}} function represent the fine structure, and the coarser structure represents diffraction by the individual slits as described by the {{math|sinc}} function.

Similar calculations for the [[near and far field|near field]] can be done using the [[Fresnel diffraction]] equation. As the plane of observation gets closer to the plane in which the slits are located, the diffraction patterns associated with each slit decrease in size, so that the area in which interference occurs is reduced, and may vanish altogether when there is no overlap in the two diffracted patterns.<ref>Longhurst RS, Physical and Geometrical Optics, 1967, 2nd Edition, Longmans</ref>

==Interpretations of the experiment==
Like the [[Schrödinger's cat]] [[thought experiment]], the double-slit experiment is often used to highlight the differences and similarities between the various [[interpretations of quantum mechanics]].

===Copenhagen interpretation===
{{unreferenced section|date=February 2012}}
The [[Copenhagen interpretation]], put forth by some of the pioneers in the field of quantum mechanics, asserts that it is undesirable to posit anything that goes beyond the mathematical formulae and the kinds of physical apparatus and reactions that enable us to gain some knowledge of what goes on at the atomic scale. One of the mathematical constructs that enables experimenters to predict very accurately certain experimental results is sometimes called a probability wave. In its mathematical form it is analogous to the description of a physical wave, but its "crests" and "troughs" indicate levels of probability for the occurrence of certain phenomena (e.g., a spark of light at a certain point on a detector screen) that can be observed in the macro world of ordinary human experience.

The probability "wave" can be said to "pass through space" because the probability values that one can compute from its mathematical representation are dependent on time. One cannot speak of the location of any particle such as a photon between the time it is emitted and the time it is detected simply because in order to say that something is located somewhere at a certain time one has to detect it. The requirement for the eventual appearance of an interference pattern is that particles be emitted, and that there be a screen with at least two distinct paths for the particle to take from the emitter to the detection screen. Experiments observe nothing whatsoever between the time of emission of the particle and its arrival at the detection screen. If a ray tracing is next made as if a light wave (as understood in classical physics) is wide enough to take both paths, then that ray tracing will accurately predict the appearance of maxima and minima on the detector screen when many particles pass through the apparatus and gradually "paint" the expected interference pattern.

===Path-integral formulation===
[[Image:Wiener process 3d.png|thumb|200px|One of an infinite number of equally likely paths used in the Feynman path integral (see also: [[Wiener process]])]]

The Copenhagen interpretation is similar to the [[path integral formulation]] of quantum mechanics provided by Feynman.  The path integral formulation replaces the classical notion of a single, unique trajectory for a system, with a sum over all possible trajectories.  The trajectories are added together by using [[functional integration]].

Each path is considered equally likely, and thus contributes the same amount.  However, the [[phase (waves)|phase]] of this contribution at any given point along the path is determined by the [[action (physics)|action]] along the path:

::<math>A_{\text{path}}(x,y,z,t) = e^{i S(x,y,z,t)}</math>

All these contributions are then added together, and the [[magnitude (mathematics)|magnitude]] of the final result is [[Square (algebra)|squared]], to get the probability distribution for the position of a particle:

::<math>p(x,y,z,t) \propto \left\vert \int_{\text{all paths}} e^{i S(x,y,z,t)} \right\vert ^2 </math>

As is always the case when calculating [[probability]], the results must then be [[Normalizing constant|normalized]] by imposing:

::<math>\iiint_{\text{all space}}p(x,y,z,t)\,\mathrm{d}V = 1</math>

To summarize, the probability distribution of the outcome is the normalized square of the norm of the [[superposition principle|superposition]], over all paths from the point of origin to the final point, of [[wave]]s [[wave propagation|propagating]] [[Proportionality (mathematics)|proportionally]] to the action along each path.  The differences in the cumulative action along the different paths (and thus the relative phases of the contributions) produces the [[Interference (wave propagation)|interference pattern]] observed by the double-slit experiment.  Feynman stressed that his formulation is merely a mathematical description, not an attempt to describe a real process that we can measure.

===Relational interpretation===
[[File:Uncertainty Momentum 1.gif|alt=Uncertainty Momentum|thumb|An example of the uncertainty principle related to the relational interpretation. The more that is known about the position of a particle, the less is known about the velocity, and vice versa]]
According to the [[Relational quantum mechanics|relational interpretation of quantum mechanics]], first proposed by [[Carlo Rovelli]],<ref>{{Cite journal|doi = 10.1007/BF02302261|last = Rovelli|first = Carlo|authorlink = Carlo Rovelli|title = Relational Quantum Mechanics|journal = International Journal of Theoretical Physics|volume = 35|issue = 8|pages = 1637–1678|year = 1996|arxiv = quant-ph/9609002 |bibcode = 1996IJTP...35.1637R }}</ref> observations such as those in the double-slit experiment result specifically from the interaction between the [[Observer (quantum physics)|observer]] (measuring device) and the object being observed (physically interacted with), not any absolute property possessed by the object. In the case of an electron, if it is initially "observed" at a particular slit, then the observer–particle (photon–electron) interaction includes information about the electron's position. This partially constrains the particle's eventual location at the screen. If it is "observed" (measured with a photon) not at a particular slit but rather at the screen, then there is no "which path" information as part of the interaction, so the electron's "observed" position on the screen is determined strictly by its probability function. This makes the resulting pattern on the screen the same as if each individual electron had passed through both slits. It has also been suggested that space and distance themselves are relational, and that an electron can appear to be in "two places at once"—for example, at both slits—because its spatial relations to particular points on the screen remain identical from both slit locations.<ref>{{Cite journal|last = Filk|first = Thomas|title = Relational Interpretation of the Wave Function and a Possible Way Around Bell's Theorem|journal = International Journal of Theoretical Physics|volume = 45|issue = 6|pages = 1205–1219|year = 2006|url = http://www.springerlink.com/content/v775765467462313/|doi = 10.1007/s10773-006-9125-0|arxiv = quant-ph/0602060 |bibcode = 2006IJTP...45.1166F }}</ref>

===Many-worlds interpretation===
Physicist [[David Deutsch]] argues in his book ''[[The Fabric of Reality]]'' that the double-slit experiment is evidence for the [[many-worlds interpretation]]. However, since every interpretation of quantum mechanics is empirically indistinguishable, some scientists are skeptical of this claim.

===De Broglie–Bohm theory===
An alternative to the standard understanding of quantum mechanics, [[De Broglie–Bohm theory]] states that particles have precise locations at all times, and that their velocities are influenced by the wave-function. So while a single particle will travel through one particular slit in the double-slit experiment, the so-called "pilot wave" that influences it will travel through both. The two slit de Broglie-Bohm trajectories were first calculated by Chris Dewdney whilst working with Chris Philippidis and Basil Hiley at Birkbeck College (London).<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Philippidis|first=C.|last2=Dewdney|first2=C.|last3=Hiley|first3=B.
