"'''Fart Proudly'''" (also called "'''A Letter to a Royal Academy about farting'''", and "'''To the Royal Academy of Farting'''") is the popular name of an essay about [[flatulence]] written by [[Benjamin Franklin]] c. 1781 while he was living abroad as [[United States Ambassador to France]].<ref name=autogenerated1>{{cite book|editor1-last=Japiske|editor1-first=Carl|title=Fart Proudly: Writings of Benjamin Franklin You Never Read in School|date=2003|publisher=Frog Books|location=Berkeley, CA|isbn=9781583940792}}</ref><ref name=":0">{{Cite web|url=http://teachingamericanhistory.org/library/index.asp?document=470|title=The Royal Academy of Farting *****|last=Franklin|first=Benjamin|date=1781|website=teachingamericanhistory.org|publisher=|access-date=2016-09-26}}</ref>

==Description==
"A Letter to a Royal Academy" was composed in response to a call for [[Academic publishing|scientific papers]] from the [[The Royal Academies for Science and the Arts of Belgium|Royal Academy of Brussels]]. Franklin believed that the various academic societies in [[Europe]] were increasingly pretentious and concerned with the impractical. Revealing his "bawdy, scurrilous side,"<ref name=autogenerated1 /> Franklin responded with an essay suggesting that research and practical reasoning be undertaken into methods of improving the odor of human flatulence.<ref name=autogenerated1 />

The essay was never submitted but was sent as a letter to [[Richard Price]],<ref name=autogenerated1 /> a [[Wales|Welsh]] [[philosophy|philosopher]] and [[Unitarianism|Unitarian]] minister in [[England]] with whom Franklin had an ongoing correspondence. The text of the essay's introduction reads in part:

{{quote|I have perused your late [[mathematical]] Prize Question, proposed in lieu of one in [[Natural Philosophy]], for the ensuing year...Permit me then humbly to propose one of that sort for your consideration, and through you, if you approve it, for the serious Enquiry of learned [[Physicians]], Chemists, &c. of this [[Age of Enlightenment|enlightened Age]]. It is universally well known, that in digesting our common food, there is created or produced in the [[bowel]]s of human creatures, a great quantity of wind. That the permitting this air to escape and mix with the atmosphere, is usually offensive to the company, from the fetid smell that accompanies it. That all well-bred people therefore, to avoid giving such offence, forcibly restrain the efforts of nature to discharge that wind.}}

The essay goes on to discuss the way different foods affect the odor of flatulence and to propose [[Scientific method|scientific testing]] of farting. Franklin also suggests that scientists work to develop a drug, "wholesome and not disagreeable", which can be mixed with "common Food or Sauces" with the effect of rendering flatulence "not only inoffensive, but agreeable as Perfumes". The essay ends with a [[pun]] saying that compared to the practical applications of this discussion, other sciences are "scarcely worth a [[Farthing (British coin)|FART-HING]]."
 
Copies of the essay were privately printed by Franklin at his [[printing press]] in [[Passy]]. Franklin distributed the essay to friends, including [[Joseph Priestley]] (a [[chemistry|chemist]] famous for his work on [[gas]]es). After Franklin's death, the essay was long excluded from published collections of Franklin's writing, but it is available online.<ref name=":0" />
