'''William Temple Franklin''', known as '''Temple Franklin''', (22 February 1762 in [[London]] &ndash; 25 May 1823 in [[Paris]]) was an [[United States|American]] [[diplomat]] and [[real estate]] speculator. He is best known for his involvement with the American diplomatic mission in France during the [[American Revolutionary War]]. Beginning at the age of 16, he served as secretary to his grandfather [[Benjamin Franklin]], who negotiated and agreed to the [[Franco-American Alliance]].

The younger Franklin was also secretary for the American delegation that negotiated United States independence at the [[Treaty of Paris (1783)|Treaty of Paris]] in 1783. He returned to [[Philadelphia]] with his grandfather afterward. Finding his prospects limited in the United States, he later returned to Europe, where he lived mostly in France.

==Early life and education==
[[Image:WilliamFranklin.jpeg|thumb|right|200px|Temple's father [[William Franklin]] was [[Governor of New Jersey]] and a prominent [[Loyalist (American Revolution)|Loyalist]].]]
William Temple Franklin, called Temple, was born in 1760,<ref name="WTFpapers"/> the [[illegitimate]] (and only) son of [[William Franklin]], notably illegitimate as well, who sired him while a law student in Connecticut. His mother is unknown, and the infant was placed in foster care. His father William was the illegitimate but acknowledged son of [[Benjamin Franklin]], one of the [[Founding Fathers]] of the United States, and raised in his household. William Temple Franklin's middle name is said to have been derived from his having been conceived while his father was studying at the [[Middle Temple]].<ref>Stockdale, Eric and [[Randy J. Holland]]. ''Middle Temple Lawyers and the American Revolution.'' Thompson-West, 2007. p. 41.</ref>

Later in 1762, William married "respectably",<ref name="WTFpapers"/> to Elizabeth Downes in London, the daughter of a wealthy [[Barbados]] planter.<ref name="Schiff p. 377">Schiff p. 377</ref> After passing the bar, he returned to North America, but he continued to pay for the upkeep and later education of Temple.<ref name="WTFpapers"/>

In 1763, with the aid of his father Benjamin Franklin, William Franklin was appointed as the last [[List of colonial governors of New Jersey|colonial governor of]] [[New Jersey]] and went to North America. He left Temple in foster care. William's position as a Loyalist later put him at odds with his father, and they broke permanently over it. William Franklin was imprisoned during the Revolution and afterward forced into exile in Britain.

Benjamin Franklin learned of his grandson Temple (his only grandson through the male line) while on an extended mission in London, when the boy was about four. He became fond of the young boy, but at first did not tell him of his full identity.<ref name="WTFpapers"/> He eventually took over custody, returning with the youth to the United States in 1775, and acknowledging their blood relation. A widower by then, Franklin raised the boy in his household.<ref name="Life">[http://www.yale.edu/opa/arc-ybc/v28.n34/story3.html "Editor Claude-Anne Lopez describes her 'life with Benjamin Franklin'"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090418114856/http://www.yale.edu/opa/arc-ybc/v28.n34/story3.html |date=2009-04-18 }}, ''Yale Bulletin and Calendar,'' Vol. 28, No. 34, 23 June 2000, accessed 4 November 2012</ref>

Temple, as he was generally known, accompanied his grandfather Benjamin Franklin to France in late 1776. From the age of 16, he worked as secretary to the American diplomatic mission during the [[American Revolution]]. Benjamin hoped the trip would round out Temple's education.<ref>Schaeper p. 92</ref> Along with his cousin [[Benjamin Franklin Bache (journalist)|Benjamin Franklin Bache]], Temple was educated further in [[France]] and [[Switzerland]].

A ''bon vivant'', Temple received his highest public appointment as Secretary to the American delegation at the [[Treaty of Paris (1783)|Treaty of Paris]] in 1782 &ndash; 1783, largely through the influence of his grandfather. He never again attained a significant political post in the United States. Benjamin Franklin unsuccessfully lobbied [[Second Continental Congress|Congress]] in the hope that Temple would be given a diplomatic post; he believed that, in time, his grandson would succeed him as Ambassador to France.<ref>Schiff pp. 332-335</ref> His appeal was rejected for a variety of reasons, including political opposition to Benjamin Franklin and suspicions about Temple's relations with his [[Loyalist (American Revolution)|Loyalist]] father, who by then was in exile in London. [[Thomas Jefferson]] commiserated with Temple over his failure to secure a post, but wrote a letter to [[James Monroe]] raising questions about the young man's temperament and abilities.<ref>Schiff pp. 389-390</ref>

During the negotiations for the [[Treaty of Paris (1783)|Treaty of Paris]], Temple asked one of the British peace commissioners if something could be done for his father. He noted his father's steadfast defense of the [[Stamp Act]], and hoped that the British government might award him a diplomatic post.<ref>Schiff p. 334</ref> During 1784, Temple went to [[London]] and reconciled with his father, lengthening his stay several times before returning to Paris at the end of the year.<ref>Schiff pp. 375-477</ref> In January 1785, Temple received the first [[airmail]] in history when a letter from his father was brought across the [[English Channel]] by a [[hot air balloon]] flown by [[Jean-Pierre Blanchard]] and [[John Jeffries]].<ref name="Schiff p. 377"/>

==Later life==
When Benjamin Franklin relinquished his post and sailed home to the United States in 1785, Temple accompanied him. Franklin sent the younger man to see government officials in Philadelphia, to try to recover expenses owed for his time in Paris, but his request was not granted. With his hopes of a diplomatic career at an end, Benjamin Franklin advised Temple to try to develop as a major landowner, since many areas of the country were being settled in rapid postwar development. By this stage Temple was disillusioned. He said that the United States was driven by [[Political faction|faction]]s and, if a foreign power were to attempt to conquer the country, they would certainly be successful.<ref>Schiff p. 390</ref>

After the elder Franklin died in 1790, Temple lived for a while with his father William in [[England]]. In London, he acted as an agent of the American [[Robert Morris (merchant)|Robert Morris]] of Philadelphia, a signer of the [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]], a financier of the [[American Revolution]], and the wealthiest man in the United States. (See [[Holland Land Company]], [[The Holland Purchase]], and [[The Morris Reserve]].) In 1792, Franklin sold {{convert|12000000|acre|km2 sqmi}} of the Phelps and Gorham Purchase east of the Genesee River in [[New York (state)|New York]] state to [[The Pulteney Association]], made up of three British investors. There was widespread land speculation in New York after the Revolution, as most of the [[Iroquois]] nations, as allies of the British, had been forced to cede their lands to the United States by the postwar treaty. Millions of acres became available for sale to investors, speculators and settlers.

The [[Franklinville (town), New York|town]] and [[Franklinville (village), New York|village of Franklinville]], in [[Cattaraugus County, New York|Cattaraugus County]] (one of the counties formed from land in the Holland Purchase), is presumably named after William Temple Franklin.

==Marriage and family==
During his first period in France, Temple had an illegitimate son, Théodore, with his mistress, Blanchette Caillot, a married woman.<ref name="WTFpapers"/> The boy died before reaching age five.<ref name="WTFpapers"/>

After his return to England and living with his father, Temple Franklin followed his grandfather and father's footsteps and had an illegitimate daughter, Ellen (May 15, 1798 [[London]] – 1875 [[Nice]], [[France]]), with Ellen Johnson D'Evelin the sister-in-law of his father's second wife Mary (who had been a widow with children).<ref>Daniel Mark Epstein (2017), ''The Loyal Son: The War in Ben Franklin's House''</ref> William Franklin took responsibility for his granddaughter Ellen. Temple moved to Paris, where he lived the remainder of his life and never saw his father again.<ref>Sheila L. Skemp (1990) ''William Franklin: Son of a Patriot, Servant of a King'', pp 274</ref> Temple's daughter Ellen eventually was married to Capel Hanbury and had a daughter named Maria Hanbury, who was unmarried and had no children.

When he was living in France again, Temple had a long relationship with Hannah Collyer (1771-1846), an Englishwoman. They finally married a month before his 1823 death, in poverty, in Paris.<ref name="WTFpapers"/> Temple is buried at [[Père Lachaise Cemetery]]. Hannah died on 12 December 1846, at age 75, and is buried next to Temple.<ref>[https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/40047536  William Temple Franklin (1762-1823) - Find A Grave Memorial] Retrieved 18 January 2018</ref>

==Years in France==
[[File:Père-Lachaise - Division 43 - Franklin 01.jpg|thumb|[[Père Lachaise Cemetery]]]]
After his move to France, Franklin continued to act as a real-estate speculator, gaining and losing a fortune.

By his will of 1788, Benjamin Franklin had bequeathed Temple his papers and correspondence, and appointed him as his literary heir. Temple edited and published editions of Franklin's writings, including his well-known ''[[The Autobiography of Benjamin Franklin|Autobiography]],'' published in London and Philadelphia, 1816 – 1819. He published six volumes of papers from 1817 – 1819.<ref name="BFpapers">[http://www.amphilsoc.org/mole/view?docId=ead/Mss.B.F85-ead.xml "Benjamin Franklin Papers, 1730-1791"], American Philosophical Society, accessed 4 November 2012</ref> Temple Franklin's collected papers are held by the [[American Philosophical Society]] in Philadelphia.<ref>[http://www.amphilsoc.org/library/mole/f/franklin/wtf.htm Profile and Collected Papers of William Temple Franklin] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090507094002/http://www.amphilsoc.org/library/mole/f/franklin/wtf.htm |date=May 7, 2009 }}, American Philosophical Society, accessed 4 November 2012</ref>
