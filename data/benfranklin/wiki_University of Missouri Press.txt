Voegelin spent much of his career at Louisiana State University, the University of Munich, and the Hoover Institution at Stanford University.

During his lifetime he published many books and more than one hundred articles. The Collected Works of Eric Voegelin makes available in a uniform edition all of Voegelin's major writings. In thirty-four volumes the Collected Works includes the monumental, never-before-published History of Political Ideas; important published essays not previously collected in book form or published only in German; previously unpublished essays; selected correspondence; translations of seven books, four of them never before available in English; and the five-volume Order and History.
