'''Sarah "Sally" Franklin Bache''' (September 11, 1743 – October 5, 1808) was the daughter of [[Benjamin Franklin]] and [[Deborah Read]]. She was a leader in relief work during the [[American Revolutionary War]] and frequently served as her father's political hostess, as her mother had done before her death in 1774.

==Early life and education==
Born Sarah Franklin and known as "Sally" throughout her life, she was the only surviving child of her parents, [[Deborah Read]] and [[Benjamin Franklin]]. Their son Francis Franklin died of smallpox at age four. Also in their household was her older half-brother [[William Franklin]], her father's illegitimate son whom her parents raised from infancy. She was carefully educated by her father about political life.

==Marriage and family==
Sarah married [[Richard Bache]] on October 29, 1767, although her family was worried about his financial position. The couple had eight children together:<ref>[http://www.ushistory.org/franklin/biography/app01.htm ''The Autobiography of Benjamin Franklin'', by Benjamin Franklin, Appendix 1]</ref>

==Revolutionary War years==
Sarah Bache was an ardent Patriot during the [[American Revolutionary War]]. She did extensive relief work. After her father's return in 1775 from a diplomatic mission to France, she frequently acted as his political hostess, as her mother had died in 1774.

She raised money for the [[Continental Army]] and is known for her involvement in the Ladies Association of [[Philadelphia]]. In 1780, under her leadership, the group made 2,200 shirts for the soldiers in the Continental Army at the army's winter quarters at [[Valley Forge]]. The women often met to work together at [[The Cliffs]], a country estate owned by [[Samuel Rowland Fisher|Samuel R. Fisher]] on the [[Schuylkill River]], two miles north of [[Philadelphia]].

==Personal life==
Bache loved music and reading, and was considered a skilled harpsichordist. When her father died in 1790, he left most of his estate to her. Among the items bequeathed to her was a small portrait of [[Louis XVI]] surrounded by diamonds, which she sold to finance a trip to London. In 1794, she and her family moved to a farm outside Philadelphia, to the north along the [[Delaware River]].

Sarah Franklin Bache died in 1808 and is buried in [[Christ Church Burial Ground]], Philadelphia.
