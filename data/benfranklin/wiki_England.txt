England's terrain is chiefly low hills and [[plain]]s, especially in central and southern England. However, there is upland and mountainous terrain in the north (for example, the [[Lake District]] and [[Pennines]]) and in the west (for example, [[Dartmoor]] and the [[Shropshire Hills]]).

The [[Kingdom of England]] – which after 1535 included Wales – ceased being a separate [[sovereign state]] on 1 May 1707, when the [[Acts of Union 1707|Acts of Union]] put into effect the terms agreed in the [[Treaty of Union]] the previous year, resulting in a political union with the [[Kingdom of Scotland]] to create the [[Kingdom of Great Britain]].<ref>William E.

==Toponymy{{Anchor|Etymology}}==<!--linked-->
{{See also|Toponymy of England}}
The name "England" is derived from the [[Old English]] name ''Englaland'', which means "land of the [[Angles]]".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=England |title=England |publisher=Online Etymology Dictionary |accessdate=21 July 2010}}</ref> The Angles were one of the [[Germanic tribes]] that settled in Great Britain during the [[Early Middle Ages]]. The Angles came from the [[Anglia (peninsula)|Anglia]] peninsula in the [[Bay of Kiel]] area (present-day German state of [[Schleswig–Holstein]]) of the [[Baltic Sea]].<ref>{{harvnb|Ripley|1869|p=570}}.</ref> The earliest recorded use of the term, as "Engla londe", is in the late-ninth-century translation into [[Old English]] of [[Bede]]'s ''[[Ecclesiastical History of the English People]]''. The term was then used in a different sense to the modern one, meaning "the land inhabited by the English", and it included English people in what is now south-east Scotland but was then part of the English kingdom of [[Northumbria]]. The ''[[Anglo-Saxon Chronicle]]'' recorded that the [[Domesday Book]] of 1086 covered the whole of England, meaning the English kingdom, but a few years later the ''Chronicle'' stated that King [[Malcolm III]] went "out of Scotlande into [[Lothian]] in Englaland", thus using it in the more ancient sense.{{sfn|Molyneaux|2015|pp=6–7}} According to the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'', its modern spelling was first used in 1538.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/62243 |title=England |publisher=[[Oxford English Dictionary]] |accessdate=12 July 2013}}</ref>

The earliest attested reference to the Angles occurs in the 1st-century work by [[Tacitus]], ''[[Germania (book)|Germania]]'', in which the [[Latin]] word ''Anglii'' is used.<ref name="Fordham">{{cite web |url=http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/basis/tacitus-germanygord.html |title=Germania |publisher=[[Tacitus]] |accessdate=5 September 2009}}</ref> The etymology of the tribal name itself is disputed by scholars; it has been suggested that it derives from the shape of the Angeln peninsula, an ''angular'' shape.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://dictionary.oed.com/cgi/entry/50075354?single=1&query_type=word&queryword=Angle&first=1&max_to_show=10 |title=Angle |publisher=[[Oxford English Dictionary]] |accessdate=5 September 2009}}{{dead link|date=October 2017|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref> How and why a term derived from the name of a tribe that was less significant than others, such as the [[Saxons]], came to be used for the entire country and its people is not known, but it seems this is related to the custom of calling the Germanic people in Britain ''Angli Saxones'' or English Saxons to distinguish them from continental Saxons (Eald-Seaxe) of Old Saxony between Weser and Eider rivers in Northern Germany.<ref>{{harvnb|Crystal|2004| pp=26–27}}</ref> In [[Scottish Gaelic]], another language which developed on the island of Great Britain, the Saxon tribe gave their name to the word for England (''Sasunn'');<ref>{{cite book |last=Forbes |first=John |title=The Principles of Gaelic Grammar |year=1848 |publisher=Oliver, Boyd and Tweeddale |location=Edinburgh}}</ref> similarly, the Welsh name for the English language is "''Saesneg''".

An alternative name for England is [[Albion]]. The name ''Albion'' originally referred to the entire island of Great Britain. The nominally earliest record of the name appears in the [[Aristotle|Aristotelian]] [[Corpus Aristotelicum|Corpus]], specifically the 4th-century BC ''[[On the Cosmos|De Mundo]]'':<ref name="massey">{{harvnb|Massey|2007|p=440}}.</ref> "Beyond the [[Pillars of Hercules]] is the ocean that flows round the earth. In it are two very large islands called Britannia; these are Albion and [[Ireland|Ierne]]".<ref name="massey" /><ref name="ArOntheCosmos">[[Greek language|Greek]] {{lang|grc|"...&nbsp;ἐν τούτῳ γε μὴν νῆσοι μέγιστοι τυγχάνουσιν οὖσαι δύο, Βρεττανικαὶ λεγόμεναι, Ἀλβίων καὶ Ἰέρνη,&nbsp;...", transliteration "...&nbsp;en toutoi ge men nesoi megistoi tynchanousin ousai dyo, Brettanikai legomenai, Albion kai Ierne,&nbsp;..."}}, translation "...&nbsp;There are two very large islands in it, called the British Isles, Albion and Ierne;&nbsp;..."; {{cite book |last=[[Aristotle]] or [[Pseudo-Aristotle]]|translator-first1=E.

The word ''Albion'' (Ἀλβίων) or ''insula Albionum'' has two possible origins. It either derives from a cognate of the Latin ''albus'' meaning white, a reference to the [[white cliffs of Dover]] (the only part of Britain visible from the European mainland)<ref>{{harvnb|Room|2006|p=23}}.</ref> or from the phrase the "island of the ''Albiones''"<ref>{{harvnb|Major|2004|p=84}}.</ref> in the now lost ''[[Massaliote Periplus]]'', that is attested through [[Avienus]]' ''Ora Maritima''<ref>[[Avienus]]' ''Ora Maritima'', verses 111–112, i.e. ''eamque late gens Hiernorum colit; propinqua rursus insula Albionum patet''.</ref> to which the former presumably served as a source. ''Albion'' is now applied to England in a more poetic capacity.<ref>{{harvnb|Foster|1988|p=9}}.</ref> Another romantic name for England is [[Lloegyr|Loegria]], related to the [[Welsh language|Welsh]] word for England, ''Lloegr'', and made popular by its use in [[Arthurian legend]].

After the last [[Last glacial period|ice age]] only large mammals such as [[mammoth]]s, [[bison]] and [[woolly rhinoceros]] remained. Roughly 11,000&nbsp;years ago, when the [[ice sheets]] began to recede, humans repopulated the area; genetic research suggests they came from the northern part of the [[Iberian Peninsula]].<ref>{{harvnb|Oppenheimer|2006|p=173}}.</ref> The sea level was lower than now and Britain was connected by [[land bridge]] to Ireland and [[Eurasia]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.qpg.geog.cam.ac.uk/research/projects/tertiaryrivers/tectonics.html |title=Tertiary Rivers: Tectonic and structural background |publisher=University of Cambridge |accessdate=9 September 2009}}</ref>
As the seas rose, it was separated from Ireland 10,000&nbsp;years ago and from Eurasia two millennia later.

The [[Beaker culture]] arrived around 2,500&nbsp;BC, introducing drinking and food vessels constructed from clay, as well as vessels used as reduction pots to smelt copper ores.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://tp.revistas.csic.es/index.php/tp/article/viewFile/5/5 |title=Function and significance of Bell Beaker pottery according to data from residue analyses |accessdate=21 December 2010}}</ref> It was during this time that major [[Neolithic]] monuments such as [[Stonehenge]] and [[Avebury]] were constructed. By heating together tin and copper, which were in abundance in the area, the Beaker culture people made [[bronze]], and later iron from iron ores.

During the [[British Iron Age|Iron Age]], [[Celts|Celtic culture]], deriving from the [[Hallstatt culture|Hallstatt]] and [[La Tène culture]]s, arrived from Central Europe. [[British language (Celtic)|Brythonic]] was the spoken language during this time. Society was tribal; according to [[Ptolemy]]'s ''[[Geographia]]'' there were around 20 tribes in the area. Earlier divisions are unknown because the Britons were not literate. Like other regions on the edge of the Empire, Britain had long enjoyed trading links with the Romans.

There is debate about when Christianity was first introduced; it was no later than the 4th century, probably much earlier. According to [[Bede]], missionaries were sent from Rome by [[Pope Eleuterus|Eleutherius]] at the request of the chieftain [[Lucius of Britain]] in 180 AD, to settle differences as to Eastern and Western ceremonials, which were disturbing the church. There are traditions linked to Glastonbury claiming an introduction through [[Joseph of Arimathea]], while others claim through [[Lucius of Britain]].<ref>{{harvnb|Wright|2008|p=143}}.</ref> By 410, during the [[Decline of the Roman Empire]], Britain was left exposed by the [[end of Roman rule in Britain]] and the withdrawal of Roman army units, to defend the frontiers in continental Europe and partake in civil wars.<ref name="james_anglosaxons" /> Celtic Christian monastic and missionary movements flourished: [[Saint Patrick|Patrick]] (5th-century Ireland) and in the 6th century Brendan (Clonfert), Comgall (Bangor), David (Wales), Aiden (Lindisfarne) and Columba (Iona). This period of Christianity was influenced by ancient Celtic culture in its sensibilities, polity, practices and theology. Local "congregations" were centred in the monastic community and monastic leaders were more like chieftains, as peers, rather than in the more hierarchical system of the Roman-dominated church.<ref>See ''Early Christian Christianity'', Brendan Lehane, Constable, London: John Murray Ltd., 1968</ref>

[[Military of ancient Rome|Roman military]] withdrawals left Britain open to invasion by pagan, seafaring warriors from north-western continental Europe, chiefly the Saxons, [[Angles]], [[Jutes]] and Frisians who had long raided the coasts of the Roman province and began to settle, initially in the eastern part of the country.<ref name="james_anglosaxons">{{cite web |title=Overview: Anglo-Saxons, 410 to 800 |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/ancient/anglo_saxons/overview_anglo_saxons_01.shtml |publisher=BBC |accessdate=3 December 2010 |first=Edward |last=James}}</ref> Their advance was contained for some decades after the Britons' victory at the [[Battle of Badon|Battle of Mount Badon]], but subsequently resumed, over-running the fertile lowlands of Britain and reducing the area under [[Britons (historical)|Brythonic]] control to a series of separate enclaves in the more rugged country to the west by the end of the 6th century. Contemporary texts describing this period are extremely scarce, giving rise to its description as a [[Dark Age]]. The nature and progression of the [[Anglo-Saxon settlement of Britain]] is consequently subject to considerable disagreement. Roman-dominated Christianity had, in general, disappeared from the conquered territories, but was reintroduced by missionaries from Rome led by [[Augustine of Canterbury|Augustine]] from 597 onwards.<ref>{{cite web |title=The Christian Tradition |url=http://www.picturesofengland.com/history/england-history-p4.html |publisher=PicturesofEngland.com |accessdate=5 September 2009}}</ref> Disputes between the Roman- and Celtic-dominated forms of Christianity ended in victory for the Roman tradition at the [[Council of Whitby]] (664), which was ostensibly about haircuts and the date of Easter, but more significantly, about the differences in Roman and Celtic forms of authority, theology, and practice (Lehane).

During the settlement period the lands ruled by the incomers seem to have been fragmented into numerous tribal territories, but by the 7th century, when substantial evidence of the situation again becomes available, these had coalesced into roughly a dozen kingdoms including [[Northumbria]], [[Mercia]], [[Wessex]], [[Kingdom of East Anglia|East Anglia]], [[Kingdom of Essex|Essex]], [[Kingdom of Kent|Kent]] and [[Kingdom of Sussex|Sussex]]. Over the following centuries, this process of political consolidation continued.<ref>{{harvnb|Kirby|2000|p=4}}</ref> The 7th century saw a struggle for hegemony between Northumbria and Mercia, which in the 8th century gave way to Mercian preeminence.<ref>{{harvnb|Lyon|1960|p=23}}.</ref> In the early 9th century Mercia was displaced as the foremost kingdom by Wessex. Later in that century escalating attacks by the [[Danes (Germanic tribe)|Danes]] culminated in the conquest of the north and east of England, overthrowing the kingdoms of Northumbria, Mercia and East Anglia. Wessex under [[Alfred the Great]] was left as the only surviving English kingdom, and under his successors, it steadily expanded at the expense of the kingdoms of the [[Danelaw]]. This brought about the political unification of England, first accomplished under [[Æthelstan]] in 927 and definitively established after further conflicts by [[Eadred]] in 953. A fresh wave of Scandinavian attacks from the late 10th century ended with the conquest of this united kingdom by [[Sweyn Forkbeard]] in 1013 and again by his son [[Cnut the Great|Cnut]] in 1016, turning it into the centre of a short-lived [[North Sea Empire]] that also included [[Kingdom of Denmark|Denmark]] and [[Norway]]. However, the native royal dynasty was restored with the accession of [[Edward the Confessor]] in 1042.

[[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]] broke from communion with the Catholic Church, over issues relating to his divorce, under the [[Acts of Supremacy]] in 1534 which proclaimed the monarch head of the [[Church of England]]. In contrast with much of European Protestantism, the [[English Reformation|roots of the split]] were more political than theological.{{refn|As [[Roger Scruton]] explains, "The Reformation must not be confused with the changes introduced into the Church of England during the 'Reformation Parliament' of 1529–36, which were of a political rather than a religious nature, designed to unite the secular and religious sources of authority within a single sovereign power: the Anglican Church did not make substantial change in doctrine until later."<ref>{{harvnb|Scruton|1982|p=470}}.</ref>|group=nb}} He also legally incorporated his ancestral land Wales into the Kingdom of England with the [[Laws in Wales Acts 1535–1542|1535–1542 acts]]. There were internal religious conflicts during the reigns of Henry's daughters, [[Mary I of England|Mary I]] and [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth I]]. The former took the country back to Catholicism while the latter broke from it again, forcefully asserting the supremacy of [[Anglicanism]].

Competing with [[Spanish Empire|Spain]], the first English colony in the Americas was founded in 1585 by explorer [[Walter Raleigh]] in [[Virginia]] and named [[Roanoke Colony|Roanoke]].

During the [[Elizabethan period]], England was at war with Spain. An [[Spanish Armada|armada]] sailed from Spain in 1588 as part of a wider plan to invade England and re-establish a Catholic monarchy. The plan was thwarted by bad coordination, stormy weather and successful harrying attacks by an English fleet under [[Charles Howard, 1st Earl of Nottingham|Lord Howard of Effingham]]. This failure did not end the threat: Spain launched two further armadas, in [[2nd Spanish Armada|1596]] and [[3rd Spanish Armada|1597]], but both were driven back by storms. The political structure of the island changed in 1603, when the [[King of Scots]], [[James VI of Scotland|James VI]], a kingdom which had been a long-time rival to English interests, inherited the throne of England as [[James VI and I|James I]], thereby creating a [[Union of the Crowns|personal union]].<ref name="Britons">{{harvnb|Colley|1992|p=12}}.</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Making the Act of Union |url=http://www.parliament.uk/actofunion/01_background.html |publisher=Parliament.uk |accessdate=5 September 2009 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080609075346/http://www.parliament.uk/actofunion/01_background.html |archivedate=9 June 2008}}</ref> He styled himself [[King of Great Britain]], although this had no basis in English law.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://ads.ahds.ac.uk/catalogue/adsdata/PSAS_2002/pdf/vol_089/89_055_066.pdf |title=The term "Great Britain" in the Middle Ages |last=Hay |first=Denys |publisher=ads.ahds.ac.uk |accessdate=19 February 2009 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090325061737/http://ads.ahds.ac.uk/catalogue/adsdata/PSAS_2002/pdf/vol_089/89_055_066.pdf |archivedate=25 March 2009 |format=PDF}}</ref> Under the auspices of King James VI and I the Authorised [[King James Version]] of the Holy Bible was published in 1611.

As the United Kingdom is a member of the European Union, there are elections held regionally in England to decide who is sent as [[Members of the European Parliament]]. The [[European Parliament election, 2014 (United Kingdom)|2014 European Parliament election]] saw the regions of England elect the following MEPs: 22 [[UK Independence Party]] (UKIP), 17 Conservatives, 17 Labour, 3 [[Green Party of England and Wales|Greens]], and one Liberal Democrat.

Since [[devolution]], in which other countries of the United Kingdom – Scotland, Wales and [[Northern Ireland]] – each have their own devolved parliament or assemblies for local issues, there has been debate about how to counterbalance this in England.

Despite now being part of the United Kingdom, the legal system of the [[Courts of England and Wales]] continued, under the [[Treaty of Union]], as a separate legal system from the one used in Scotland.

The [[Courts of England and Wales|court system]] is headed by the Senior Courts of England and Wales, consisting of the [[Court of Appeal of England and Wales|Court of Appeal]], the [[High Court of Justice]] for civil cases, and the [[Crown Court]] for criminal cases.<ref>{{harvnb|Fafinski|2007|p=127}}.</ref> The [[Supreme Court of the United Kingdom]] is the highest court for criminal and civil cases in [[England and Wales]].

The [[subdivisions of England]] consist of up to four levels of [[administrative division|subnational division]] controlled through a variety of types of administrative entities created for the purposes of [[local government in England|local government]]. The highest tier of local government were the nine [[regions of England]]: [[North East England|North East]], [[North West England|North West]], [[Yorkshire and the Humber]], [[East Midlands]], [[West Midlands (region)|West Midlands]], [[East of England|East]], [[South East England|South East]], [[South West England|South West]], and London. These were created in 1994 as [[Government Office]]s, used by the UK government to deliver a wide range of policies and programmes regionally, but there are no elected bodies at this level, except in London, and in 2011 the regional government offices were abolished.<ref>{{cite news |title=Tiers shed as regional government offices disappear |url=https://www.theguardian.com/society/2011/mar/29/regional-government-disappears-1500-jobs-lost |work=The Guardian |accessdate=16 June 2011 |location=London |first=Hilary |last=Cooper |date=29 March 2011}}</ref> The same boundaries remain in use for electing [[Members of the European Parliament]] on a regional basis.

There are six [[metropolitan county|metropolitan counties]] based on the most heavily urbanised areas, which do not have county councils.<ref name="localgov" /> In these areas the principal authorities are the councils of the subdivisions, the [[metropolitan borough]]s. Elsewhere, 27 [[non-metropolitan county|non-metropolitan "shire" counties]] have a [[county council]] and are divided into districts, each with a district council. They are typically, though not always, found in more rural areas. The remaining non-metropolitan counties are of a single district and usually correspond to large towns or sparsely populated counties; they are known as [[Unitary authorities of England|unitary authorities]]. Greater London has a different system for local government, with 32 [[London borough]]s, plus the [[City of London]] covering a small area at the core governed by the [[City of London Corporation]].<ref>{{harvnb|Axford|2002|p=315}}.</ref> At the most localised level, much of England is divided into [[civil parishes in England|civil parishes]] with [[Parish councils in England|councils]]; in Greater London only one, [[Queen's Park, London|Queen's Park]], exists {{as of|2014|lc=y}} after they were [[London Government Act 1963|abolished in 1965]] until legislation [[Local Government and Public Involvement in Health Act 2007|allowed their recreation]] in 2007.

These lines are mostly standard gauge ([[single track (rail)|single]], [[double track|double]] or [[quadruple track]]) though there are also a few [[British narrow gauge railways|narrow gauge lines]]. There is rail transport access to France and Belgium through an undersea rail link, the [[Channel Tunnel]], which was completed in 1994.

The way that this is often expressed is by saying that the Church of England is both 'catholic and reformed.'}}</ref>

[[Anglo-Saxon architecture|Early Medieval architecture's]] secular buildings were simple constructions mainly using timber with [[thatch]] for roofing. Ecclesiastical architecture ranged from a synthesis of [[Early Christian Ireland|Hiberno]]–[[Germanic Christianity|Saxon]] [[monasticism]],<ref>{{harvnb|Colgrave|1985|p=326}}.</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Pevsner|1942|p=14}}.</ref> to [[Early Christian art and architecture|Early Christian]] [[basilica]] and architecture characterised by pilaster-strips, blank arcading, baluster shafts and triangular headed openings. After the Norman conquest in 1066 various [[Castles in England]] were created so law lords could uphold their authority and in the north to protect from invasion. Some of the best-known medieval castles are the [[Tower of London]], [[Warwick Castle]], [[Durham Castle]] and [[Windsor Castle]].<ref name="buildings" />

Throughout the Plantagenet era, an [[English Gothic architecture]] flourished, with prime examples including the [[Architecture of the medieval cathedrals of England|medieval cathedrals]] such as [[Canterbury Cathedral]], [[Westminster Abbey]] and [[York Minster]].<ref name="buildings">{{harvnb|Atkinson|2008|p=189}}.</ref> Expanding on the [[Norman architecture|Norman base]] there was also [[castle]]s, [[palace]]s, [[List of historic houses in England|great houses]], universities and [[parish church]]es. Medieval architecture was completed with the 16th-century [[Tudor architecture|Tudor style]]; the four-centred arch, now known as the [[Tudor arch]], was a defining feature as were [[wattle and daub]] houses domestically. In the aftermath of the [[Renaissance]] a form of architecture echoing classical antiquity synthesised with Christianity appeared, the [[English Baroque]] style of architect [[Christopher Wren]] being particularly championed.<ref>{{harvnb|Downes|2007|p=17}}.</ref>

[[Georgian architecture]] followed in a more refined style, evoking a simple Palladian form; the [[Royal Crescent]] at Bath is one of the best examples of this. With the emergence of [[romanticism]] during Victorian period, a [[Gothic Revival]] was launched. In addition to this, around the same time the Industrial Revolution paved the way for buildings such as [[The Crystal Palace]]. Since the 1930s various [[modernist architecture|modernist]] forms have appeared whose reception is often controversial, though traditionalist resistance movements continue with support in influential places.{{refn|While people such as [[Norman Foster (architect)|Norman Foster]] and [[Richard Rogers]] represent the modernist movement, [[Prince Charles]] since the 1980s has voiced strong views against it in favour of traditional architecture and put his ideas into practice at his [[Poundbury]] development in Dorset.<ref name=ArchCon4>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/8045027.stm |publisher=BBC News |title=Architects to hear Prince appeal |date=12 May 2009 |accessdate=20 June 2009}}</ref> Architects like [[Raymond Erith]], [[Francis Johnson (architect)|Francis Johnson]] and [[Quinlan Terry]] continued to practise in the classical style.|group=nb}}

English folklore developed over many centuries. Some of the characters and stories are present across England, but most belong to specific regions. Common folkloric beings include [[pixie]]s, [[giant (mythology)|giants]], [[elf|elves]], [[bogeymen]], [[troll]]s, [[goblin]]s and [[dwarf (mythology)|dwarves]]. While many legends and folk-customs are thought to be ancient, for instance the tales featuring [[Offa of Angel]] and [[Wayland the Smith]],<ref name="keary">{{harvnb|Keary|1882|p=50}}.</ref> others date from after the Norman invasion; [[Robin Hood]] and his [[Merry Men]] of [[Sherwood Forest|Sherwood]] and their battles with the [[Sheriff of Nottingham]] being, perhaps, the best known.<ref>{{harvnb|Pollard|2004|p=272}}.</ref>

Some folk figures are based on semi or actual historical people whose story has been passed down centuries; [[Lady Godiva]] for instance was said to have ridden naked on horseback through [[Coventry]], [[Hereward the Wake]] was a heroic English figure resisting the Norman invasion, [[Herne the Hunter]] is an [[equestrianism|equestrian]] ghost associated with [[Windsor, Berkshire|Windsor]] Forest and [[Windsor Great Park|Great Park]] and [[Mother Shipton]] is the archetypal witch.<ref>{{harvnb|Briggs|2004|p=26}}.</ref> On 5 November people make bonfires, set off [[fireworks]] and eat [[toffee apple]]s in [[Guy Fawkes Night|commemoration]] of the foiling of the [[Gunpowder Plot]] centred on [[Guy Fawkes]].
