The [[Massachusetts Bay Colony]] was named after the indigenous population, the [[Massachusett]], likely derived from a Wôpanâak word ''muswach8sut'', segmented as ''mus(ây)'' "big" + ''wach8'' "mountain" + ''-s'' "diminutive" + -''ut'' "locative" (the '8' in these words refers to the 'oo' sound according to the Wôpanâak orthographic chart).<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://dspace.mit.edu/handle/1721.1/8740|title=Introduction to Wampanoag Grammar|last=Fermino|first=Jessie Little Doe|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref> It has been translated as "near the great hill",<ref>{{cite book| first=William Wallace| last=Tooker| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=U5cqAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA175| title=Algonquian Names of some Mountains and Hills| year=1904| accessdate=June 10, 2015}}</ref> "by the blue hills", "at the little big hill", or "at the range of hills", referring to the [[Blue Hills Reservation|Blue Hills]], or in particular the [[Great Blue Hill]] which is located on the boundary of [[Milton, Massachusetts|Milton]] and [[Canton, Massachusetts|Canton]].<ref>Salwen, Bert, 1978.

Adams was highly involved in the push for separation from Britain and the writing of the [[Constitution of Massachusetts]] in 1780 which, in the [[Elizabeth Freeman]] and [[Quock Walker]] cases, effectively made Massachusetts the first state to have a constitution that declared universal rights and, as interpreted by Supreme Judicial Court Chief Justice [[William Cushing]], abolished slavery.

During the 19th century, Massachusetts became a national leader in the American [[Industrial Revolution]], with factories around cities such as [[Lowell, Massachusetts|Lowell]] and [[Boston]] producing textiles and shoes, and factories around Springfield producing tools, paper, and textiles.{{sfn|Brown|Tager|2000|p=129}}{{sfn|Brown|Tager|2000|p=211}} The economy transformed from one based primarily on agriculture to an industrial one, initially making use of water-power and later the [[steam engine]] to power factories.

Although Massachusetts was the first slave-holding colony dating back to the early 1600s, in the years leading up to the [[American Civil War]], Massachusetts was a center of [[progressivism|progressivist]] and [[Abolitionism|abolitionist]] activity.

Although significant opposition to abolitionism existed early on in Massachusetts, resulting in anti-abolitionist riots between 1835 and 1837,{{sfn|Brown|Tager|2000|p=185}} opposition to slavery gradually increased throughout the next few decades.{{sfn|Brown|Tager|2000|p=183}}{{sfn|Brown|Tager|2000|pp=187–93}} Abolitionists [[John Brown (abolitionist)|John Brown]] and [[Sojourner Truth]] lived in Springfield and Northampton, respectively, while [[Frederick Douglass]] lived in Boston and [[Susan B.

With the exodus of several manufacturing companies, the area's industrial economy began to decline during the early 20th century. By the 1920s, competition from the South and Midwest, followed by the [[Great Depression]], led to the collapse of the three main industries in Massachusetts: textiles, shoemaking, and precision mechanics.<ref>Brown and Tager, p. 246.</ref> This decline would continue into the later half of the century; between 1950 and 1979, the number of Massachusetts residents involved in textile manufacturing declined from 264,000 to 63,000.{{sfn|Brown|Tager|2000|p=276}} The 1969 closure of the [[Springfield Armory]], in particular, spurred an exodus of high-paying jobs from Western Massachusetts, which suffered greatly as it de-industrialized during the last 40 years of the 20th century.<ref>{{cite journal |publisher=[[University of Massachusetts Lowell]] |url=http://www.uml.edu/com/cita/05paperforrantmuckensturm.pdf |title=Job Loss, Shrinking Revenues, and Grinding Decline in Springfield, Massachusetts: Is A Finance Control Board the Answer? |accessdate=June 10, 2015}}</ref>

Massachusetts is the [[List of U.S. states and territories by area|7th-smallest state in the United States]]. It is located in the [[New England]] region of the northeastern United States and has an area of {{convert|10555|sqmi|km2}}, 25.7% of which is water. Several large [[headlands and bays|bays]] distinctly shape its coast. Boston is the largest city, at the inmost point of [[Massachusetts Bay]], and the mouth of the [[Charles River]].

Despite its small size, Massachusetts features numerous [[topography|topographically]] distinctive regions. The large [[coastal plain]] of the Atlantic Ocean in the eastern section of the state contains [[Greater Boston]], along with most of the state's population,<ref name=GreaterBoston /> as well as the distinctive [[Cape Cod]] [[peninsula]]. To the west lies the hilly, rural region of [[Central Massachusetts]], and beyond that, the [[Connecticut River|Connecticut River Valley]]. Along the western border of [[Western Massachusetts]] lies the highest elevated part of the state, [[the Berkshires]].

===Climate===
[[File:MA koppen.svg|upright=1.35|thumb|[[Köppen climate]] types in Massachusetts]]
Most of Massachusetts has a [[humid continental climate|humid continental]], with cold winters and warm summers. Far southeast coastal areas are the broad transition zone to temperate climates (humid subtropical climate in some classifications). The warm to hot summers render the [[oceanic climate]] rare in this transition, only applying to exposed coastal areas such as on the peninsula of [[Barnstable County, Massachusetts|Barnstable County]]. The climate of [[Boston]] is quite representative for the commonwealth, characterized by summer highs of around {{convert|81|F|C}} and winter highs of {{convert|35|F|C}}, and is quite wet. Frosts are frequent all winter, even in coastal areas due to prevailing inland winds. Due to its location near the [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]], Massachusetts is vulnerable to [[nor'easters]], [[tropical cyclone|hurricanes and tropical storms]].

===Religion===
Massachusetts was founded and settled by [[Brownist]] [[Puritans]] in 1620<ref name=puritans/> and soon after by other groups of [[Ecclesiastical separatism|Separatists]]/[[English dissenters|Dissenters]], [[Nonconformist]]s and [[Independent (religion)|Independents]] from [[17th-century denominations in England|17th century England]].{{sfn|Goldfield|Abbott|Anderson|Argersinger|1998|pp=29–30}} Most people in Massachusetts today remain [[Christians]].<ref name=qcensus/> The descendants of the Puritans belong to many different churches; in the direct line of inheritance are the various [[Congregational church]]es, the [[United Church of Christ]] and  congregations of the [[Unitarian Universalist Association]]. The headquarters of the [[Unitarian Universalist Association]], long located on [[Beacon Hill, Boston|Beacon Hill]], is now located in [[South Boston]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.uua.org/headquarters |title=Headquarters of the Unitarian Universalist Association |publisher=Unitarian Universalist Association |accessdate=April 27, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.uua.org/news/press-release/uua-sell-its-beacon-hill-properties-move-innovation-district |title=The UUA to Sell its Beacon Hill Properties, Move to Innovation District |publisher=[[Unitarian Universalist Association]] |accessdate=April 10, 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150417012851/http://www.uua.org/news/press-release/uua-sell-its-beacon-hill-properties-move-innovation-district |archivedate=April 17, 2015 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> Many Puritan descendants also dispersed to other Protestant denominations. Some disaffiliated along with Roman Catholics and other Christian groups in the wake of modern [[secularization]].

Today, Christians make up 57% of the state's population, with [[Protestantism|Protestants]] making up 21% of them. [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholics]] make up 34% and now predominate because of massive immigration from primarily Catholic countries and regions – chiefly Ireland, Italy, Poland, Portugal, Quebec, and Latin America. Both Protestant and Roman Catholic communities have been in decline since the late 20th century, due to the rise of [[irreligion]] in [[New England]]. It is the most irreligious region of the country, along with the [[Western United States]]. A significant Jewish population immigrated to the Boston and Springfield areas between 1880 and 1920. [[Jews]] currently make up 3% of the population. [[Mary Baker Eddy]] made the [[Christian Science Center|Boston Mother Church]] of [[Christian Science]] serve as the world headquarters of this [[new religious movement]]. [[Buddhism|Buddhists]], [[Paganism|Pagans]], [[Hindu]]s, [[Seventh-day Adventist Church|Seventh-day Adventists]], [[Muslim]]s, and [[Mormons]] may also be found. [[Kripalu Center]] in [[Stockbridge, Massachusetts|Stockbridge]], the Shaolin Meditation Temple in Springfield, and the Insight Meditation Center in [[Barre, Massachusetts|Barre]] are examples of non-Abrahamic religious centers in Massachusetts. According to 2010 data from The [[Association of Religion Data Archives]], (ARDA) the largest single denominations are the [[Catholic Church]] with 2,940,199 adherents; the [[United Church of Christ]] with 86,639 adherents; and the [[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopal Church]] with 81,999 adherents.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.thearda.com/rcms2010/r/s/25/rcms2010_25_state_family_2010.asp |title=The Association of Religion Data Archives &#124; State Membership Report |publisher=[[Association of Religion Data Archives]] |accessdate=November 22, 2013}}</ref> 32% of the population identifies as having no religion.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.pewforum.org/religious-landscape-study/state/massachusetts/ |title=Adults in Massachusetts |date=May 11, 2015 |publisher=Pew Research Center's Religion & Public Life Project}}</ref>

[[File:United States presidential election in Massachusetts, 2016.svg|thumb|[[Treemap]] of the popular vote by county, 2016 presidential election.]]
Throughout the mid 20th century, Massachusetts has gradually shifted from a [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]]-leaning state to one [[red states and blue states|largely dominated]] by [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrats]]; the [[United States Senate election in Massachusetts, 1952|1952 victory]] of [[John F. Kennedy]] over incumbent Senator [[Henry Cabot Lodge, Jr.]] is seen as a watershed moment in this transformation. His younger brother [[Ted Kennedy|Edward M. Kennedy]] held that seat until his death from a brain tumor in 2009.{{sfn|Brown|Tager|2000|p=310}} Massachusetts has since gained a reputation as being a politically liberal state and is often used as an archetype of [[modern liberalism in the United States|modern liberalism]], hence the usage of the phrase "[[Massachusetts liberal]]."<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.usatoday.com/news/politicselections/nation/president/2004-07-25-mass-liberal_x.htm |title=Does 'Massachusetts liberal' label still matter? |first1=Susan |last1=Page |first2=Jill |last2=Lawrence |publisher=[[USA Today]] |date=July 11, 2004 |accessdate=October 17, 2009}}</ref>

Massachusetts routinely votes for the Democratic Party, with the core concentrations in the Boston metro area, the Cape and Islands, and Western Massachusetts outside Hampden County. Pockets of Republican strength are in the central areas along the I-495 crescent, Hampden County, and communities on the south and north shores,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.r-bloggers.com/mapping-ma-election-results/ |publisher=R-bloggers |title=Mapping MA election results |accessdate=June 10, 2015}}</ref> but the state as a whole has not given its [[Electoral College (United States)|Electoral College]] votes to a Republican in a [[United States presidential election|presidential election]] since [[Ronald Reagan]] carried it in [[United States presidential election, 1984|1984]]. Additionally, Massachusetts provided Reagan with his smallest margins of victory in both the [[United States presidential election, 1980|1980]]<ref>{{cite web |title=1980 Presidential General Election Results – Massachusetts |url=http://uselectionatlas.org/RESULTS/state.php?f=0&fips=25&year=1980 |publisher=[[Dave Leip's Atlas of U.S. Presidential Elections]] |accessdate=May 5, 2015}}</ref> and 1984 elections.<ref>{{cite web |title=1984 Presidential General Election Results – Massachusetts |url=http://uselectionatlas.org/RESULTS/state.php?f=0&fips=25&year=1984 |publisher=[[Dave Leip's Atlas of U.S. Presidential Elections]] |accessdate=May 5, 2015}}</ref>

When averaging the presidential election results from 2000 to 2016 in Massachusetts, Democratic nominees collected 60.8% of the vote compared to 35.1% for Republican nominees.<ref name="Leip, David"/> However, among gubernatorial election results from 2002 to 2018, Republican nominees garnered 48.4% of the vote compared to 45.7% for Democratic nominees.<ref name="Leip, David"/> Despite the state's Democratic-leaning, Democrats have an absolute grip on its congressional delegation; there are no Republicans elected to serve at the federal level. Both Senators and all nine Representatives are Democrats. Massachusetts is the most populous state to be represented in the [[United States Congress]] entirely by a single party.

As of the 2018 elections, the Democratic Party holds a super majority over the Republican Party in [[Bicameralism|both chambers]] of the [[Massachusetts General Court]] (state legislature). Out of the [[Massachusetts House of Representatives|state house]]'s 160 seats, Democrats hold 127 seats (79%) compared to the Republican Party's 32 seats (20%), an [[Susannah Whipps|independent sits in the remaining one]],<ref>{{cite web |title=Members of the House of Representatives |url=https://malegislature.gov/People/House |publisher=[[Massachusetts House of Representatives]] |accessdate=January 18, 2019}}</ref> and 34 out of the 40 seats in the [[Massachusetts state senate|state senate]] (85%) belong to the Democratic Party compared to the Republican Party's six seats (15%).<ref>{{cite web |title=Members of the Senate |url=https://malegislature.gov/People/Senate |publisher=[[Massachusetts Senate]] |accessdate=January 18, 2019}}</ref>

Massachusetts has contributed to American arts and culture. Drawing from its [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] and [[Yankee]] roots, along with later immigrant groups, Massachusetts has produced a number of writers, artists, and musicians.
