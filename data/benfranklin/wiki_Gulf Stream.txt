The '''Gulf Stream''', together with its northern extension the [[North Atlantic Current|North Atlantic Drift]], is a warm and swift [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]] [[ocean current]] that originates in the [[Gulf of Mexico]] and stretches to the tip of [[Florida]], and follows the eastern coastlines of the United States and [[Newfoundland and Labrador|Newfoundland]] before crossing the Atlantic Ocean. The process of [[Boundary current|western intensification]] causes the Gulf Stream to be a northward accelerating current off the east coast of North America. At about {{Coord|40|0|N|30|0|W}}, it splits in two, with the northern stream, the North Atlantic Drift, crossing to Northern Europe and the southern stream, the [[Canary Current]], recirculating off West Africa.

The Gulf Stream influences the climate of the east coast of North America from [[Florida]] to [[Newfoundland]], and the west coast of Europe.  Although there has been recent debate, there is consensus that the climate of Western Europe and Northern Europe is warmer than it would otherwise be due to the [[North Atlantic drift]] which is the northeastern section of the Gulf Stream. It is part of the [[North Atlantic Gyre]]. Its presence has led to the development of strong [[cyclone]]s of all types, both within the [[atmosphere]] and within the ocean. The Gulf Stream is also a significant potential source of [[renewable power]] generation.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}} The Gulf Stream may be [[Shutdown of thermohaline circulation|slowing down as a result of climate change]].

The Gulf Stream is typically 100 kilometres (62&nbsp;mi) wide and 800 metres (2,600&nbsp;ft) to 1,200 metres (3,900&nbsp;ft) deep. The current velocity is fastest near the surface, with the maximum speed typically about 2.5 metres per second (9 kph; 5.6&nbsp;mph).

[[File:Franklingulfstream.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|[[Benjamin Franklin]]'s chart of the Gulf Stream published in Philadelphia in 1786]]
European discovery of the Gulf Stream dates to the 1512 expedition of [[Juan Ponce de León]], after which it became widely used by Spanish ships sailing from the Caribbean to Spain.<ref>{{cite book |last= Fernandez-Armesto |first= Felipe |title= Pathfinders: A Global History of Exploration |year= 2006 |publisher= W.

[[Benjamin Franklin]] became interested in the [[Atlantic Ocean|North Atlantic Ocean]] circulation patterns. In 1768, while in England, Franklin heard a curious complaint from the Colonial Board of Customs: Why did it take British packets several weeks longer to reach New York from England than it took an average American merchant ship to reach [[Newport, Rhode Island]], despite the merchant ships leaving from London and having to sail down the [[River Thames]] and then the length of the [[English Channel]] before they sailed across the Atlantic, while the packets left from [[Falmouth, Cornwall|Falmouth]] in Cornwall?<ref name=tuchman>[[Barbara W. Tuchman|Tuchman, Barbara W.]] ''The First Salute: A View of the American Revolution'' New York: Ballantine Books, 1988. pp.221–222.</ref>

Franklin asked Timothy Folger, his cousin twice removed (Nantucket Historical Society), a [[Nantucket Island]] whaling captain, for an answer. Folger explained that merchant ships routinely crossed the then-unnamed Gulf Stream—identifying it by whale behavior, measurement of the water's temperature, and changes in the water's color—while the mail packet captains ran against it.<ref name=tuchman/> Franklin had Folger sketch the path of the Gulf Stream on an old chart of the Atlantic and add written notes on how to avoid the Stream when sailing from England to America. Franklin then forwarded the chart to Anthony Todd, secretary of the British Post Office.<ref name=tuchman /> Franklin's Gulf Stream chart was printed in 1769 in London, but it was mostly ignored by British sea captains.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.studyofplace.info/ActivityContent/Materials/OceanCurrents_Reading_BenFranklinGulfStream.pdf |title=Ben Franklin and the Gulf Stream |last=Isserman |first=Maurice |year=2002 |work=Study of place |publisher=TERC |accessdate=15 July 2010}}</ref> A copy of the chart was printed in Paris circa 1770–1773, and a third version was published by Franklin in Philadelphia in 1786.<ref name="Ocean explorer">{{cite web |url=http://oceanexplorer.noaa.gov/library/readings/gulf/gulf.html |title=1785: Benjamin Franklin's 'Sundry Maritime Observations' |author=Anon |work=Ocean Explorer: Readings for ocean explorers |publisher=NOAA Office of Ocean Exploration and Research |accessdate=15 July 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051218185445/http://oceanexplorer.noaa.gov/library/readings/gulf/gulf.html |archivedate=18 December 2005 |df= }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last1=Richardson |first1=Philip L. |last2=Adams |first2=Nathan T. |title=Uncharted Waters: Nantucket Whalers and the Franklin-Folger Chart of the Gulf Stream |journal=Historic Nantucket |date=Spring 2018 |volume=68 |issue=1 |pages=17–24 |url=https://issuu.com/nantuckethistoricalassociation/docs/hnspring_2018_3.5.18}}</ref> The inset in the upper left part of the 1786 chart is an illustration of the migration pattern of herring and not an ocean current.

A river of sea water, called the [[North Equatorial Current|Atlantic North Equatorial Current]], flows westward off the coast of Central Africa. When this current interacts with the northeastern coast of South America, the current forks into two branches. One passes into the [[Caribbean Sea]], while a second, the [[Antilles Current]], flows north and east of the [[Caribbean|West Indies]].<ref>{{cite web |author1=Elizabeth Rowe |author2=Arthur J.

Because of conservation of [[potential vorticity]] caused by the northward-moving winds on the [[subtropical ridge]]'s western periphery and the increased relative vorticity of northward moving water, transport is balanced by a narrow, accelerating poleward current. This flows along the western boundary of the ocean basin, outweighing the effects of friction with the western boundary current, and is known as the [[Labrador current]].<ref>{{cite book|author=Angela Colling|title=Ocean Circulation|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tFJRLhSez_YC&pg=PA96|year=2001|publisher=Butterworth-Heinemann|isbn=978-0-08-053794-8|page=96}}</ref>  The conservation of potential vorticity also causes bends along the Gulf Stream, which occasionally break off due to a shift in the Gulf Stream's position, forming separate warm and cold eddies.<ref>{{cite book|author=Maurice L.

As a consequence, the resulting Gulf Stream is a strong ocean current. It transports water at a rate of 30 million cubic meters per second (30 [[sverdrup]]s) through the Florida Straits.  As it passes south of [[Newfoundland (island)|Newfoundland]], this rate increases to 150 million cubic metres per second.<ref>{{cite web |author1=Joanna Gyory |author2=Arthur J.
