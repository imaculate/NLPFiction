  PLEASE READ THIS FIRST.
  The following references are WP:RS sources which are used per WP:RS/AC guideline.
  The issue has been discussed on the talk page at length
  See the "talk page FAQ" about it; it may answer your question.

  The main source says "scholars of antiquity", other sources say "scholars", "biblical scholars and classical historians" and "historians".

  Sources do not say "X scholars" or "Christian scholars", so do not modify it as such, for that will make it deviate from what the sources state.
  The source says "virtually all", so do NOT change it to "most", "several", "many", etc.

Most scholars conclude that these are written much later and are less reliable accounts than the canonical gospels.{{sfn|Brown|1997|pp=835–40}}<ref>{{cite book|last1=Evans|first1=C.A.|title=Exploring the Origins of the Bible|date=2008|publisher=Baker Academic|page=154}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last1=Keener|first1=Craig S.|title=The Historical Jesus of the Gospels|date=2009|publisher=Wm.

The canonical gospels are four accounts, each written by a different author. The authors of the gospels are all anonymous, attributed by tradition to the [[four evangelists]], each with close ties to Jesus:<ref name="5GIntro">{{cite book|first1=Robert W.| last1= Funk |first2= Roy W.|last2= Hoover |title = The Five Gospels |publisher= Harper |year= 1993 |p=3}}</ref> Mark by [[John Mark]], an associate of Peter;<ref name = "May Metzger Mark"/> Matthew by one of Jesus' disciples;<ref name = "5GIntro"/> Luke by a companion of Paul mentioned in a few epistles;<ref name = "5GIntro"/> and John by another of Jesus' disciples,<ref name = "5GIntro"/> the "[[beloved disciple]]".{{sfn|Cross|Livingstone|2005|loc=John, St.}}

One important aspect of the study of the gospels is the [[literary genre]] under which they fall. Genre "is a key convention guiding both the composition and the interpretation of writings".<ref>Burridge, R.A. (2006). Gospels. In J.W. Rogerson & Judith M. Lieu (Eds) ''The Oxford Handbook of Biblical Studies''. Oxford: Oxford University Press. p. 433</ref> Whether the gospel authors set out to write novels, myths, histories, or biographies has a tremendous impact on how they ought to be interpreted. Some recent studies suggest that the genre of the gospels ought to be situated within the realm of ancient [[biography]].<ref>Talbert, C.H. (1977). ''What is a Gospel?

Not everything contained in the New Testament gospels is considered to be historically reliable.{{sfn|Sanders|1993|p=3}} Views range from their being [[inerrancy|inerrant]] descriptions of the life of Jesus{{sfn|Grudem|1994|pp=90–91}} to their providing little historical information about his life beyond the basics.{{sfn|Köstenberger|Kellum|Quarles|2009|pp=117–25}}{{sfn|Ehrman|1999|pp=22–23}} According to a broad scholarly consensus, the [[Synoptic Gospels]] (Matthew, Mark, and Luke), and not John, are the most reliable sources of information about Jesus.{{sfn|Sanders|1993|p=71}}{{sfn|Theissen|Merz|1998|pp=17–62}}<ref name=Britannica/>

According to the [[Marcan priority]], the first to be written was the Gospel of Mark (written AD 60–75), followed by the Gospel of Matthew (AD 65–85), the Gospel of Luke (AD 65–95), and the Gospel of John (AD 75–100).<ref>{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=l2sloGWzzV8C&pg=PA58#v=onepage | title=Can We Trust the Gospels?: Investigating the Reliability of Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John | publisher=Crossway | year=2007 | page=58 | isbn=978-1-4335-1978-9 |first= Mark D. |last= Roberts}}</ref> Furthermore, most scholars agree that the authors of Matthew and Luke used Mark as a source when writing their gospels.

Jesus was Jewish,<ref name="Vermes 1981"/> born by Mary, wife of [[Saint Joseph|Joseph]] ({{bibleref2|Matthew|1}}; {{bibleref2|Luke|2}}).

Matthew and Luke each describe Jesus' birth, especially that Jesus was born by a virgin named Mary in [[Bethlehem]] in fulfillment of prophecy.

The Gospel of Mark reports that Jesus comes into conflict with his neighbors and family.{{sfn|Harris|1985|pp=270–72}}
Jesus' mother and brothers come to get him ({{bibleref2|Mark|3:31–35}}) because people are saying that [[Mental health of Jesus|he is crazy]] ({{bibleref2|Mark|3:21}}).
Jesus responds that his followers are his true family.
In John, Mary follows Jesus to his crucifixion, and he expresses concern over her well-being ({{bibleref2|John|19:25–27}}).

Jesus is called a τέκτων (''[[tektōn]]'') in [[s:Bible (American Standard)/Mark#6:3|Mark 6:3]], traditionally understood as [[carpenter]] but could cover makers of objects in various materials, including builders.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Liddell|first1=Henry G.|last2=Scott|first2=Robert|title=An Intermediate Greek–English Lexicon: The Seventh Edition of Liddell and Scott's Greek–English Lexicon |publisher=Clarendon Press|year=1889|page=797}}</ref>{{sfn|Dickson|2008| pp= 68–69}} The gospels indicate that Jesus could read, paraphrase, and debate scripture, but this does not necessarily mean that he received formal scribal training.<ref name="literacy">{{cite encyclopedia|editor-last=Bockmuehl |editor-first= Markus N.A. |title=Context, family and formation |first=Craig A. |last= Evans|year=2001|encyclopedia= Cambridge companion to Jesus|publisher= Cambridge University Press |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vSehrtQpcYcC&pg=PA14#v=onepage |isbn=978-0-521-79678-1|pages=14, 21}}</ref>

When Jesus is presented as a baby in the temple per Jewish Law, a man named [[Simeon (Gospel of Luke)|Simeon]] says to Mary and Joseph that Jesus "shall stand as a sign of contradiction, while a sword will pierce your own soul. Then the secret thoughts of many will come to light" ([[s:Bible (American Standard)/Luke#2:35|Luke 2:28–35]]). Several years later, when Jesus goes missing on a visit to [[Jerusalem]], his parents [[Finding in the Temple|find him in the temple]] sitting among the teachers, listening to them and asking questions, and the people are amazed at his understanding and answers; Mary scolds Jesus for going missing, to which Jesus replies that he must "be in his father's house" ({{bibleref2|Luke|2:41–52}}).

Later, Jesus identifies John as "the Elijah who was to come" ({{bibleref2|Matthew|11:14}}, {{bibleref2|Mark|9:13–14}}), the prophet who was expected to arrive before the "great and terrible day of the Lord" ([[s:Bible (American Standard)/Malachi#4:5|Malachi 4:5]]). Likewise, Luke says that John had the spirit and power of [[Elijah]] ({{bibleref2| Luke |1:17}}).

In Mark, John baptizes Jesus, and as he comes out of the water he sees the [[Holy Spirit]] descending to him like a dove and he hears a voice from heaven declaring him to be God's Son ({{bibleref2|Mark|1:9–11}}). This is one of two events described in the gospels where a voice from Heaven calls Jesus "Son", the other being the [[Transfiguration of Jesus|Transfiguration]].{{sfn|Lee|2004|pp=21–30}}<ref name="Nobbs"/> The spirit then drives him into the wilderness where he is tempted by [[Satan]] ({{bibleref2| Mark |1:12–13}}). Jesus then begins his ministry after John's arrest ({{bibleref2|Mark|1:14}}). Jesus' baptism in Matthew is similar. Here, before Jesus' baptism, John protests, saying, "I need to be baptized by you" ({{bibleref2| Matthew |3:14}}). Jesus instructs him to carry on with the baptism "to fulfill all righteousness" ({{bibleref2| Matthew |3:15}}). Matthew also details the three temptations that Satan offers Jesus in the wilderness ({{bibleref2| Matthew |4:3–11}}). In Luke, the Holy Spirit descends as a dove after everyone has been baptized and Jesus is praying ({{bibleref2| Luke |3:21–22}}). John implicitly recognizes Jesus from prison after sending his followers to ask about him ({{bibleref2| Luke |7:18–23}}). Jesus' baptism and temptation serve as preparation for his public ministry.<ref>{{cite book|last=Sheen|first=Fulton J.|title=Life of Christ|year=2008|publisher=Random House|isbn=978-0-385-52699-9|page=65|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KyqQKohpVR4C&pg=PA65#v=onepage}}</ref>

The Gospel of John leaves out Jesus' baptism and temptation.{{sfn|Cross|Livingstone|2005|loc=Jesus Christ}} Here, John the Baptist testifies that he saw the Spirit descend on Jesus ({{bibleref2| John |1:32}}).<ref name="Zanzig"/>{{sfn|Boring|Craddock|2004|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=N0tLXRIiIe0C&lpg=PA292&pg=PA292#v=onepage&q=%22the%20baptist%22 292]}} John publicly proclaims Jesus as the sacrificial [[Lamb of God]], and some of John's followers become disciples of Jesus.{{sfn|Theissen|Merz|1998|pp=17–62}} In this Gospel, John denies that he is Elijah ({{bibleref2| John |1:21}}). Before John is imprisoned, Jesus leads his followers to baptize disciples as well ({{bibleref2| John |3:22–24}}), and they baptize more people than John ({{bibleref2| John |4:1}}).

John depicts Jesus' ministry as largely taking place in and around Jerusalem, rather than in Galilee; and Jesus' divine identity is openly proclaimed and immediately recognized.{{sfn|Harris|1985|pp=302–10}}

Scholars divide the ministry of Jesus into several stages. The Galilean ministry begins when Jesus returns to Galilee from the [[Judaean Desert]] after rebuffing the temptation of [[Satan]]. Jesus preaches around Galilee, and in [[s:Bible (American Standard)/Matthew#4:18|Matthew 4:18–20]], [[first disciples of Jesus|his first disciples]], who will eventually form the core of the early Church, encounter him and begin to travel with him.{{sfn|McGrath|2006|pp=16–22}}{{sfn|Redford|2007|pp=117–30}} This period includes the [[Sermon on the Mount]], one of Jesus' major discourses,{{sfn|Redford|2007|pp=117–30}}<ref>{{cite book|title=The Sermon on the mount: a theological investigation|first=Carl G.|last= Vaught|year=2001 |publisher=Baylor University Press |isbn =978-0-918954-76-3 |pages= xi–xiv}}</ref> as well as the [[calming the storm|calming of the storm]], the [[feeding the multitude|feeding of the 5,000]], [[Jesus walking on water|walking on water]] and a number of other miracles and [[parables of Jesus|parables]].{{sfn|Redford|2007|pp=143–60}} It ends with the [[Confession of Peter]] and the Transfiguration.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia | title=Transfiguration, The | encyclopedia=The New Schaff-Herzog Encyclopedia of Religious Thought: Son of Man-Tremellius V11 |isbn= 978-1-4286-3189-2 | publisher=Funk & Wagnalls Company | year=1909 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=js5-eDk13TcC&pg=PA493#v=onepage | page=493 | last=Nash | first=Henry S. | editor-first=Samuel M. | editor-last=Jackson}}</ref><ref name="Barton132">{{cite book|title=The Cambridge Companion to the Gospels|first=Stephen C.|last= Barton |isbn= 978-0-521-80766-1 |pages= 132–33 |publisher=Cambridge University Press|date=2006-11-23}}</ref>

As Jesus travels towards Jerusalem, in the [[Perea]]n ministry, he returns to the area where he was baptized, about a third of the way down from the [[Sea of Galilee]] along the [[Jordan River]] ([[s:Bible (American Standard)/John#10:40|John 10:40–42]]).{{sfn|Cox|Easley|2007|p=137}}{{sfn|Redford|2007| pp= 211–29}} The [[Ministry of Jesus#Final ministry in Jerusalem|final ministry in Jerusalem]] begins with Jesus' [[triumphal entry into Jerusalem|triumphal entry]] into the city on [[Palm Sunday]].{{sfn|Cox|Easley|2007|pp=155–70}} In the Synoptic Gospels, during that week Jesus [[Cleansing of the Temple|drives the money changers]] from the [[Second Temple]] and [[Bargain of Judas|Judas bargains to betray]] him.

==== Disciples and followers ====
[[File:Brooklyn Museum - The Exhortation to the Apostles (Recommandation aux apôtres) - James Tissot.jpg|thumb|right|Jesus talking to his 12 disciples, as depicted by James Tissot]]
Near the beginning of his ministry, Jesus [[Commissioning of the Twelve Apostles|appoints twelve apostles]]. In Matthew and Mark, despite Jesus only briefly requesting that they join him, Jesus' first four apostles, who were fishermen, are described as immediately consenting, and abandoning their nets and boats to do so ([[s:Bible (American Standard)/Matthew#4:18|Matthew 4:18–22]], [[s:Bible (American Standard)/Mark#1:16|Mark 1:16–20]]). In John, Jesus' first two apostles were disciples of John the Baptist. The Baptist sees Jesus and calls him the [[Lamb of God]]; the two hear this and follow Jesus.{{sfn|Brown|1988|pp= 25–27}}{{sfn|Boring|Craddock|2004|pages= 292–93}} In addition to the Twelve Apostles, the opening of the passage of the [[Sermon on the Plain]] identifies a much larger group of people as disciples ([[s:Bible (American Standard)/Luke#6:17|Luke 6:17]]). Also, in [[s:Bible (American Standard)/Luke#10:1|Luke 10:1–16]] Jesus sends [[Seventy disciples|seventy or seventy-two of his followers]] in pairs to prepare towns for his prospective visit. They are instructed to accept hospitality, heal the sick and spread the word that the [[Kingship and kingdom of God|Kingdom of God]] is coming.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia | title=The Gospel According to Luke | encyclopedia=New Collegeville Bible Commentary: New Testament | publisher=Liturgical Press | year=2009 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sdooTRyPMCwC&pg=PA255#v=onepage | page=255 | first=Michael F. | last=Patella | editor-first=Daniel | editor-last=Durken | isbn=978-0-8146-3260-4}}</ref>

In Mark, the disciples are notably obtuse. They fail to understand Jesus' miracles ({{bibleref2|Mark|4:35–41}}, {{bibleref2|Mark|6:52}}), his parables ({{bibleref2|Mark|4:13}}), or what "rising from the dead" would mean ({{bibleref2|Mark|9:9–10}}). When Jesus is later arrested, they desert him.{{sfn|Harris|1985|pp=285–96}}

In the Synoptics, Jesus teaches extensively, often in [[parable]]s,{{sfn|Theissen|Merz|1998|pp=316–46}} about the Kingdom of God (or, in Matthew, the [[Kingdom of Heaven (Gospel of Matthew)|Kingdom of Heaven]]). The Kingdom is described as both imminent ([[s:Bible (American Standard)/Mark#1:15|Mark 1:15]]) and already present in the ministry of Jesus ({{bibleref2|Luke|17:21}}). Jesus promises inclusion in the Kingdom for those who accept his message ({{bibleref2|Mark|10:13–27}}). Jesus talks of the "[[Son of man|Son of Man]]," an [[Apocalypse|apocalyptic]] figure who would come to gather the chosen.<ref name="Britannica"/>

And a second is like it: 'You shall love your neighbor as yourself" ([[s:Bible (American Standard)/Matthew#22:37|Matthew 22:37–39]]). Other ethical teachings of Jesus include [[Matthew 5:44|loving your enemies]], refraining from hatred and lust, [[turning the other cheek]], and forgiving people who have sinned against you ([[Sermon on the Mount|Matthew 5–7]]).<ref>{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LlMVrmA-b-4C&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage | title=Kingdom Ethics: Following Jesus in Contemporary Context | publisher=InterVarsity Press | year=2003 | pages=102–03, 138–40, 197–98, 295–98| isbn=978-0-8308-2668-1 | first1=Glen H. |last1=Stassen |first2= David P. |last2=Gushee}}</ref>

John's Gospel presents the teachings of Jesus not merely as his own preaching, but as divine [[revelation]]. John the Baptist, for example, states in [[s:Bible (American Standard)/John#3:34|John 3:34]]: "He whom God has sent speaks the words of God, for he gives the Spirit without measure." In [[s:Bible (American Standard)/John#7:16|John 7:16]] Jesus says, "My teaching is not mine but his who sent me." He asserts the same thing in [[s:Bible (American Standard)/John#14:10|John 14:10]]: "Do you not believe that I am in the Father and the Father is in me? The words that I say to you I do not speak on my own; but the Father who dwells in me does his works."<ref name="autogenerated98" /><ref>{{cite book|title=The missions of Jesus and the disciples according to the Fourth Gospel| first=Andreas J.|last= Köstenberger|year= 1998| isbn= 978-0-8028-4255-8 |publisher=Wm.

But the one who does not have will be deprived even more.", going on to say that the majority of their generation have grown "dull hearts" and thus are unable to understand ([[s:Bible (American Standard)/Matthew#13:10|Matthew 13:10–17]]).

In the gospel accounts, Jesus devotes a large portion of his ministry performing [[miracle]]s, especially healings.{{sfn|Green|McKnight |Marshall|1992|p=299}} The miracles can be classified into two main categories: healing miracles and nature miracles.{{sfn|Twelftree|1999|p=350}} The healing miracles include cures for physical ailments, [[exorcism]]s,{{sfn|Witherington|1997|p=113}}{{sfn|Theissen|Merz|1998|p=298}} and [[Resurrection of the dead|resurrections of the dead]].{{sfn|Green|McKnight|Marshall|1992|p=300}} The nature miracles show Jesus' power over nature, and include [[turning water into wine]], walking on water, and calming a storm, among others. Jesus states that his miracles are from a divine source. When Jesus' opponents suddenly accuse him of performing exorcisms by the power of [[Beelzebul]], the prince of demons, Jesus counters that he performs them by the "Spirit of God" ([[s:Bible (American Standard)/Matthew#12:28|Matthew 12:28]]) or "finger of God", arguing that all logic suggests that Satan would not let his demons assist the Children of God because it would divide Satan's house and bring his kingdom to desolation; furthermore, he asks his opponents that if he exorcises by [[Beelzebub|Beel'zebub]], "by whom do your sons cast them out?"([[s:Bible (American Standard)/Luke#11:20|Luke 11:20]]).<ref name="Britannica2">{{cite encyclopedia|title=Jesus Christ|encyclopedia=Encyclopædia Britannica|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/303091/Jesus-Christ|accessdate=June 10, 2015|first1=Ed P.|last1=Sanders|first2=Jaroslav J.|last2=Pelikan}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Js9nFESO0VAC&pg=PA100#v=onepage|title=Zondervan King James Version Commentary: New Testament|last2=Mitchell|first2=Daniel R.|publisher=Zondervan|year=2010|isbn=978-0-310-25150-7|page=100|first1=Edward E.|last1=Hindson}}</ref> In [[s:Bible (American Standard)/Matthew#12:28|Matthew 12:31–32]], he goes on to say that while all manner of sin, "even insults against God" or "insults against the son of man", shall be forgiven, whoever insults goodness (or "The [[Holy Spirit]]") shall never be forgiven; he/she carries the guilt of his/her sin forever.

Jesus next expels the money changers from the [[Second Temple]], accusing them of turning it into a den of thieves through their commercial activities. Jesus then prophesies about the coming destruction, including false prophets, wars, earthquakes, celestial disorders, persecution of the faithful, the appearance of an "abomination of desolation," and unendurable tribulations ({{bibleref2|Mark|13:1–23}}). The mysterious "Son of Man," he says, will dispatch angels to gather the faithful from all parts of the earth ({{bibleref2|Mark|13:24–27}}).

During the trials Jesus speaks very little, mounts no defense, and gives very infrequent and indirect answers to the priests' questions, prompting an officer to slap him.

The Jewish elders take Jesus to [[Pilate's Court]] and ask the Roman governor, [[Pontius Pilate]], to judge and condemn Jesus for various allegations, accusing him of [[blasphemy]], perverting the nation, forbidding the payment of tribute, inciting [[sedition]] against [[Roman Empire|Rome]], [[witchcraft|sorcery]], claiming to be the King of the Jews, the Son of God, and a [[Messiah|savior]] to the world.<ref name=Holman608 /> The use of the word "king" is central to the discussion between Jesus and Pilate.

Jesus' crucifixion is described in all four canonical gospels. After the trials, Jesus is led to [[Calvary]] [[Christ Carrying the Cross|carrying his cross]]; the route traditionally thought to have been taken is known as the [[Via Dolorosa]]. The three Synoptic Gospels indicate that [[Simon of Cyrene]] assists him, having been compelled by the Romans to do so.{{sfn|Evans|2003|pp=509–20}}{{sfn|Köstenberger|Kellum|Quarles|2009|pp=211–14}} In [[s:Bible (American Standard)/Luke#23:27|Luke 23:27–28]] Jesus tells the women in the multitude of people following him not to weep for him but for themselves and their children.{{sfn|Evans|2003|pp=509–20}} At Calvary, Jesus is offered a concoction usually offered as a [[Analgesic|painkiller]]. According to Matthew and Mark, he refuses it.{{sfn|Evans|2003|pp=509–20}}{{sfn|Köstenberger|Kellum|Quarles|2009|pp=211–14}}

The soldiers then crucify Jesus and [[Sortes (ancient Rome)|cast lots]] for his clothes. Above Jesus' head on the cross is Pilate's inscription, "Jesus of Nazareth, the King of the Jews." Soldiers and passersby [[Mocking of Jesus|mock]] him about it. Two convicted thieves are crucified along with Jesus. In Matthew and Mark, both thieves mock Jesus. In Luke, [[Impenitent thief|one of them]] rebukes Jesus, while [[Penitent thief|the other]] defends him.{{sfn|Evans|2003|pp=509–20}}{{sfn|Doninger|1999|p=271}}<ref>{{cite book|last=Ehrman|first=Bart D.|title=Jesus, Interrupted: Revealing the Hidden Contradictions in the Bible (And Why We Don't Know About Them)|year=2009|publisher=HarperCollins|isbn=978-0-06-186328-8|page=82|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QDiT3ytZ8FEC&pg=PA82#v=onepage}}</ref> Jesus tells the latter: "today you will be with me in Paradise" (Luke 23:43). In John, Mary, the mother of Jesus, and the [[beloved disciple]] were at the crucifixion. Jesus tells the beloved disciple to take care of his mother (John 19:26–27).

The Roman soldiers break the two thieves' legs (a procedure designed to hasten death in a crucifixion), but they do not break those of Jesus, as he is already dead (John 19:33). In [[s:Bible (American Standard)/John 19:34|John 19:34]], [[Longinus|one soldier]] pierces Jesus' side with a [[Holy Lance|lance]], and [[Five Holy Wounds|blood and water]] flow out.{{sfn|Doninger|1999|p= 271}} In the Synoptics, when Jesus dies, the heavy curtain at the Temple is torn.

On the same day, [[Joseph of Arimathea]], with Pilate's permission and with [[Nicodemus]]' help, [[Descent from the Cross|removes Jesus' body from the cross]], wraps him in a clean cloth, and buries him in his new [[Sepulchre|rock-hewn tomb]].{{sfn|Evans|2003|pp=509–20}} In [[s:Bible (American Standard)/Matthew#27:62|Matthew 27:62–66]], on the following day the chief Jewish priests ask Pilate for the tomb to be secured, and with Pilate's permission the priests place seals on the large stone covering the entrance.{{sfn|Evans|2003|pp=509–20}}{{sfn|Morris|1992|page=727}}

* In Luke, Mary and various other women meet two angels at the tomb, but the eleven disciples do not believe their story (Luke 25:1–12). Jesus appears to two of his followers in Emmaus. He also makes an appearance to Peter. Jesus then appears that same day to his disciples in Jerusalem (Luke 24:13–43). Although he appears and vanishes mysteriously, he also eats and lets them touch him to prove that he is not a spirit. He repeats his command to bring his teaching to all nations ([[s:Bible (American Standard)/Luke#24:51|Luke 24:51]]).{{sfn|Harris|1985|pp=297–301}}
* In John, Mary is alone at first, but Peter and the beloved disciple come and see the tomb as well. Jesus then appears to Mary at the tomb.

In a second visit to disciples, he proves to a doubting disciple ("[[Doubting Thomas]]") that he is flesh and blood.{{sfn|Harris|1985|pp=302–10}} The disciples return to Galilee, where Jesus makes another appearance.

==Early Christianity==
{{Main article|Early Christianity}}
After Jesus's life, his followers, as described in the first chapters of the [[Acts of the Apostles]], were all [[Jews]] either by birth or [[conversion to Judaism|conversion]], for which the biblical term "[[proselyte]]" is used,<ref>[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12481c.htm Catholic Encyclopedia: Proselyte]: "The English term "proselyte" occurs only in the New Testament where it signifies a convert to the Jewish religion ({{bibleverse||Matthew|23:15|NAB}}; {{bibleverse||Acts|2:11|NAB}}; {{bibleverse-nb||Acts|6:5|NAB}}; etc.), though the same Greek word is commonly used in the [[Septuagint]] to designate a foreigner living in Palestine. Thus the term seems to have passed from an original local and chiefly political sense, in which it was used as early as 300 BC, to a technical and religious meaning in the Judaism of the [[Apostolic Age|New Testament epoch]]."</ref> and referred to by historians as [[Jewish Christian]]s.

Numerous quotations in the New Testament and other Christian writings of the first centuries, indicate that early Christians generally used and revered the [[Hebrew Bible]] (the [[Tanakh]]) as [[religious text]], mostly in the Greek ([[Septuagint]]) or Aramaic ([[Targum]]) translations.<ref>{{cite book|ref=harv|last1=Fee|first1=Gordon|authorlink1=Gordon Fee|last2=Stuart|first2=Douglas|authorlink2=Douglas Stuart (biblical scholar) |title=How to Read the Bible for All Its Worth: Fourth Edition|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sGBtAgAAQBAJ|year=2014|publisher=Zondervan|isbn=978-0-310-51783-2}}</ref>

Early Christians wrote many religious works, including the ones included in the [[canon of the New Testament]].  The canonical texts, which have become the main sources used by historians to try to understand the historical Jesus and sacred texts within Christianity, were probably written between 50 and 120 AD.<ref name="Ehrman120ce">{{cite book|author=Bart D.

Approaches to the historical reconstruction of the life of Jesus have varied from the "maximalist" approaches of the 19th century, in which the gospel accounts were accepted as reliable evidence wherever it is possible, to the "minimalist" approaches of the early 20th century, where hardly anything about Jesus was accepted as historical.<ref>{{cite book|title=The Historical Jesus of the Gospels|first= Craig S.|last= Keener |year= 2012 | isbn= 978-0-8028-6292-1 |publisher=William B.

=== Judea and Galilee in the 1st century ===
[[File:Palestine in the time of Jesus.jpg|thumb|[[Judea]], [[Galilee]] and neighboring areas at the time of Jesus|alt=A map. See description]]
In AD 6, [[Judea]], [[Edom|Idumea]], and [[Samaria]] were transformed from a [[Client state|client kingdom]] of the [[Roman Empire]] into an imperial province, also called [[Judea (Roman province)|Judea]]. A Roman [[prefect]], rather than a client king, ruled the land. The prefect ruled from [[Caesarea Maritima]], leaving [[Jerusalem]] to be run by the [[List of High Priests of Israel|High Priest of Israel]]. As an exception, the prefect came to Jerusalem during religious festivals, when religious and patriotic enthusiasm sometimes inspired unrest or uprisings. Gentile lands surrounded the Jewish territories of Judea and [[Galilee]], but Roman law and practice allowed Jews to remain separate legally and culturally. Galilee was evidently prosperous, and poverty was limited enough that it did not threaten the social order.<ref name=Britannica />

This was the era of [[Hellenistic Judaism]], which combined [[Judaism|Jewish religious tradition]] with elements of [[Hellenistic]] Greek culture. Until the [[fall of the Roman Empire]] and the [[Muslim conquests]] of the Eastern Mediterranean, the main centers of Hellenistic Judaism were [[Alexandria]] (Egypt) and [[Antioch]] (now Southern Turkey), the two main [[Greek colonies|Greek urban settlements]] of the [[MENA|Middle East and North Africa]] area, both founded at the end of the 4th century BCE in the wake of the conquests of [[Alexander the Great]]. Hellenistic Judaism also existed in [[Jerusalem during the Second Temple Period]], where there was conflict between [[Hellenization|Hellenizers]] and traditionalists (sometimes called [[Judaizers]]).  The [[Hebrew Bible]] was translated from [[Biblical Hebrew]] and [[Biblical Aramaic]] into [[Jewish Koiné Greek]]; the [[Targum]] translations into Aramaic were also generated during this era, both due to the decline of knowledge of Hebrew.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Barr|first1=James|editor1-last=Davies|editor1-first=W.D.|editor2-last=Finkelstein|editor2-first=Louis|title=The Cambridge history of Judaism.

Jews based their faith and religious practice on the [[Torah]], five books said to have been given by God to [[Moses]]. The three prominent religious parties were the [[Pharisees]], the [[Essenes]], and the [[Sadducees]]. Together these parties represented only a small fraction of the population. Most Jews looked forward to a time that God would deliver them from their pagan rulers, possibly through war against the Romans.<ref name=Britannica />

New Testament scholars face a formidable challenge when they analyze the canonical Gospels.{{sfn|Harris|1985|p=263}}
The Gospels are not biographies in the modern sense, and the authors explain Jesus' theological significance and recount his public ministry while omitting many details of his life.{{sfn|Harris|1985|p=263}}
The reports of supernatural events associated with Jesus' death and resurrection make the challenge even more difficult.{{sfn|Harris|1985|p=263}}
Scholars regard the gospels as compromised sources of information because the writers were trying to glorify Jesus.{{sfn|Sanders|1993|p=3}}
Even so, the sources for Jesus' life are better than sources scholars have for the life of [[Alexander the Great]].{{sfn|Sanders|1993|p=3}}
Scholars use a number of criteria, such as the [[criterion of multiple attestation|criterion of independent attestation]], the [[Biblical criticism#Coherence|criterion of coherence]], and the [[criterion of discontinuity]] to judge the historicity of events.{{sfn|Rausch|2003|pp=36–37}} The historicity of an event also depends on the reliability of the source; indeed, the gospels are not independent nor consistent records of Jesus' life. Mark, which is most likely the earliest written gospel, has been considered for many decades the most historically accurate.<ref>{{cite book|title=John, Jesus, and History, Volume 2|year=2007|publisher=Society of Biblical Lit|isbn=978-1-58983-293-0|page=291|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ryybidJYMAQC&pg=PA291#v=onepage |first1= Paul N.|last1= Anderson|first2= Felix |last2=Just |first3= Tom|last3= Thatcher}}</ref> John, the latest written gospel, differs considerably from the Synoptic Gospels, and thus is generally considered less reliable, although more and more scholars now also recognize that it may contain a core of older material as historically valuable as the Synoptic tradition or even more so.<ref>{{cite book|title=John, Jesus, and History, Volume 2|year=2007|publisher=Society of Biblical Lit|isbn=978-1-58983-293-0|page=292|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ryybidJYMAQC&pg=PA291#v=onepage |first1= Paul N.|last1= Anderson|first2= Felix |last2=Just |first3= Tom|last3= Thatcher}}</ref>

The non-canonical [[Gospel of Thomas]] might be an independent witness to many of Jesus' parables and aphorisms. For example, Thomas confirms that Jesus blessed the poor and that this saying circulated independently before being combined with similar sayings in the [[Q source]].{{sfn|Funk|Hoover|1993|pp=471–532}} Other select non-canonical Christian texts may also have value for historical Jesus research.{{sfn|Theissen|Merz|1998|pp=17–62}}

Early non-Christian sources that attest to the historical existence of Jesus include the works of the historians [[Josephus]] and [[Tacitus]].{{efn|Tuckett writes: "All this does at least render highly implausible any far-fetched theories that even Jesus' very existence was a Christian invention. The fact that Jesus existed, that he was crucified under Pontius Pilate (for whatever reason) and that he had a band of followers who continued to support his cause, seems to be part of the bedrock of historical tradition. If nothing else, the non-Christian evidence can provide us with certainty on that score."<ref>{{cite encyclopedia|editor-last=Bockmuehl |editor-first= Markus N.A. |title=Sources and methods |first=Christopher |last=Tuckett |year=2001|encyclopedia= Cambridge Companion to Jesus|publisher= Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-79678-1|pages=123–24}}</ref>}}{{sfn|Blomberg|2009|pp=431–36}}{{sfn|Van Voorst|2000|pp=39–53}} Josephus scholar [[Louis Feldman]] has stated that "few have doubted the genuineness" of Josephus' reference to Jesus in [[s:The Antiquities of the Jews/Book XX#Chapter 9|book 20]] of the ''[[Antiquities of the Jews]]'', and it is disputed only by a small number of scholars.{{sfn|Van Voorst|2000| p= 83}}<ref>{{cite book |last= Maier|first= Paul L.|year=1995|title= Josephus, the essential works: a condensation of Jewish antiquities and The Jewish war| isbn= 978-0-8254-3260-6 |page= 285 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=c2Tu1Yp3n0EC&pg=PA285#v=onepage}}</ref> Tacitus referred to Christ and his execution by Pilate in [[s:The Annals (Tacitus)/Book 15#44|book 15]] of his work ''[[Annals (Tacitus)|Annals]]''.

Non-Christian sources are valuable in two ways. First, they show that even neutral or hostile parties never evince any doubt that Jesus actually existed. Second, they present a rough picture of Jesus that is compatible with that found in the Christian sources: that Jesus was a teacher, had a reputation as a miracle worker, had a brother James, and died a violent death.{{sfn|Theissen|Merz|1998}}

Archeology helps scholars better understand Jesus' social world.{{sfn|Reed|2002|p=18}} Recent archeological work, for example, indicates that [[Capernaum]], a city important in Jesus' ministry, was poor and small, without even a [[Forum (Roman)|forum]] or an [[agora]].<ref name="Gowler">{{cite book |title=What are they saying about the historical Jesus?|first=David B. |last=Gowler |year=2007| isbn= 978-0-8091-4445-7|publisher=Paulist Press| page= 102}}</ref><ref>{{cite encyclopedia|encyclopedia=Jesus and archaeology |editor-first= James H.|editor-last= Charlesworth |year=2006 |isbn= 978-0-8028-4880-2 |page= 127 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QoIS7VApH6cC&pg=PA127#v=onepage |publisher=Wm.

The gospels offer several clues concerning the year of Jesus' birth. [[s:Bible (American Standard)/Matthew#2:1|Matthew 2:1]] associates the birth of Jesus with the reign of [[Herod the Great]], who died around 4 BC, and [[s:Bible (American Standard)/Luke#1:5|Luke 1:5]] mentions that Herod was on the throne shortly before the birth of Jesus,{{sfn|Maier|1989|pp=115–18}}{{sfn|Niswonger|1992|pp=121–22}} although this gospel also associates the birth with the [[Census of Quirinius]] which took place ten years later.{{sfn|Köstenberger|Kellum|Quarles|2009|pp=137–38}}{{sfn|Niswonger|1992|pp=122–24}} [[s:Bible (American Standard)/Luke#3:23|Luke 3:23]] states that Jesus was "about thirty years old" at the start of his [[ministry of Jesus|ministry]], which according to [[s:Bible (American Standard)/Acts#10:37|Acts 10:37–38]] was preceded by John the Baptist's ministry, itself recorded in [[s:Bible (American Standard)/Luke#3:1|Luke 3:1–2]] to have begun in the 15th year of [[Tiberius]]' reign (28 or 29 AD).{{sfn|Niswonger|1992|pp=121–22}}<ref name="Vermes2006">{{cite book | first = Géza | last = Vermes | title = The Nativity: History and Legend | publisher = Random House Digital | year = 2010|pages=81–82 |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=a9EiEU_Yz_kC&pg=PA81#v=onepage |isbn=978-0-307-49918-9}}</ref> By collating the gospel accounts with historical data and using various other methods, most scholars arrive at a date of birth from 6 to 4 BC for Jesus,<ref name="Vermes2006"/>{{sfn|Dunn|2003|p=324}} but some propose estimates that lie in a wider range.{{efn|For example, John P.

The years of Jesus' ministry have been estimated using several different approaches.{{sfn|Köstenberger |Kellum|Quarles|2009|p=140}}{{sfn|Freedman|2000|p=249}} One of these applies the reference in [[s:Bible (American Standard)/Luke#3:1|Luke 3:1–2]], [[s:Bible (American Standard)/Acts#10:37|Acts 10:37–38]] and the dates of Tiberius' reign, which are well known, to give a date of around 28–29 AD for the start of Jesus' ministry.{{sfn|Maier|1989|pp=120–21}} Another approach uses the statement about the temple in [[s:Bible (American Standard)/John#2:13|John 2:13–20]], which asserts that the [[Second Temple|temple in Jerusalem]] was in its 46th year of construction at the start of Jesus' ministry, together with [[s:The Antiquities of the Jews/Book XV|Josephus' statement]] that the temple's reconstruction was started by Herod the Great in the 18th year of his reign, to estimate a date around 27–29 AD.{{sfn|Köstenberger|Kellum|Quarles|2009|p=140}}{{sfn|Maier|1989|p=123}} A further method uses the date of the [[Beheading of St. John the Baptist|death of John the Baptist]] and the marriage of [[Herod Antipas]] to [[Herodias]], based on the writings of Josephus, and correlates it with [[s:Bible (American Standard)/Matthew#14:4|Matthew 14:4]] and [[s:Bible (American Standard)/Mark#6:18|Mark 6:18]].<ref>{{cite encyclopedia|first=Craig |last=Evans|year= 2006| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wMbEyeDSQQgC&pg=PA55#v=onepage |title=Josephus on John the Baptist| encyclopedia=The Historical Jesus in Context |editor-last1=Levine|editor-last2=Allison|editor-first3=John D.|editor-last3=Crossan|publisher=Princeton University Press| isbn= 978-0-691-00992-6 |pages=55–58| editor-first=Amy-Jill| editor2-first=Dale C.}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|title=Herodias: at home in that fox's den|first= Florence M.|last= Gillman |year=2003| isbn= 978-0-8146-5108-7| pages=25–30 |publisher= Liturgical Press}}</ref> Given that most scholars date the marriage of Herod and Herodias as AD 28–35, this yields a date about 28–29 AD.{{sfn|Freedman|2000|p=249}}

A number of approaches have been used to estimate the year of the crucifixion of Jesus. Most scholars agree that he died in 30 or 33 AD.<ref name=Humphreys1992/>{{sfn|Köstenberger|Kellum|Quarles|2009|p=398}} The gospels state that the event occurred during the prefecture of Pilate, the Roman governor of Judea from 26 to 36 AD.{{sfn|Theissen|Merz|1998|pp=81–83}}<ref>{{cite book|last=Green |first=Joel B. |title=The gospel of Luke: New International Commentary on the New Testament Series |year= 1997 |publisher=Wm.

====Family====
{{see also|Brothers of Jesus}}
Many scholars agree that Joseph, Jesus' father, died by the time Jesus began his ministry. Joseph is not mentioned at all in the gospels during Jesus' ministry. Joseph's death would explain why in Mark 6:3, Jesus' neighbors refer to Jesus as the "son of Mary" (sons were usually identified by their fathers).<ref>{{cite book|last1=Brown|first1=Raymond E.|title=Mary in the New Testament|date=1978|publisher=Paulist Press|page=64|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ML1mnUBwmhcC&pg=PA64#v=onepage|isbn=978-0809121687}}</ref>

According to Theissen and Merz, it is common for extraordinary [[Charismatic authority|charismatic leaders]], such as Jesus, to come into conflict with their ordinary families.{{sfn|Theissen|Merz|1998|p=194}} In Mark, Jesus' family comes to get him, fearing that he is mad (Mark 3:20–34), and this account is likely historical because early Christians would not have invented it.<ref name="ActJMark">[[Robert W.

Géza Vermes says that the doctrine of the [[virgin birth of Jesus]] arose from theological development rather than from historical events.{{sfn|Vermes|1981|p=283}}
Despite the widely held view that the authors of the Synoptic Gospels drew upon each other (the so-called [[synoptic problem]]), other scholars take it as significant that the virgin birth is [[criterion of multiple attestation|attested]] by two separate gospels, Matthew and Luke.<ref>Bromiley, Geoffrey (1995) ''International Standard Bible Encyclopedia'', Eerdmans Publishing, {{ISBN|978-0-8028-3784-4}}, p. 991.</ref><ref>Craig S.

According to E. P. Sanders, the [[Nativity of Jesus|birth narratives]] in Matthew and Luke are the clearest case of invention in the Gospel narratives of Jesus' life. Both accounts have Jesus born in [[Bethlehem]], in accordance with Jewish salvation history, and both have him growing up in Nazareth. But Sanders points that the two Gospels report completely different and irreconcilable explanations for how that happened. Luke's account of a census in which everyone returned to their ancestral cities is not plausible. Matthew's account is more plausible, but the story reads as though it was invented to identify Jesus as like a new [[Moses]], and the historian [[Josephus]] reports Herod the Great's brutality without ever mentioning that [[Massacre of the Innocents|he massacred little boys]].{{sfn|Sanders|1993|pp=85–88}}

Sanders says that the genealogies of Jesus are based not on historical information but on the authors' desire to show that Jesus was the universal Jewish savior.{{sfn|Sanders|1993|pp=80–91}} In any event, once the doctrine of the virgin birth of Jesus became established, that tradition superseded the earlier tradition that he was descended from [[David]] through Joseph.{{sfn|Theissen|Merz|1998|p=196}} Luke reports that Jesus was a [[Consanguinity|blood relation]] of [[John the Baptist]], but scholars generally consider this connection to be invented.{{sfn|Sanders|1993|pp=80–91}}<ref name="ActJBirth">[[Robert W. Funk|Funk, Robert W.]] and the [[Jesus Seminar]]. ''The acts of Jesus: the search for the authentic deeds of Jesus.'' HarperSanFrancisco. 1998. "Birth & Infancy Stories" pp. 497–526.</ref>

====Baptism====
Most modern scholars consider Jesus' baptism to be a definite historical fact, along with his crucifixion.{{sfn|Dunn|2003|p=339}} Theologian [[James Dunn (theologian)|James D. G. Dunn]] states that they "command almost universal assent" and "rank so high on the 'almost impossible to doubt or deny' scale of historical facts" that they are often the starting points for the study of the historical Jesus.{{sfn|Dunn|2003|p=339}} Scholars adduce the [[criterion of embarrassment]], saying that early Christians would not have invented a baptism that might imply that Jesus committed [[sin]]s and wanted to [[Repentance|repent]].{{sfn|Powell|1998|p=47}}<ref>{{cite book|last=Murphy|first=Catherine|title=John the Baptist: Prophet of Purity for a New Age|year=2003|publisher=Liturgical Press|isbn=978-0-8146-5933-5|pages=29–30|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=so_G78SBXAoC&pg=PA29#v=onepage}}</ref> According to Theissen and Merz, Jesus was inspired by [[John the Baptist]] and took over from him many elements of his teaching.{{sfn|Theissen|Merz|1998|p=235}}

According to Ehrman, Jesus taught that a coming kingdom was everyone's proper focus, not anything in this life.{{sfn|Ehrman|1999|pp=167–70}} He taught about the Jewish Law, seeking its true meaning, sometimes in opposition to other traditions.{{sfn|Ehrman|1999|pp=164–67}} Jesus put love at the center of the Law, and following that Law was an apocalyptic necessity.{{sfn|Ehrman|1999|pp=164–67}} His ethical teachings called for forgiveness, not judging others, loving enemies, and caring for the poor.{{sfn|Ehrman|1999|pp=171–76}} Funk and Hoover note that typical of Jesus were [[paradox]]ical or surprising turns of phrase, such as advising one, when struck on the cheek, [[Turning the other cheek|to offer the other cheek]] to be struck as well (Luke 6:29).<ref>[[Robert W. Funk|Funk, Robert W.]], Roy W. Hoover, and the [[Jesus Seminar]]. ''The five gospels.'' HarperSanFrancisco. 1993. p. 294</ref>

The Gospels portray Jesus teaching in well-defined sessions, such as the [[Sermon on the Mount]] in the Gospel of Matthew or the parallel [[Sermon on the Plain]] in Luke. According to Gerd Theissen and Annette Merz, these teaching sessions include authentic teachings of Jesus, but the scenes were invented by the respective evangelists to frame these teachings, which had originally been recorded without context.{{sfn|Theissen|Merz|1998|pp=17–62}} While Jesus' [[miracle]]s fit within the social context of [[Ancient history|antiquity]], he defined them differently. First, he attributed them to the faith of those healed. Second, he connected them to [[end time]]s prophecy.{{sfn|Theissen|Merz|1998|p=310}}

Jesus chose [[Apostle (Christian)|twelve disciples]] {{sfn|Sanders|1993|p=10}} (the "Twelve"), evidently as an [[Apocalypticism|apocalyptic]] message.{{sfn|Ehrman|1999|pp=186–87}} All three Synoptics mention the Twelve, although the names on Luke's list vary from those in Mark and Matthew, suggesting that Christians were not certain who all the disciples were.{{sfn|Ehrman|1999|pp=186–87}} The 12 disciples might have represented the twelve original [[Twelve Tribes of Israel|tribes of Israel]], which would be restored once God's rule was instituted.{{sfn|Ehrman|1999|pp=186–87}} The disciples were reportedly meant to be the rulers of the tribes in the coming Kingdom (Matthew 19:28, Luke 22:30).{{sfn|Ehrman|1999|pp=186–87}} According to Bart Ehrman, Jesus' promise that the Twelve would rule is historical, because the Twelve included [[Judas Iscariot]]. In Ehrman's view, no Christians would have invented a line from Jesus, promising rulership to the disciple who betrayed him.{{sfn|Ehrman|1999|pp=186–87}}
In Mark, the disciples play hardly any role other than a negative one. While others sometimes respond to Jesus with complete faith, his disciples are puzzled and doubtful.{{sfn|Sanders|1993|pp=123–24}} They serve as a [[Foil (literature)|foil]] to Jesus and to other characters.{{sfn|Sanders|1993|pp=123–24}} The failings of the disciples are probably exaggerated in Mark, and the disciples make a better showing in Matthew and Luke.{{sfn|Sanders|1993|pp=123–24}}

Sanders says that Jesus' mission was not about [[repentance]], although he acknowledges that this opinion is unpopular. He argues that repentance appears as a strong theme only in Luke, that repentance was [[John the Baptist]]'s message, and that Jesus' ministry would not have been scandalous if the sinners he ate with had been repentant.{{sfn|Sanders|1993|pp=230–36}} According to Theissen and Merz, Jesus taught that God was generously giving people an opportunity to repent.{{sfn|Theissen|Merz|1998|p=336}}

====Role====
Jesus taught that an apocalyptic figure, the "[[Son of man (Christianity)|Son of Man]]", would soon come on clouds of glory to gather the elect, or chosen ones (Mark 13:24–27, Matthew 24:29–31, Luke 21:25–28). He referred to himself as a "[[son of man]]" in the colloquial sense of "a person", but scholars do not know whether he also meant himself when he referred to the heavenly "Son of Man". [[Paul the Apostle]] and other early Christians interpreted the "Son of Man" as the risen Jesus.<ref name="Britannica" />

The title [[Christ (title)|Christ]], or [[Messiah]], indicates that Jesus' followers believed him to be the anointed heir of King [[David]], whom some Jews expected to save Israel. The Gospels refer to him not only as a Messiah but in the absolute form as "the Messiah" or, equivalently, "the Christ". In early Judaism, this absolute form of the title is not found, but only phrases such as "his Messiah". The tradition is ambiguous enough to leave room for debate as to whether Jesus defined his [[Eschatology|eschatological]] role as that of the Messiah.{{sfn|Cross|Livingstone|2005|loc=Messiah}} The Jewish messianic tradition included many different forms, some of them focused on a Messiah figure and others not.{{sfn|Theissen|Merz|1998|pp=533–40}} Based on the Christian tradition, [[Gerd Theissen]] advances the hypothesis that Jesus saw himself in messianic terms but did not claim the title "Messiah".{{sfn|Theissen|Merz|1998|pp=533–40}} Bart Ehrman argues that Jesus did consider himself to be the Messiah, albeit in the sense that he would be the king of the new political order that God would usher in,<ref>{{cite web|last=Ehrman|first= Bart|url= http://ehrmanblog.org/judas-and-the-messianic-secret/ |title=Judas and the Messianic Secret|website= The Bart Ehrman Blog|date=December 1, 2015}}</ref> not in the sense that most people today think of the term.<ref>{{cite web|last=Ehrman|first= Bart|url= http://ehrmanblog.org/jesus-claim-to-be-the-messiah/ |title=Jesus' Claim to be the Messiah|website= The Bart Ehrman Blog|date=December 1, 2015}}</ref>

====Passover and crucifixion in Jerusalem====
Around AD 30, Jesus and his followers traveled from [[Galilee]] to [[Jerusalem]] to observe [[Passover]].{{sfn|Sanders|1993|p=10}} Jesus caused a disturbance in the [[Second Temple]],{{sfn|Sanders|1993|p=11}} which was the center of Jewish religious and civil authority. Sanders associates it with Jesus' prophecy that the Temple would be totally demolished.{{sfn|Sanders|1993|pp=254–62}} Jesus had a last meal with his disciples, which is the origin of the Christian sacrament of bread and wine. Jesus' words are recorded in the Synoptics and in Paul's [[First Epistle to the Corinthians]]. The differences in the accounts cannot be completely reconciled, and it is impossible to know what Jesus intended, but in general the meal seems to point forward to the coming Kingdom. Jesus probably expected to be killed, and he may have hoped that God would intervene.{{sfn|Sanders|1993|pp=263–64}}

The Gospels say that Jesus was betrayed to the authorities by a disciple, and many scholars consider this report to be highly reliable.{{sfn|Cross|Livingstone|2005|loc=Jesus Christ}} He was executed on the orders of [[Pontius Pilate]], the Roman [[prefect]] of [[Judea (Roman province)|Judaea]].{{sfn|Sanders|1993|p=11}} Pilate most likely saw Jesus' reference to the Kingdom of God as a threat to Roman authority and worked with the Temple elites to have Jesus executed.{{sfn|Theissen|Merz|1998|pp=465–66}} The Sadducean high-priestly leaders of the Temple more plausibly had Jesus executed for political reasons than for his teaching.{{sfn|Cross|Livingstone|2005|loc=Jesus Christ}} They may have regarded him as a threat to stability, especially after he caused a disturbance at the Second Temple.{{sfn|Cross|Livingstone|2005|loc=Jesus Christ}}<ref name="JE1906"/> Other factors, such as Jesus' triumphal entry into Jerusalem, may have contributed to this decision.{{sfn|Sanders|1993|pp=269–73}} Most scholars consider Jesus' crucifixion to be factual, because early Christians would not have invented the painful death of their leader.{{sfn|Dunn|2003|p=339}}{{sfn|Meier|2006|pp=126–28}}

====After crucifixion====
[[File:The Resurrection Beaufort arms in border (f. 131) Cropped.jpg|thumb|upright|The Resurrection of Christ from a 16th-century manuscript of ''La Passion de Nostre Seigneur'']]
After Jesus' death, his followers said he rose from the dead, although exact details of their experiences are unclear. According to Sanders, the Gospel reports contradict each other, which, according to him, suggests competition among those claiming to have seen him first rather than deliberate fraud.{{sfn|Sanders|1993|pp=276–81}} On the other hand, [[L. Michael White]] suggests that inconsistencies in the Gospels reflect differences in the agendas of their unknown authors.<ref name=White/> The followers of Jesus formed a community to wait for his return and the founding of his kingdom.{{sfn|Sanders|1993|p=11}}

Modern research on the historical Jesus has not led to a unified picture of the historical figure, partly because of the variety of academic traditions represented by the scholars.{{sfn|Theissen|Winter|2002|pp=4–5}} Given the scarcity of historical sources, it is generally difficult for any scholar to construct a portrait of Jesus that can be considered historically valid beyond the basic elements of his life.{{sfn|Köstenberger|Kellum|Quarles|2009|pp=117–25}}{{sfn|Ehrman|1999|pp=22–23}} The portraits of Jesus constructed in these quests often differ from each other, and from the image portrayed in the gospels.{{sfn|Theissen|Winter|2002|p=5}}{{sfn|Cross|Livingstone|2005|loc=Historical Jesus, Quest of the}}

Jesus is seen as the founder of, in the words of Sanders, a '"renewal movement within Judaism." One of the criteria used to discern historical details in the "third quest" is the criterion of plausibility, relative to Jesus' Jewish context and to his influence on Christianity. A disagreement in contemporary research is whether Jesus was [[Apocalypticism|apocalyptic]]. Most scholars conclude that he was an apocalyptic preacher, like [[John the Baptist]] and [[Paul the Apostle]]. In contrast, certain prominent North American scholars, such as [[Burton Mack]] and John Dominic Crossan, advocate for a non-eschatological Jesus, one who is more of a [[Cynicism (philosophy)|Cynic]] [[Sage (philosophy)|sage]] than an apocalyptic preacher.{{sfn|Theissen|Merz|1998|pp=1–15}} In addition to portraying Jesus as an apocalyptic prophet, a charismatic healer or a [[Cynicism (philosophy)|cynic philosopher]], some scholars portray him as the true Messiah or an [[Egalitarianism|egalitarian]] prophet of [[social change]].<ref name="CambHist23">{{cite book|title=The Cambridge History of Christianity| volume= 1 |first1= Margaret M.|last1= Mitchell |first2= Frances M. |last2=Young |year= 2006| isbn= 978-0-521-81239-9|publisher=Cambridge University Press| page= 23 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6UTfmw_zStsC&pg=PA23#v=onepage }}</ref>{{sfn|Köstenberger|Kellum|Quarles|2009|pp=124–25}} However, the attributes described in the portraits sometimes overlap, and scholars who differ on some attributes sometimes agree on others.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia | title=Why Study the Historical Jesus? | encyclopedia=Handbook for the Study of the Historical Jesus | publisher=Brill | year=2011 | first=Colin | last=Brown | page=1416 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LuKMmVu0tpMC&pg=PA1416#v=onepage | isbn=978-90-04-16372-0 | editor1-first=Tom | editor1-last=Holmen | editor2-first=Stanley E. | editor2-last=Porter }}</ref>

Since the 18th century, scholars have occasionally put forth that Jesus was a political national messiah, but the evidence for this portrait is negligible. Likewise, the proposal that Jesus was a [[Zealots (Judea)|Zealot]] does not fit with the earliest strata of the Synoptic tradition.{{sfn|Cross|Livingstone|2005|loc=Jesus Christ}}

=== Christ myth theory ===
{{Main|Christ myth theory}}
The [[Christ myth theory]] is the hypothesis that Jesus of Nazareth never existed; or if he did, that he had virtually nothing to do with the founding of Christianity and the accounts in the [[gospels]].{{efn|Ehrman writes: ""In simpler terms, the historical Jesus did not exist. Or if he did, he had virtually nothing to do with the founding of Christianity." further quoting as authoritative the fuller definition provided by [[Earl Doherty]] in ''Jesus: Neither God Nor Man.'' Age of Reason, 2009, pp. vii–viii: it is "the theory that no historical Jesus worthy of the name existed, that Christianity began with a belief in a spiritual, mythical figure, that the Gospels are essentially allegory and fiction, and that no single identifiable person lay at the root of the Galilean preaching tradition."<ref>[[Bart Ehrman]], ''Did Jesus Exist?'' Harper Collins, 2012, p. 12</ref>}} Stories of Jesus' birth, along with other key events, have so many mythic elements that some scholars have suggested that Jesus himself was a [[myth]].{{sfn|Theissen|Merz|1998|pp=113–15}}
[[Bruno Bauer]] (1809–1882) taught that the first Gospel was a work of literature that produced history rather than described it.{{sfn|Theissen|Merz|1998|p=90}}
According to [[Albert Kalthoff]] (1850–1906) a social movement produced Jesus when it encountered Jewish messianic expectations.{{sfn|Theissen|Merz|1998|p=90}}
[[Arthur Drews]] (1865–1935) saw Jesus as the concrete form of a myth that predated Christianity.{{sfn|Theissen|Merz|1998|p=90}}

{{Main|Religious perspectives on Jesus}}
Apart from his own disciples and followers, the Jews of Jesus' day generally rejected him as the Messiah, as do the great majority of Jews today.

<!-- The info from here should probably be cited.
The depiction of Jesus in art took several centuries to reach a conventional standardized form for his physical appearance, which has subsequently remained largely stable since that time. Most images of Jesus have in common a number of traits which are now almost universally associated with Jesus, although variants are seen.

The image of a fully bearded Jesus with long hair did not become established until the 6th century in [[Eastern Christianity]], and much later in the West. Earlier images were much more varied. Images of Jesus tend to show ethnic characteristics similar to those of the culture in which the image has been created. Beliefs that certain images are historically authentic, or have acquired an authoritative status from Church tradition, remain powerful among some of the faithful, in Eastern Orthodoxy, Anglicanism, and Roman Catholicism. The [[Shroud of Turin]] is now the best-known example, although the [[Image of Edessa]] and the [[Veil of Veronica]] were better known in medieval times.!-->

Before the Protestant Reformation, the [[crucifix]] was common in Western Christianity. It is a model of the cross with Jesus crucified on it.

Jesus appears as an infant in a manger (feed trough) in Christmas creches, which depict the [[Nativity scene]].<ref name="EB16032015"/> He is typically joined by Mary, Joseph, animals, shepherds, angels, and the [[Biblical Magi|Magi]].<ref name="EB16032015"/> [[Francis of Assisi]] (1181/82–1226) is credited with popularizing the creche, although he probably did not initiate it.<ref name="EB16032015"/> The creche reached its height of popularity in the 17th and 18th centuries in southern Europe.<ref name="EB16032015">"Creche."

The total destruction that ensued with the [[Siege of Jerusalem (70)|siege of Jerusalem]] by the Romans in AD 70 made the survival of items from 1st-century Judea very rare and almost no direct records survive about the history of Judaism from the last part of the 1st century through the 2nd century.{{sfn|Levine|2006|pp=24–25}}<ref name="Koester382">[[Helmut Koester]] ''Introduction to the New Testament'', Vol. 1: History, Culture, and Religion of the Hellenistic Age.

However, throughout the history of Christianity a number of [[relic]]s attributed to Jesus have been claimed, although doubt has been cast on them. The 16th-century Catholic theologian [[Erasmus]] wrote sarcastically about the proliferation of relics and the number of buildings that could have been constructed from the wood claimed to be from the [[True Cross|cross used in the Crucifixion]].{{sfn|Dillenberger|1999|p=5}} Similarly, while experts debate whether Jesus was crucified with three nails or with four, at least thirty [[holy nail]]s continue to be venerated as relics across Europe.<ref>{{CathEncy|wstitle =Holy Nails|title=Holy Nails|first= Herbert|last=Thurston}}</ref>
