{{US Revolutionary War}}
The '''Continental Army''' was formed by the [[Second Continental Congress]] after the outbreak of the [[American Revolutionary War]] by the ex-British colonies that became the [[United States|United States of America]]. Established by a resolution of the Congress on June 14, 1775, it was created to coordinate the military efforts of the [[Thirteen Colonies]] in their revolt against the rule of [[Kingdom of Great Britain|Great Britain]]. The Continental Army was supplemented by local [[militia (United States)|militias]] and volunteer troops that remained under control of the individual states or were otherwise independent. General [[George Washington]] was the commander-in-chief of the army throughout the war.

Most of the Continental Army was disbanded in 1783 after the [[Treaty of Paris (1783)|Treaty of Paris]] ended the war. The 1st and 2nd Regiments went on to form the nucleus of the [[Legion of the United States]] in 1792 under General [[Anthony Wayne]]. This became the foundation of the [[United States Army]] in 1796.

==Origins==
The Continental Army consisted of soldiers from all 13 colonies and, after 1776, from all 13 states. When the American Revolutionary War began at the [[Battles of Lexington and Concord]] on April 19, 1775, the colonial revolutionaries did not have an army. Previously, each colony had relied upon the [[Militia (United States)#History|militia]], made up of part-time citizen-soldiers, for local defense, or the raising of temporary "provincial regiments" during specific crises such as the [[French and Indian War]] of 1754–63. As tensions with Great Britain increased in the years leading to the war, colonists began to reform their militias in preparation for the perceived potential conflict. Training of militiamen increased after the passage of the [[Intolerable Acts]] in 1774. Colonists such as [[Richard Henry Lee]] proposed forming a national militia force, but the [[First Continental Congress]] rejected the idea.<ref>[[#Wright|Wright, 1983]], pp. 10–11</ref>

On April 23, 1775, the [[Massachusetts Provincial Congress]] authorized the raising of a [[colonial troops|colonial army]] consisting of 26 company regiments.  New Hampshire, Rhode Island, and Connecticut soon raised similar but smaller forces. On June 14, 1775, the [[Second Continental Congress]] decided to proceed with the establishment of a Continental Army for purposes of common defense, adopting the forces already in place outside Boston (22,000 troops) and New York (5,000).<ref name="auto">[http://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?ammem/hlaw:@field(DOCID+@lit(jc00235)): Cont'l Cong., Formation of the Continental Army, in 2 ''Journals of the Continental Congress, 1774–1789'' 89–90 (Library of Cong. eds., 1905)].</ref> It also raised the first ten companies of Continental troops on a one-year enlistment, riflemen from Pennsylvania, Maryland, Delaware and Virginia to be used as [[light infantry]],<ref name="auto"/> who became the [[1st Continental Regiment]] in 1776.

On June 15, 1775, the Congress elected by unanimous vote [[George Washington]] as Commander-in-Chief, who accepted and served throughout the war without any compensation except for reimbursement of expenses.<ref>[http://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?ammem/hlaw:@field(DOCID+@lit(jc00238)): Cont'l Cong., Commission for General Washington, in 2 ''Journals of the Continental Congress, 1774–1789'' 96-7 (Library of Cong. eds., 1905)].</ref><ref>[http://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?ammem/hlaw:@field(DOCID+@lit(jc00240)): Cont'l Cong., Instructions for General Washington, in 2 ''Journals of the Continental Congress, 1774–1789'' 100-1 (Library of Cong. eds., 1905)].</ref><ref>[http://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?ammem/hlaw:@field(DOCID+@lit(jc00580)): Cont'l Cong., Resolution Changing "United Colonies" to "United States", in 5 ''Journals of the Continental Congress, 1774–1789'' 747 (Library of Cong. eds., 1905)].</ref><ref>[http://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?ammem/hlaw:@field(DOCID+@lit(jc00237)): Cont'l Cong., Acceptance of Appointment by General Washington, in 2 ''Journals of the Continental Congress, 1774–1789'' 91–92 (Library of Cong. eds., 1905)].</ref>

On July 18, 1775, the Congress requested all colonies form militia companies from "all able bodied effective men, between sixteen and fifty years of age."  It was not uncommon for men younger than sixteen to enlist as most colonies had no requirement of parental consent for those under twenty-one (adulthood).<ref>{{citebook|title=Child Soldiers in the Western Imagination: From Patriots to Victims|first=David M.|last=Rosen|publisher=Rutgers University Press|date=2015}}</ref>

Four [[Major general|major-generals]] ([[Artemas Ward]], [[Charles Lee (general)|Charles Lee]], [[Philip Schuyler]], and [[Israel Putnam]]) and eight [[Brigadier general|brigadier-generals]] ([[Seth Pomeroy]], [[Richard Montgomery]], [[David Wooster]], [[William Heath]], [[Joseph Spencer]], [[John Thomas (general)|John Thomas]], [[John Sullivan (general)|John Sullivan]], and [[Nathanael Greene]]) were appointed by the Second Continental Congress in the course of a few days.<ref>[http://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?ammem/hlaw:@field(DOCID+@lit(jc00238)): Cont'l Cong., Commissions for Generals Ward and Lee, in 2 ''Journals of the Continental Congress, 1774–1789'' 97 (Library of Cong. eds., 1905)].</ref><ref>[http://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?ammem/hlaw:@field(DOCID+@lit(jc00239)): Cont'l Cong., Commissions for Generals Schuyler and Putnam, in 2 ''Journals of the Continental Congress, 1774–1789'' 99 (Library of Cong. eds., 1905)].</ref><ref>[http://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?ammem/hlaw:@field(DOCID+@lit(jc00242)): Cont'l Cong., Commissions for Generals Pomeroy, Montgomery, Wooster, Heath, Spencer, Thomas, Sullivan, and Greene, in 2 ''Journals of the Continental Congress, 1774–1789'' 103 (Library of Cong. eds., 1905)].</ref> After Pomeroy did not accept, John Thomas was appointed in his place.<ref>[http://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?ammem/hlaw:@field(DOCID+@lit(jc00265)): Cont'l Cong., Commission for General Thomas, in 2 ''Journals of the Continental Congress, 1774–1789'' 191 (Library of Cong. eds., 1905)].</ref>

[[File:Portrait of George Washington-transparent.png|right|thumb|General [[George Washington]] was appointed Commander-in-Chief of the Continental Army on June 15, 1775.]]

As the Continental Congress increasingly adopted the responsibilities and posture of a legislature for a sovereign state, the role of the Continental Army became the subject of considerable debate. Some Americans had a general aversion to maintaining a standing army; but on the other hand the requirements of the war against the British required the discipline and organization of a modern military. As a result, the army went through several distinct phases, characterized by official dissolution and reorganization of units.

Soldiers in the Continental Army were citizens who had volunteered to serve in the army (but were paid), and at various times during the war, standard enlistment periods lasted from one to three years. Early in the war the enlistment periods were short, as the [[Second Continental Congress|Continental Congress]] feared the possibility of the Continental Army evolving into a permanent army. The army never numbered more than 17,000 men. Turnover proved a constant problem, particularly in the winter of 1776–77, and longer enlistments were approved. Broadly speaking, Continental forces consisted of several successive armies, or establishments:
* The Continental Army of 1775, comprising the initial [[New England]] Army, organized by Washington into three divisions, six brigades, and 38 regiments. Major General Philip Schuyler's ten regiments in New York were sent to invade [[Canada]].
* The Continental Army of 1776, reorganized after the initial enlistment period of the soldiers in the 1775 army had expired. Washington had submitted recommendations to the Continental Congress almost immediately after he had accepted the position of Commander-in-Chief, but the Congress took time to consider and implement these. Despite attempts to broaden the recruiting base beyond New England, the 1776 army remained skewed toward the Northeast both in terms of its composition and of its geographical focus. This army consisted of 36 regiments, most standardized to a single battalion of 768 men strong and formed into eight companies, with a [[wikt:rank and file|rank-and-file]] strength of 640.
* The Continental Army of 1777–80 evolved out of several critical reforms and political decisions that came about when it became apparent that the British were sending massive forces to put an end to the [[American Revolution]]. The Continental Congress passed the "Eighty-eight Battalion Resolve", ordering each state to contribute one-battalion regiments in proportion to their population, and Washington subsequently received authority to raise an additional 16 battalions. Enlistment terms extended to three years or to "the length of the war" to avoid the year-end crises that depleted forces (including the notable near-collapse of the army at the end of 1776, which could have ended the war in a Continental, or American, loss by forfeit).
* The Continental Army of 1781–82 saw the greatest crisis on the American side in the war. Congress was bankrupt, making it very difficult to replenish the soldiers whose three-year terms had expired. Popular support for the war reached an all-time low, and Washington had to put down mutinies both in the [[Pennsylvania Line]] and in the [[New Jersey Line]]. Congress voted to cut funding for the Army, but Washington managed nevertheless to secure important strategic victories.
* The Continental Army of 1783–84 was succeeded by the [[United States Army]], which persists to this day. As peace was restored with the British, most of the regiments were disbanded in an orderly fashion, though several had already been diminished.

In addition to the Continental Army regulars, local militia units, raised and funded by individual colonies/states, participated in battles throughout the war. Sometimes the militia units operated independently of the Continental Army, but often local militias were called out to support and augment the Continental Army regulars during campaigns. (The militia troops developed a reputation for being prone to premature retreats, a fact that Brigadier-General [[Daniel Morgan]] integrated into his strategy at the [[Battle of Cowpens]] in 1781.)

The financial responsibility for providing pay, food, shelter, clothing, arms, and other equipment to specific units was assigned to states as part of the establishment of these units. States differed in how well they lived up to these obligations. There were constant funding issues and morale problems as the war continued. This led to the army offering low pay, often rotten food, hard work, cold, heat, poor clothing and shelter, harsh discipline, and a high chance of becoming a casualty.

An estimated 4% of the Continental Army was black (see [[African Americans in the Revolutionary War]]).]]

At the time of the [[Siege of Boston]], the Continental Army at [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]], in June 1775, is estimated to have numbered from 14–16,000 men from New England (though the actual number may have been as low as 11,000 because of desertions). Until Washington's arrival, it remained under the command of Artemas Ward, while John Thomas acted as executive officer and [[Richard Gridley]] commanded the artillery corps and was chief engineer. It was during this siege that Washington allegedly uttered his famous words, "It is cold out here." This was a poetic representation of the harsh conditions the men endured during the summer of the siege, and a reference to a political cartoon by [[Benjamin Franklin]]. It served as a piece of [[satire]] as it was a remark about cold conditions, while the men experienced some of the hottest [[temperature]]s of that year.

The British force in [[Boston]] was increasing by fresh arrivals. It numbered then about 10,000 men. Major Generals [[William Howe, 5th Viscount Howe|Howe]], [[Henry Clinton (American War of Independence)|Clinton]], and [[John Burgoyne|Burgoyne]], had arrived late in May and joined General [[Thomas Gage|Gage]] in forming and executing plans for dispersing the rebels. Feeling strong with these veteran officers and soldiers around him—and the presence of several Men-of-War under Admiral [[Samuel Graves|Graves]]—the governor issued a proclamation, declaring [[martial law]], branding the entire Continental Army and supporters as "rebels" and "parricides of the Constitution." Amnesty was offered to those who gave up their allegiance to the Continental Army and Congress in favor of the British authorities, though [[Samuel Adams]] and [[John Hancock]] were still wanted for [[high treason]]. This proclamation only served to strengthen the resolve of the Congress and Army.

After the British evacuation of Boston (prompted by the placement of Continental artillery overlooking the city in March 1776), the Continental Army relocated to New York. For the next five years, the main bodies of the Continental and British armies campaigned against one another in New York, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania. These campaigns included the notable battles of [[Battle of Trenton|Trenton]], [[Battle of Princeton|Princeton]], [[Battle of Brandywine|Brandywine]], [[Battle of Germantown|Germantown]], and Morristown, among many others.

The Continental Army was racially integrated, a condition the United States Army would not see again until [[Executive Order 9981|Truman ordered the desegregation of the military in 1948]]. [[African Americans in the Revolutionary War|African American slaves]] were promised freedom in exchange for military service in New England, and made up one fifth of the Northern Continental Army.<ref>[[Liberty!|Liberty! The American Revolution]] (Documentary) Episode II: ''Blows Must Decide: 1774–1776''. Twin Cities Public Television, 1997. {{ISBN|1-4157-0217-9}}</ref>

Throughout its existence, the Army was troubled by poor logistics, inadequate training, short-term enlistments, interstate rivalries, and Congress's inability to compel the states to provide food, money or supplies. In the beginning, soldiers enlisted for a year, largely motivated by patriotism; but as the war dragged on, bounties and other incentives became more commonplace. Two major mutinies late in the war drastically diminished the reliability of two of the main units, and there were constant discipline problems.

The army increased its effectiveness and success rate through a series of trials and errors, often at great human cost. General Washington and other distinguished officers were instrumental leaders in preserving unity, learning and adapting, and ensuring discipline throughout the eight years of war. In the winter of 1777–1778, with the addition of [[Friedrich Wilhelm von Steuben|Baron von Steuben]], of [[Prussia]]n origin, the training and discipline of the Continental Army began to vastly improve. (This was the infamous winter at [[Valley Forge]].) Washington always viewed the Army as a temporary measure and strove to maintain [[civilian control of the military]], as did the [[Second Continental Congress|Continental Congress]], though there were minor disagreements about how this was carried out.

Near the end of the war, the Continental Army was augmented by [[Expédition Particulière|a French expeditionary force]] (under [[Jean-Baptiste Donatien de Vimeur, comte de Rochambeau|General Rochambeau]]) and a squadron of the French navy (under the Comte de Barras), and in the late summer of 1781 the main body of the army travelled south to Virginia to rendezvous with the French West Indies fleet under Admiral [[Comte de Grasse]]. This resulted in the [[Siege of Yorktown]], the decisive [[Battle of the Chesapeake]], and the surrender of the British southern army. This essentially marked the end of the land war in North America, although the Continental Army returned to blockade the British northern army in New York until the peace treaty went into effect two years later, and battles took place elsewhere between British forces and those of France and its allies.

==Demobilization==

A small residual force remained at [[West Point, New York|West Point]] and some frontier outposts until Congress created the [[United States Army]] by their resolution of June 3, 1784.

Planning for the transition to a peacetime force had begun in April 1783 at the request of a congressional committee chaired by [[Alexander Hamilton]]. The commander-in-chief discussed the problem with key officers before submitting the army's official views on 2 May. Significantly, there was a broad consensus of the basic framework among the officers. Washington's proposal called for four components: a small regular army, a uniformly trained and organized militia, a system of arsenals, and a military academy to train the army's artillery and engineer officers. He wanted four infantry regiments, each assigned to a specific sector of the frontier, plus an artillery regiment. His proposed regimental organizations followed Continental Army patterns but had a provision for increased strength in the event of war. Washington expected the militia primarily to provide security for the country at the start of a war until the regular army could expand—the same role it had carried out in 1775 and 1776. Steuben and Duportail submitted their own proposals to Congress for consideration.

Although Congress declined on May 12 to make a decision on the peace establishment, it did address the need for some troops to remain on duty until the British evacuated New York City and several frontier posts. The delegates told Washington to use men enlisted for fixed terms as temporary garrisons. A detachment of those men from West Point [[Evacuation Day (New York)|reoccupied New York]] without incident on November 25. When Steuben's effort in July to negotiate a transfer of frontier forts with Major General [[Frederick Haldimand]] collapsed, however, the British maintained control over them, as they would into the 1790s. That failure and the realization that most of the remaining infantrymen's enlistments were due to expire by June 1784 led Washington to order Knox, his choice as the commander of the peacetime army, to discharge all but 500 infantry and 100 artillerymen before winter set in. The former regrouped as Jackson's Continental Regiment under Colonel [[Henry Jackson (general)|Henry Jackson]] of Massachusetts. The single artillery company, New Yorkers under John Doughty, came from remnants of the 2nd Continental Artillery Regiment.

Congress issued a proclamation on October 18, 1783, which approved Washington's reductions. On November 2, Washington then released his Farewell Order to the Philadelphia newspapers for nationwide distribution to the furloughed men. In the message he thanked the officers and men for their assistance and reminded them that "the singular interpositions of Providence in our feeble condition were such, as could scarcely escape the attention of the most unobserving; while the unparalleled perseverance of the Armies of the United States, through almost every possible suffering and discouragement for the space of eight long years, was little short of a standing miracle."

[[File:Cont Army Plz Billyb jeh.jpg|thumb|Continental Army Plaza, [[Williamsburg, Brooklyn]]]]
Washington believed that the blending of persons from every colony into "one patriotic band of Brothers" had been a major accomplishment, and he urged the veterans to continue this devotion in civilian life.

Washington said farewell to his remaining officers on December 4 at [[Fraunces Tavern]] in New York City. On December 23 he appeared in Congress, then sitting at Annapolis, and [[George Washington's resignation as commander-in-chief|returned his commission as commander-in-chief]]: "Having now finished the work assigned me, I retire from the great theatre of Action; and bidding an Affectionate farewell to this August body under whose orders I have so long acted, I here offer my Commission, and take my leave of all the employments of public life." Congress ended the War of American Independence on January 14, 1784, by ratifying the definitive peace treaty that had been signed in Paris on September 3.

Congress had again rejected Washington's concept for a peacetime force in October 1783. When moderate delegates then offered an alternative in April 1784 which scaled the projected army down to 900 men in one artillery and three infantry battalions, Congress rejected it as well, in part because New York feared that men retained from Massachusetts might take sides in a land dispute between the two states. Another proposal to retain 350 men and raise 700 new recruits also failed. On June 2 Congress ordered the discharge of all remaining men except twenty-five caretakers at [[Fort Pitt (Pennsylvania)|Fort Pitt]] and fifty-five at West Point. The next day it created a peace establishment acceptable to all interests.

The plan required four states to raise 700 men for one year's service. Congress instructed the Secretary at War to form the troops into eight infantry and two artillery companies. Pennsylvania, with a quota of 260 men, had the power to nominate a lieutenant colonel, who would be the senior officer. New York and Connecticut each were to raise 165 men and nominate a major; the remaining 110 men came from New Jersey. Economy was the watchword of this proposal, for each major served as a company commander, and line officers performed all staff duties except those of chaplain, surgeon, and surgeon's mate. Under [[Josiah Harmar]], the [[First American Regiment]] slowly organized and achieved permanent status as an infantry regiment of the new Regular Army. The lineage of the [[First American Regiment]] is carried on by the [[3rd United States Infantry Regiment (The Old Guard)]].

However the [[United States Army|United States military]] realized it needed a well-trained standing army following [[St. Clair's Defeat]] on November 4, 1791, when a force led by [[General]] [[Arthur St. Clair]] was almost entirely wiped out by the [[Western Confederacy]] near [[Fort Recovery, Ohio]]. The plans, which were supported by U.S. President [[George Washington]] and [[Henry Knox]], [[Secretary of War]], led to the disbandment of the Continental Army and the creation of the [[Legion of the United States]]. The command would be based on the 18th-century military works of [[Henry Bouquet]], a professional Swiss soldier who served as a [[colonel]] in the [[British army]], and French [[Marshal of France|Marshal]] [[Maurice de Saxe]]. In 1792 [[Anthony Wayne]], a renowned hero of the [[American Revolutionary War]], was encouraged to leave retirement and return to active service as Commander-in-Chief of the Legion with the rank of [[Major General]].

The legion was recruited and raised in [[Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania]]. It was formed into four sub-legions. These were created from elements of the [[First American Regiment|1st]] and [[2nd Infantry Regiment (United States)|2nd Regiments]] from the Continental Army. These units then became the [[3rd US Infantry Regiment (The Old Guard)|First]] and [[2nd Infantry Regiment (United States)|Second Sub-Legions]]. The Third and [[4th Infantry Regiment (United States)|Fourth]] Sub-Legions were raised from further recruits. From June 1792 to November 1792, the Legion remained cantoned at [[Fort Lafayette (Pennsylvania)|Fort LaFayette]] in Pittsburgh.
Throughout the winter of 1792–93, existing troops along with new recruits were drilled in military skills, tactics and discipline at [[Legionville]] on the banks of the [[Ohio River]] near present-day [[Baden, Pennsylvania]]. The following Spring the newly named Legion of the United States left Legionville for the [[Northwest Indian War]], a struggle between [[American Indians in the United States|American Indian]] tribes affiliated with the [[Western Confederacy]] in the area south of the [[Ohio River]]. The overwhelmingly successful campaign was concluded with the decisive victory at the [[Battle of Fallen Timbers]] on August 20, 1794, Maj. Gen. [[Anthony Wayne]] applied the techniques of wilderness operations perfected by Sullivan's 1779 expedition against the Iroquois. The training the troops received at Legionville was also seen as an instrumental to this overwhelming victory.

Nevertheless, Steuben's Blue Book remained the official manual for the legion, as well as for the militia of most states, until [[Winfield Scott]] in 1835.
In 1796, the [[United States Army]] was raised following the discontinuation with the legion of the United States. This preceded the graduation of the first cadets from [[United States Military Academy]] at [[West Point, New York]], which was established in 1802.

==Rank insignia==
[[File:The American Soldier - U.S. Center of Military History.jpg|thumb|Ribands as rank insignia: Aide-de-camp, commander-in-chief, brigadier-general.]]
During the [[American Revolutionary War]], the Continental Army initially wore [[ribbons]], [[cockade]]s and [[epaulettes]] of various colors as an ''ad hoc'' form of rank insignia, as General [[George Washington]] wrote in 1775:
{{quote |"As the Continental Army has unfortunately no uniforms, and consequently many inconveniences must arise from not being able to distinguish the commissioned officers from the privates, it is desired that some badge of distinction be immediately provided; for instance that the field officers may have red or pink colored cockades in their hats, the captains yellow or buff, and the [[subalterns]] green."}}

In 1776 captains were to have buff or white cockades.
