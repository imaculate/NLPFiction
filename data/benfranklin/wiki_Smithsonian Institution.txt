Once the money was in hand, eight years of Congressional haggling ensued over how to interpret Smithson's rather vague mandate "for the increase and diffusion of knowledge."<ref name="foundingfactsheet" /><ref name="gardens" />  Unfortunately, the money was invested by the US Treasury in bonds issued by the state of Arkansas which soon defaulted.  After heated debate, Massachusetts Representative (and ex-President) [[John Quincy Adams]] persuaded Congress to restore the lost funds with interest<ref>"Smithsonian Information Brochure", Smithsonian Visitor Information and Associates' Reception Center, May 2009</ref> and, despite designs on the money for other purposes, convinced his colleagues to preserve it for an institution of science and learning.<ref>Nagel, Paul (1999). "John Quincy Adams: A Public Life, a Private Life". Harvard University Press. p. 348.</ref>  Finally, on August 10, 1846, President [[James K.

===Museums and buildings===
The [[Smithsonian Institution Building]] ("the Castle") began construction in 1849. Designed by architect [[James Renwick Jr.]], its interiors were completed by general contractor Gilbert Cameron. The building opened in 1855.<ref>{{cite web|url={{NHLS url|id=66000867}}|title=National Register of Historic Places Inventory Nomination: Smithsonian Institution Building|last=Morton|first=W. Brown III|date=February 8, 1971|publisher=National Park Service|accessdate=May 11, 2009}}</ref>

The Smithsonian's first expansion came with construction of the [[Arts and Industries Building]] in 1881. Congress had promised to build a new structure for the museum if the 1876 [[Philadelphia Centennial Exposition]] generated enough income. It did, and the building was designed by architects [[Adolf Cluss]] and Paul Schulze, based on original plans developed by [[Major general (United States)|Major General]] [[Montgomery C. Meigs]] of the [[United States Army Corps of Engineers]]. It opened in 1881.<ref>{{cite web|url={{NHLS url|id=71000994}}|title=National Register of Historic Places Inventory Nomination: Arts and Industries Building of the Smithsonian Institution|last=Norton|first=W.

The [[National Zoological Park (United States)|National Zoological Park]] opened in 1889 to accommodate the Smithsonian's Department of Living Animals.<ref name="siarchives.si.edu">{{cite web |url=http://siarchives.si.edu/history/exhibits/pictures/national-zoological-park |title=National Zoological Park |work=Smithsonian Institution Archives |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141111025911/http://siarchives.si.edu/history/exhibits/pictures/national-zoological-park |archivedate=November 11, 2014 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> The park was designed by landscape architect [[Frederick Law Olmsted]].<ref name="siarchives.si.edu" />

The [[National Museum of Natural History]] opened in June 1911 to similarly accommodate the Smithsonian's United States National Museum, which had previously been housed in the Castle and then the Arts and Industries Building.<ref>{{Cite news | url=http://www.mnh.si.edu/about/history.htm | title=Museum History | publisher=National  Museum of Natural History | year=2008 | accessdate=2009-11-15 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090726053347/https://www.mnh.si.edu/about/history.htm | archivedate=July 26, 2009 | df=mdy-all }}</ref> This structure was designed by the D.C. architectural firm of [[Hornblower & Marshall]].<ref>"New Museum Plans."

When [[Detroit]] [[philanthropist]] [[Charles Lang Freer]] donated his private collection to the Smithsonian and funds to build the museum to hold it (which was named the [[Freer Gallery]]), it was among the Smithsonian's first major donations from a private individual.<ref>{{Cite book| publisher = Freer Gallery of Art, Smithsonian Institution, Arthur M.

More than 40 years would pass before the next museum, the Museum of History and Technology (renamed the [[National Museum of American History]] in 1980), opened in 1964.

===Smithsonian Latino Center===
In 1997, the Smithsonian Latino Center was created as a way to recognize Latinos across the Smithsonian Institution. The primary purpose of the center is to place Latino contributions to the arts, history, science, and national culture across the Smithsonian's museums and research centers.<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|url=http://latino.si.edu/About|title=About the Center|website=latino.si.edu|access-date=2016-05-18|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160602232938/http://latino.si.edu/About|archivedate=June 2, 2016|df=mdy-all}}</ref>

The center is a division of the Smithsonian Institution.<ref name=":1">{{Cite web|url=http://latino.si.edu/PDF/2007/YAP_PR_6.26.07.pdf|title=Smithsonian Latino Center's Young Ambassadors Arrive for Week of Cultural Programs in Washington, D.C.|last=Lara|first=Isabel|date=2007-06-26|website=Smithsonian Institution|publisher=|access-date=2016-05-18|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170216050238/http://latino.si.edu/PDF/2007/YAP_PR_6.26.07.pdf|archivedate=February 16, 2017|df=mdy-all}}</ref> As of May 2016, the center is run by an executive director, Eduardo Díaz.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://latino.si.edu/About/Staff|title=Smithsonian Latino Center Staff|website=latino.si.edu|access-date=2016-05-18|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160611141733/http://latino.si.edu/About/Staff|archivedate=June 11, 2016|df=mdy-all}}</ref>

====History====
At the time of its creation, the Smithsonian Institution had other entities dedicated to other minority groups: National Museum of the American Indian, Freer-Sackler Gallery for Asian Arts and Culture, African Art Museum, and the National Museum of African-American Heritage and Culture.<ref name=":2">{{cite web |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/style/documents/smithsonian/OlearyIGdeclaration.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2017-09-12 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170216085038/http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/style/documents/smithsonian/OlearyIGdeclaration.pdf |archivedate=February 16, 2017 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>

The opening of the center was prompted, in part, by the publishing of a report called "Willful Neglect: The Smithsonian and U.S. Latinos".<ref name=":2" />

According to documents obtained by ''[[The Washington Post]]'', when former Latino Center executive director [[Pilar O'Leary]] first took the job, the center faced employees who had "serious performance issues". No performance plans existed for the staff and unfulfilled financial obligations to sponsors existed. The website's quality was poor, and the center did not have a public affairs manager, a programs director, adequate human resources support, or cohesive mission statement.<ref name=":2" />

After difficult times in the first few years, the center improved. According to the Smithsonian, the center "support[s] scholarly research, exhibitions, public and educational programs, web-based content and virtual platforms, and collections and archives. [It] also manage[s] leadership and professional development programs for Latino youth, emerging scholars and museum professionals."<ref name=":0" /> Today, the website features a high-tech virtual museum.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://latino.si.edu/LVM|title=Smithsonian Latino Virtual Museum|website=latino.si.edu|access-date=2016-05-18|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160510114004/http://latino.si.edu/LVM|archivedate=May 10, 2016|df=mdy-all}}</ref>

====Young Ambassadors Program====
The Smithsonian Latino Center's Young Ambassadors Program (YAP) is a program within the Latino Center that reaches out to Latino high school students with the goal of encouraging them to become leaders in arts, sciences, and the humanities.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://latino.si.edu/Education/YAP|title=Young Ambassadors Program|website=latino.si.edu|access-date=2016-05-18|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160510115706/http://latino.si.edu/Education/YAP|archivedate=May 10, 2016|df=mdy-all}}</ref>

Students selected for the program travel to Washington, D.C. for an "enrichment seminar" that lasts approximately five days. Afterwards, students return to their communities to serve in a paid, one-month internship.<ref name=":1" />

Pilar O'Leary launched the program when she served as executive director of the Smithsonian Latino Center.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://issuu.com/washingtonlife/docs/holiday_2006__100mb_/80|title=Con Sabor!|last=|first=|date=2006|work=Washington Life Magazine "Substance and Style" Issue|access-date=2016-05-18|via=|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160616154819/https://issuu.com/washingtonlife/docs/holiday_2006__100mb_/80|archivedate=June 16, 2016|df=mdy-all}}</ref> According to the Latino Center, O'Leary told the press in 2007: "Our goal is to help our Young Ambassadors become the next generation of leaders in the arts and culture fields. This program encourages students to be proud of their roots and learn more about their cultural heritage to inspire them to educate the public in their own communities about how Latinos are enriching America's cultural fabric."<ref name=":1" />

==Publications==
The Institution publishes ''[[Smithsonian (magazine)|Smithsonian]]'' magazine monthly and ''[[Air & Space]]'' magazine bimonthly. 
''Smithsonian'' was the result of Secretary of the Smithsonian [[S. Dillon Ripley]] asking the retired editor of ''[[Life (magazine)|Life]]'' magazine [[Edward K.

The Smithsonian Office of Protection Services oversees security at the Smithsonian facilities and enforces laws and regulations for [[National Capital Parks]] together with the [[United States Park Police]].

The President's 2011 budget proposed just under $800 million in support for the Smithsonian, slightly increased from previous years.  Institution exhibits are free of charge, though in 2010 the [[National Commission on Fiscal Responsibility and Reform|Deficit Commission]] recommended admission fees.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.fiscalcommission.gov/sites/fiscalcommission.gov/files/documents/Illustrative_List_11.10.2010.pdf |title=$200 BILLION IN ILLUSTRATIVE SAVINGS |publisher=FiscalCommission.gov |date= |accessdate=July 1, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101119153741/http://www.fiscalcommission.gov/sites/fiscalcommission.gov/files/documents/Illustrative_List_11.10.2010.pdf |archivedate=November 19, 2010 |df=mdy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://newsdesk.si.edu/releases/smithsonian-responds-deficit-commission-s-recommendation-admission-fees |title=Smithsonian Responds to Deficit Commission's Recommendation on Admission Fees &#124; Newsdesk |publisher=Newsdesk.si.edu |date=November 12, 2010 |accessdate=November 18, 2010 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101116150742/http://newsdesk.si.edu/releases/smithsonian-responds-deficit-commission-s-recommendation-admission-fees |archivedate=November 16, 2010 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>

As approved by [[United States Congress|Congress]] on August 10, 1846, the legislation that created the Smithsonian Institution called for the creation of a Board of Regents to govern and administer the organization.<ref name="Stam"/> This 17-member board meets at least four times a year and includes as ''[[ex officio]]'' members the [[Chief Justice of the United States]] and the [[Vice President of the United States]]. The nominal head of the Institution is the [[Chancellor (education)|Chancellor]], an office which has traditionally been held by the Chief Justice. In September 2007, the board created the position of Chair of the Board of Regents, a position currently held by [[John W. McCarter]] of Illinois.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://newsdesk.si.edu/factsheets/smithsonian-board-regents|title=Smithsonian Board of Regents (in the "Newsdesk" section of the SI web site)|date=June 7, 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120612003823/http://newsdesk.si.edu/factsheets/smithsonian-board-regents|archivedate=June 12, 2012|df=mdy-all}}</ref>

Other members of the Board of Regents are three members of the [[U.S. House of Representatives]] appointed by the [[Speaker of the United States House of Representatives|Speaker of the House]]; three members of the Senate, appointed by the [[Senate of the United States#Officers|President ''pro tempore'' of the Senate]]; and nine citizen members, nominated by the board and approved by the Congress in a joint resolution signed by the President of the United States.<ref>[http://newsdesk.si.edu/kits/default.htm Smithsonian Press Kit] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100407183020/http://newsdesk.si.edu/kits/default.htm |date=April 7, 2010 }}</ref> Regents who are senators or representatives serve for the duration of their elected terms, while citizen Regents serve a maximum of two six-year terms. Regents are compensated on a part-time basis.

The [[chief executive officer]] (CEO) of the Smithsonian is the Secretary, who is appointed by the Board of Regents.  The Secretary also serves as secretary to the Board of Regents, but is not a voting member of that body. The Secretary of the Smithsonian has the [[Standing Rules of the United States Senate, Rule XXIII|privilege of the floor]] at the [[United States Senate]]. There have been 12 Secretaries.

==Controversies==

===''Enola Gay'' display===
{{See also|Enola Gay#Exhibition controversy|l1= ''Enola Gay'' exhibition controversy }}

In 1995, controversy arose over the exhibit at the [[National Air and Space Museum]] with the display of the ''[[Enola Gay]]'', the [[Superfortress]] used by the United States to drop the first [[atomic bomb]] used in [[World War II]]. The [[American Legion]] and [[Air Force Association]] believed the exhibit put forward only one side of the [[debate over the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki]], and that it emphasized the effect on victims without discussing its use within the overall context of the war. The Smithsonian changed the exhibit, displaying the aircraft only with associated technical data and without discussion of its historic role in the war.

===Censorship of "Seasons of Life and Land"===
In 2003, a [[National Museum of Natural History]] exhibit, [[Subhankar Banerjee]]'s ''Seasons of Life and Land'', featuring photographs of the [[Arctic National Wildlife Refuge]], was censored and moved to the basement by Smithsonian officials because they feared that its subject matter was too politically controversial.<ref>{{Cite news | url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/wp-dyn?pagename=article&node=&contentId=A17628-2003May20&notFound=true | work=The Washington Post | title=Smithsonian's Arctic Refuge Exhibit Draws Senate Scrutiny | first=Jacqueline | last=Trescott | date=May 21, 2003 | accessdate=May 23, 2010 | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110429173241/http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/wp-dyn?pagename=article&node=&contentId=A17628-2003May20&notFound=true | archivedate=April 29, 2011 | df=mdy-all }}</ref>

In November 2007, ''[[The Washington Post]]'' reported internal criticism has been raised regarding the institution's handling of the exhibit on the Arctic. According to documents and e-mails, the exhibit and its associated presentation were edited at high levels to add "scientific uncertainty" regarding the nature and impact of [[global warming]] on the [[Arctic]]. Acting Secretary of the Smithsonian [[Cristián Samper]] was interviewed by the ''Post'', and claimed the exhibit was edited because it contained conclusions that went beyond what could be proven by contemporary [[climatology]].<ref>{{Cite news | title=Scientists Fault Climate Exhibit Changes | date=November 16, 2007 | publisher= | url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/11/15/AR2007111502550.html?hpid=topnews | work=[[Washington Post]] | page=4 | accessdate=November 18, 2007 | first1=James V. | last1=Grimaldi | first2=Jacqueline | last2=Trescott | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110429173254/http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/11/15/AR2007111502550.html?hpid=topnews | archivedate=April 29, 2011 | df=mdy-all }}</ref> The Smithsonian is now a participant in the [[U.S. Global Change Research Program]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.globalchange.gov/about/program-structure/agencies |title=Integrating federal research and solutions for climate and global change |author= |date= |work=Participating Departments and Agencies |publisher=U.S. Global Change Research Program |accessdate=March 30, 2010 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100310123640/http://globalchange.gov/about/program-structure/agencies |archivedate=March 10, 2010 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>

The Smithsonian Institution provides access to its image collections for educational, scholarly, and nonprofit uses. Commercial uses are generally restricted unless permission is obtained. Smithsonian images fall into different copyright categories; some are protected by copyright, many are subject to license agreements or other contractual conditions, and some fall into the public domain, such as those prepared by Smithsonian employees as part of their official duties. The Smithsonian's terms of use for its digital content, including images, are set forth on the Smithsonian Web site.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.si.edu/copyright |title=Terms of use of this website |publisher=Si.edu |date= |accessdate=July 26, 2014 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090716063125/http://www.si.edu/copyright/ |archivedate=July 16, 2009 |df=mdy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://smithsonianimages.si.edu/siphoto/siphoto.portal?_nfpb=true&_pageLabel=content&contentpath=copyright.html |title=Smithsonian Images-Copyright |publisher=Smithsonianimages.si.edu |date=January 13, 2012 |accessdate=July 26, 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111002131433/http://smithsonianimages.si.edu/siphoto/siphoto.portal?_nfpb=true&_pageLabel=content&contentpath=copyright.html |archivedate=October 2, 2011 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>

In April 2006, the institution entered into an agreement of "first refusal" rights for its vast [[silent film|silent]] and [[public domain]] film archives with [[Showtime Networks]], mainly for use on the [[Smithsonian Channel]], a network created from this deal. Critics contend this agreement effectively gives Showtime control over the film archives, as it requires filmmakers to obtain permission from the network to use extensive amounts of film footage from the Smithsonian archives.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/04/01/arts/television/01smit.html?|title=Smithsonian Agreement Angers Filmmakers|publisher=New York Times|date=April 1, 2006|first=Edward|last=Wyatt|accessdate=May 23, 2010|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110501003705/http://www.nytimes.com/2006/04/01/arts/television/01smit.html|archivedate=May 1, 2011|df=mdy-all}}</ref>

The Smithsonian contends independent producers continue to have unchanged access to the institution and its collections as they had prior to the agreement.{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}} The process to gain access to film at the Smithsonian remains the same.{{Citation needed|date=October 2017}} Since January 2006, independent producers have made more than 500 requests to film in the museums and collections or to use archival footage and photos.{{citation needed|date=October 2010}}
