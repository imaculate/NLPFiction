'''Christiaan Huygens''' {{postnominals|FRS}} ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|h|aɪ|ɡ|ə|n|z|,_|ˈ|h|ɔɪ|-}} {{respell|HY|gənz|,_|HOY-}};<ref>[http://www.dictionary.com/browse/huygens "Huygens"]. ''[[Random House Webster's Unabridged Dictionary]]''.</ref> {{IPA-nl|ˈɦœyɣə(n)s|lang|ChristianHuygensPronunciation.ogg}}; {{lang-la|Hugenius}}; 14 April 1629 – 8 July 1695) was a Dutch [[physics|physicist]], [[mathematician]], [[astronomer]] and [[inventor]], who is widely regarded as one of the greatest scientists of all time and a major figure in the [[scientific revolution]]. In physics, Huygens made groundbreaking contributions in [[optics]] and [[mechanics]], while as an astronomer he is chiefly known for his studies of the [[rings of Saturn]] and the discovery of its moon [[Titan (moon)|Titan]]. As an inventor, he improved the design of the telescope with the invention of the [[Huygenian eyepiece]]. His most famous invention, however, was the invention of the [[pendulum clock]] in 1656, which was a breakthrough in timekeeping and became the most accurate timekeeper for almost 300 years. Because he was the first to use mathematical formulae to describe the laws of physics, Huygens has been called the first [[Theoretical physics|theoretical physicist]] and the founder of [[mathematical physics]].<ref>Dijksterhuis E.J (1950) ''De mechanisering van het wereldbeeld''. Meulenhoff, Amsterdam.</ref><ref>Andriesse, C.D. (2005) ''Huygens: The Man Behind the Principle''. Cambridge University Press. Cambridge: 6</ref>

In 1659, Huygens was the first to derive the now standard formula for the [[centripetal force]] in his work ''De vi centrifuga''. The formula played a central role in [[classical mechanics]] and became known as the second of [[Newton's laws of motion]]. Huygens was also the first to formulate the correct laws of [[elastic collision]] in his work ''De motu corporum ex percussione'', but his findings were not published until 1703, after his death. In the field of optics, he is best known for his [[wave theory of light]], which he proposed in 1678 and described in 1690 in his ''[[Treatise on Light]]'', which is regarded as the first mathematical theory of light. His theory was initially rejected in favor of [[Isaac Newton]]'s [[corpuscular theory of light]], until [[Augustin-Jean Fresnel]] adopted Huygens' principle in 1818 and showed that it could explain the rectilinear propagation and diffraction effects of light. Today this principle is known as the [[Huygens–Fresnel principle]].

Huygens invented the [[pendulum clock]] in 1656, which he patented the following year. In addition to this invention, his research in [[horology]] resulted in an extensive analysis of the [[pendulum]] in his 1673 book ''[[Horologium Oscillatorium]]'', which is regarded as one of the most important 17th-century works in mechanics. While the first part of the book contains descriptions of clock designs, most of the book is an analysis of pendulum motion and a theory of [[curve]]s. In 1655, Huygens began grinding lenses with his brother Constantijn in order to build telescopes to conduct astronomical research. He designed a 50-power [[refracting telescope]] with which he discovered that the [[Rings of Saturn|ring of Saturn]] was "a thin, flat ring, nowhere touching, and inclined to the ecliptic." It was with this telescope that he also discovered the first of Saturn's moons, Titan. He eventually developed in 1662 what is now called the [[Huygenian eyepiece]], a telescope with two lenses, which diminished the amount of [[Dispersion (optics)|dispersion]].

As a mathematician, Huygens was a pioneer on [[probability]] and wrote his first treatise on [[probability theory]] in 1657 with the work ''Van Rekeningh in Spelen van Gluck''. [[Frans van Schooten]], who was the private tutor of Huygens, translated the work as ''De ratiociniis in ludo aleae'' ("On Reasoning in Games of Chance"). The work is a systematic treatise on probability and deals with [[games of chance]] and in particular the [[problem of points]]. The modern concept of probability grew out of the use of expectation values by Huygens and [[Blaise Pascal]] (who encouraged him to write the work).

The last years of Huygens, who never married, were characterized by loneliness and depression. As a [[rationalism|rationalist]], he refused to believe in an [[immanence|immanent]] supreme being, and could not accept the Christian faith of his upbringing. Although Huygens did not believe in such a supernatural being, he did hypothesize on the possibility of [[extraterrestrial life]] in his ''Cosmotheoros'', which was published shortly before his death in 1695. He speculated that extraterrestrial life was possible on planets similar to Earth and wrote that the availability of water in liquid form was a necessity for life.

==Student years==
His father sent Huygens to study law and mathematics at the [[University of Leiden]], where he studied from May 1645 to March 1647.<ref name="completedictionary"/> [[Frans van Schooten]] was an academic at Leiden from 1646, and also a private tutor to Huygens and his elder brother, replacing Stampioen on the advice of Descartes.<ref>{{cite book|author=H.

After two years, from March 1647, Huygens continued his studies at the newly founded [[Orange College of Breda|Orange College]], in [[Breda]], where his father was a [[curator]]: the change occurred because of a duel between his brother Lodewijk and another student.<ref>[http://www.proevenvanvroeger.nl/eindopdrachten/huygens/huygensfamily.pdf Christiaan Huygens – A family affair, by Bram Stoffele, pg 80.]</ref> Constantijn Huygens was closely involved in the new College, which lasted only to 1669; the rector was [[André Rivet]].<ref>{{cite book|author=C.

While his father Constantijn had wished his son Christiaan to be a diplomat, it also was not to be. In political terms, the [[First Stadtholderless Period]] that began in 1650 meant that the House of Orange was not in power, removing Constantijn's influence. Further, he realised that his son had no interest in such a career.<ref name="Dictionary, p. 469">Dictionary, p. 469.</ref>

==Early correspondence==
[[File:Huygens - Correspondance. 1638-1656, 1888 - 3917544.tif|thumb|''Correspondance'']]
Huygens generally wrote in French or Latin.<ref>{{cite book|author=Lynn Thorndike|title=History of Magic & Experimental Science 1923|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Sr923sVWH_QC&pg=PA622|accessdate=11 May 2013|date=1 March 2003|publisher=Kessinger Publishing|isbn=978-0-7661-4316-6|page=622}}</ref> While still a college student at Leiden he began a correspondence with the intelligencer [[Marin Mersenne|Mersenne]], who died quite soon afterwards in 1648.<ref name="completedictionary"/> Mersenne wrote to Constantijn on his son's talent for mathematics, and flatteringly compared him to [[Archimedes]] (3 January 1647). The letters show the early interests of Huygens in mathematics. In October 1646 there is the [[suspension bridge]], and the demonstration that a [[catenary]] is not a [[parabola]].<ref>{{cite book|author=[[Leonhard Euler]]|editor=[[Clifford Truesdell]]|title=The Rational Mechanics of Flexible or Elastic Bodies 1638–1788: Introduction to Vol. X and XI|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gxrzm6y10EwC&pg=PA44|accessdate=10 May 2013|date=1 January 1980|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-3-7643-1441-5|pages=44–6}}</ref> In 1647/8 they cover the claim of [[Grégoire de Saint-Vincent]] to [[squaring the circle]]; rectification of the ellipse; projectiles, and the [[vibrating string]].<ref>{{cite book|author=C.

In 1654, Huygens returned to his father's house in The Hague, and was able to devote himself entirely to research.<ref name="completedictionary"/> The family had another house, not far away at [[Hofwijck]], and he spent time there during the summer. His scholarly life did not allow him to escape bouts of depression.<ref>{{cite book|author=H. J. M.

[[File:Hofwijck garden-plans drawing.png|thumb|The garden plan at Hofwijck, 1653]]

Subsequently, Huygens developed a broad range of correspondents, though picking up the threads after 1648 was hampered by the five-year ''[[Fronde]]'' in France. Visiting Paris in 1655, Huygens called on [[Ismael Boulliau]] to introduce himself. Then Boulliau took him to see [[Claude Mylon]].<ref>{{cite book|author=C. D. Andriesse|title=Huygens: The Man Behind the Principle|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6FTqA9fwxFMC&pg=PA134|accessdate=10 May 2013|date=25 August 2005|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-85090-2|page=134}}</ref> The Parisian group of savants that had gathered around Mersenne held together into the 1650s, and Mylon, who had assumed the secretarial role, took some trouble from then on to keep Huygens in touch.<ref>{{cite book|author=Thomas Hobbes|title=The Correspondence: 1660–1679|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GYF_mBtgIVwC&pg=PA868|accessdate=10 May 2013|date=1997|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-823748-8|page=868}}</ref> Through [[Pierre de Carcavi]] Huygens corresponded in 1656 with [[Pierre de Fermat]], whom he admired greatly, though this side of idolatry. The experience was bittersweet and even puzzling, since it became clear that Fermat had dropped out of the research mainstream, and his priority claims could probably not be made good in some cases. Besides, Huygens was looking by then to apply mathematics, while Fermat's concerns ran to purer topics.<ref>{{cite book|author=Michael S. Mahoney|title=The Mathematical Career of Pierre de Fermat: 1601–1665|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=My19IcewAnoC&pg=PA67|accessdate=10 May 2013|date=1994|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=978-0-691-03666-3|pages=67–8}}</ref>

==Scientific debut==
Huygens was often slow to publish his results and discoveries. In the early days his mentor Frans van Schooten was cautious for the sake of his reputation.<ref>{{cite book|author=C. D. Andriesse|title=Huygens: The Man Behind the Principle|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6FTqA9fwxFMC&pg=PA126|accessdate=10 May 2013|date=25 August 2005|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-85090-2|page=126}}</ref>

The first work Huygens put in print was ''Theoremata de quadratura'' (1651) in the field of [[quadrature (mathematics)|quadrature]]. It included material discussed with Mersenne some years before, such as the fallacious nature of the squaring of the circle by Grégoire de Saint-Vincent. His preferred methods were those of [[Archimedes]] and Fermat.<ref name="Dict470"/> Quadrature was a live issue in the 1650s, and through Mylon, Huygens intervened in the discussion of the mathematics of [[Thomas Hobbes]]. Persisting in trying to explain the errors Hobbes had fallen into, he made an international reputation.<ref>{{cite book|author=Schoneveld, Cornelis W|title=Intertraffic of the Mind: Studies in Seventeenth-century Anglo-Dutch Translation with a Checklist of Books Translated from English Into Dutch, 1600–1700|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1s4UAAAAIAAJ&pg=PA41|accessdate=22 April 2013|date=1983|publisher=Brill Archive|isbn=978-90-04-06942-8|page=41}}</ref>

Huygens moved back to [[The Hague]] in 1681 after suffering serious depressive illness. In 1684, he published ''Astroscopia Compendiaria'' on his new tubeless [[aerial telescope]].

==Work in natural philosophy==
Huygens has been called the leading European natural philosopher between Descartes and Newton.<ref>{{cite book|author=Anders Hald|title=A History of Probability and Statistics and Their Applications before 1750|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pOQy6-qnVx8C&pg=PA123|accessdate=11 May 2013|date=25 February 2005|publisher=John Wiley & Sons|isbn=978-0-471-72517-6|page=123}}</ref> He adhered to the tenets of the [[mechanical philosophy]] of his time. In particular he sought explanations of the [[force of gravity]] that avoided [[action at a distance]].<ref>{{cite book|author=William L. Harper|title=Isaac Newton's Scientific Method: Turning Data into Evidence about Gravity and Cosmology|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oKGlHjDzGjQC&pg=PA206|accessdate=23 April 2013|date=8 December 2011|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-957040-9|pages=206–7}}</ref>

In common with [[Robert Boyle]] and [[Jacques Rohault]], Huygens adhered to what has been called, more explicitly, "experimentally oriented corpuscular-mechanical" natural philosophy. In the analysis of the [[Scientific Revolution]] this appears as a mainstream position, at least from the founding of the Royal Society to the emergence of Newton, and was sometimes labelled "Baconian", while not being [[inductivist]] or identifying with the views of [[Francis Bacon]] in a simple-minded way.<ref>{{cite book |author1=R.

It proved a long process, brought to the surface an experimental issue ("anomalous suspension") and the theoretical issue of ''[[horror vacui (physics)|horror vacui]]'', and ended in July 1663 as Huygens became a Fellow of the Royal Society. It has been said that Huygens finally accepted Boyle's view of the void, as against the Cartesian denial of it;<ref>{{cite book|author=David B. Wilson|title=Seeking nature's logic|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=53w2gMknsMYC&pg=PA19|accessdate=12 May 2013|date=1 January 2009|publisher=Penn State Press|isbn=978-0-271-04616-7|page=19}}</ref> and also (in ''[[Leviathan and the Air Pump]]'') that the [[replication of results]] trailed off messily.<ref>{{cite book |author1=[[Stephen Shapin]]|author2=[[Simon Schaffer]]|title=[[Leviathan and the Air Pump]]|date=1989 |publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=0-691-02432-4 |pages=235–56}}</ref>

Newton's influence on [[John Locke]] was mediated by Huygens, who assured Locke that Newton's mathematics was sound, leading to Locke's acceptance of a "corpuscular-mechanical" physics.<ref name="Redman1997">{{cite book|author=Deborah Redman|title=The Rise of Political Economy As a Science: Methodology and the Classical Economists|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1faeMedY8k8C&pg=PA62|accessdate=12 May 2013|date=1997|publisher=MIT Press|isbn=978-0-262-26425-9|page=62}}</ref>

===Laws of motion, impact and gravitation===
The general approach of the mechanical philosophers was to postulate theories of the kind now called "contact action". Huygens adopted this method, but not without seeing its difficulties and failures.<ref>{{cite book|author=Tian Yu Cao|title=Conceptual Developments of 20th Century Field Theories|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=l4PtgYXpb_oC&pg=PA25|accessdate=11 May 2013|date=14 May 1998|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-63420-5|pages=25–}}</ref> Leibniz, his student in Paris, abandoned the theory.<ref>Garber and Ayers, p. 595.</ref> Seeing the universe this way made the theory of collisions central to physics. The requirements of the mechanical philosophy, in the view of Huygens, were stringent. Matter in motion made up the universe, and only explanations in those terms could be truly intelligible. While he was influenced by the [[Cartesianism|Cartesian]] approach, he was less doctrinaire.<ref>{{cite book|author=Peter Dear|title=The Intelligibility of Nature: How Science Makes Sense of the World|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=W1GAG3vJHpgC&pg=PA25|accessdate=23 April 2013|date=15 September 2008|publisher=University of Chicago Press|isbn=978-0-226-13950-0|page=25}}</ref> He studied [[elastic collision]]s in the 1650s but delayed publication for over a decade.<ref name="Dict470"/>
[[File:Collision huygens.gif|thumb|Depiction from Huygens, ''Oeuvres Complètes'': a boating metaphor underlay the way of thinking about [[relative motion]], and so simplifying the theory of colliding bodies]]
Huygens concluded quite early that [[Cartesian laws of motion|Descartes's laws]] for the elastic collision of two bodies must be wrong, and he formulated the correct laws.<ref>''The Beginnings of Modern Science'', edited by Rene Taton, Basic Books, 1958, 1964.</ref> An important step was his recognition of the [[Galilean invariance]] of the problems.<ref>Garber and Ayers, pp. 666–7.</ref> His views then took many years to be circulated.

Huygens stated what is now known as the second of  [[Newton's laws of motion]] in a quadratic form.<ref name="mach">[[Ernst Mach]], ''The Science of Mechanics'' (1919), e.g. pp. 143, 172, 187 <https://archive.org/details/scienceofmechani005860mbp>.</ref> In 1659 he derived the now standard formula for the [[centripetal force]], exerted on an object describing a [[circular motion]], for instance by the string to which it is attached. In modern notation:

:<math>F_{c}=\frac{m\ v^2}{r}</math>

with ''m'' the [[mass (physics)|mass]] of the object, ''v'' the [[velocity]] and ''r'' the [[radius]]. The publication of the general formula for this force in 1673 was a significant step in studying orbits in astronomy. It enabled the transition from [[Kepler's third law]] of planetary motion, to the [[inverse square law]] of gravitation.<ref>{{cite book|author=J. B.

The approach used by Huygens also missed some central notions of [[mathematical physics]], which were not lost on others. His work on pendulums came very close to the theory of [[simple harmonic motion]]; but the topic was covered fully for the first time by Newton, in Book II of his ''[[Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica|Principia Mathematica]]'' (1687).<ref name="Allen1999">{{cite book|author=Richard Allen|title=David Hartley on human nature|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NCu6HhGlAB8C&pg=PA98|accessdate=12 May 2013|date=1999|publisher=SUNY Press|isbn=978-0-7914-9451-6|page=98}}</ref> In 1678 Leibniz picked out of Huygens's work on collisions the idea of [[Conservation law (physics)|conservation law]] that Huygens had left implicit.<ref>{{cite book|author=Nicholas Jolley|title=The Cambridge Companion to Leibniz|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SnRis5Gdi8gC&pg=PA279|accessdate=12 May 2013|date=1995|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-36769-1|page=279}}</ref>

===Optics===
Huygens is remembered especially for his [[wave]] theory of light, which he first communicated in 1678 to the Paris Académie des sciences. It was published in 1690 in his ''[[Traité de la lumière]]''<ref>Christiaan Huygens, [https://books.google.com/books?id=X9PKaZlChggC&pg=PP5 ''Traité de la lumiere''...] (Leiden, Netherlands: Pieter van der Aa, 1690), Chapter 1.</ref> (Treatise on light<ref name="HuyThomp1912">C. Huygens (1690), translated by Silvanus P. Thompson (1912), ''[https://archive.org/details/treatiseonlight031310mbp Treatise on Light]'', London: Macmillan, 1912; [http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14725 Project Gutenberg edition], 2005; [http://www.grputland.com/2016/06/errata-in-various-editions-of-huygens-treatise-on-light.html Errata], 2016.</ref>), making it the first mathematical theory of light. He refers to [[Ignace-Gaston Pardies]], whose manuscript on optics helped him on his wave theory.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=X9PKaZlChggC&pg=PP5 ''Traité de la lumiere''...] (Leiden, Netherlands: Pieter van der Aa, 1690), Chapter 1. From [https://books.google.com/books?id=X9PKaZlChggC&pg=PA18 page 18]</ref>

Huygens assumes that the [[speed of light]] is finite, as had been shown in an experiment by [[Ole Rømer|Olaus Roemer]] in 1679, but which Huygens is presumed to have already believed.<ref name="Smith1987">{{cite book|author=A.

It posits light radiating [[wavefront]]s with the common notion of light rays depicting propagation normal to those wavefronts. Propagation of the wavefronts is then explained as the result of [[spherical wave]]s being emitted at every point along the wave front (the [[Huygens–Fresnel principle]]).<ref>Shapiro, p. 208.</ref> It assumed an omnipresent [[luminiferous aether|ether]], with transmission through perfectly elastic particles, a revision of the view of Descartes. The nature of light was therefore a [[longitudinal wave]].<ref name="Smith1987"/>

Huygens had experimented in 1672 with double refraction ([[birefringence]]) in Icelandic spar ([[calcite]]), a phenomenon discovered in 1669 by [[Rasmus Bartholin]]. At first he could not elucidate what he found.<ref name="Dictionary" /> He later explained it<ref name="HuyThomp1912"/> with his wave front theory and concept of [[evolute]]s. He also developed ideas on [[caustic (optics)|caustics]].<ref>{{cite book|author=[[Ivor Grattan-Guinness]]|title=Landmark Writings in Western Mathematics 1640–1940|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UdGBy8iLpocC&pg=PA43|accessdate=23 April 2013|date=11 February 2005|publisher=Elsevier|isbn=978-0-08-045744-4|page=43}}</ref> Newton in his ''[[Opticks]]'' of 1704 proposed instead a [[corpuscular theory of light]]. The theory of Huygens was not widely accepted, one strong objection being that longitudinal waves have only a single [[polarization (waves)|polarization]] which cannot explain the observed birefringence. However the 1801 [[Young's interference experiment|interference experiments]] of [[Thomas Young (scientist)|Thomas Young]] and [[François Arago ]]'s 1819 detection of the [[Poisson spot]] could not be explained through any particle theory, reviving the ideas of Huygens and wave models. In 1821 [[Fresnel]] was able to explain birefringence as a result of light being not a longitudinal (as had been assumed) but actually a [[transverse wave]].<ref>{{cite book|author1=Darryl J. Leiter|author2=Sharon Leiter|title=A to Z of Physicists|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Yz1CFkrZ8QMC&pg=PA108|accessdate=11 May 2013|date=1 January 2009|publisher=Infobase Publishing|isbn=978-1-4381-0922-0|page=108}}</ref> The thus-named [[Huygens–Fresnel principle]] was the basis for the advancement of [[physical optics]], explaining all aspects of light propagation. It was only understanding the detailed interaction of light with [[atoms]] that awaited [[quantum mechanics]] and the discovery of the [[photon]].
 
Huygens investigated the use of lenses in projectors. He is credited as the inventor of the [[magic lantern]], described in correspondence of 1659.<ref>{{cite book|author=Jordan D.

Huygens designed more accurate [[clock]]s than were available at the time.

Huygens motivation for inventing the pendulum clock was to create an accurate [[marine chronometer]] that could be used to find [[longitude]] by [[celestial navigation]] during sea voyages.  Exploiting the invention at sea proved troublesome, however, because the rocking motion of the ship disturbed the motion of the pendulum. In 1660 Lodewijk Huygens made a trial on a voyage to Spain, and reported that heavy weather made the clock useless.

In 1673 Huygens published ''[[Horologium Oscillatorium|Horologium Oscillatorium sive de motu pendulorum]]'', his major work on [[pendulum]]s and horology. It had been observed by Mersenne and others that pendulums are not quite [[isochronous]]: their period depends on their width of swing, with wide swings taking slightly longer than narrow swings.<ref>Marin Mersenne 1647  ''Reflectiones Physico-Mathematicae'', Paris, Chapter 19, cited in {{cite conference

Huygens analyzed this problem by finding the curve down which a mass will slide under the influence of gravity in the same amount of time, regardless of its starting point; the so-called [[tautochrone curve|tautochrone problem]]. By geometrical methods which were an early use of [[calculus]], he showed it to be a cycloid, rather than the circular arc of a pendulum's bob, and therefore that pendulums are not isochronous. He also solved a problem posed by Mersenne: how to calculate the period of a pendulum made of an arbitrarily shaped swinging rigid body. This involved discovering the [[center of oscillation]] and its reciprocal relationship with the pivot point. In the same work, he analysed the [[conical pendulum]], consisting of a weight on a cord moving in a circle, using the concept of centrifugal force.

[[File:Christiaan Huygens - Clock - Rijksmuseum, Amsterdam - 2.JPG|thumb|Huygens clock, [[Rijksmuseum]], Amsterdam]]
Huygens was the first to derive the formula for the [[Frequency|period]] of an ideal mathematical pendulum (with massless rod or cord and length much longer than its swing), in modern notation:

:<math>T = 2 \pi \sqrt{\frac{l}{g}}</math>

with ''T'' the period, ''l'' the length of the pendulum and ''g'' the [[gravitational acceleration]]. By his study of the oscillation period of compound pendulums Huygens made pivotal contributions to the development of the concept of [[moment of inertia]].<ref name="mach" />

Huygens also observed [[coupled oscillation]]s: two of his pendulum clocks mounted next to each other on the same support often became synchronized, swinging in opposite directions. He reported the results by letter to the Royal Society, and it is referred to as "[[odd sympathy|an odd kind of sympathy]]" in the Society's minutes.<ref>[[Thomas Birch]], "The History of the Royal Society of London, for Improving of Natural Knowledge, in which the most considerable of those papers...as a supplement to the Philosophical Transactions", vol 2, (1756) p 19.</ref><ref>A copy of the letter appears in C. Huygens, in Oeuvres Completes de Christian Huygens, edited by M. Nijhoff (Societe Hollandaise des Sciences, The Hague, The Netherlands, 1893), Vol. 5, p. 246 (in French).</ref> This concept is now known as [[Entrainment (physics)|entrainment]].

====Balance spring watch====
Huygens developed a [[balance spring]] watch in the same period as, though independently of, [[Robert Hooke]]. Controversy over the priority persisted for centuries. A Huygens watch employed a spiral balance spring; but he used this form of spring initially only because the balance in his first watch rotated more than one and a half turns. He later used spiral springs in more conventional watches, made for him by [[Thuret family|Thuret]] in Paris from around 1675.

[[File:Huygens Systema Saturnium.jpg|thumb|left|Huygens' explanation for the aspects of Saturn, ''Systema Saturnium'', 1659.]]

Such springs were essential in modern watches with a detached [[lever escapement]] because they can be adjusted for [[isochronism]]. Watches in the time of Huygens and Hooke, however, employed the very undetached [[verge escapement]]. It interfered with the isochronal properties of any form of balance spring, spiral or otherwise.

In February 2006, a long-lost copy of Hooke's handwritten notes from several decades of [[Royal Society]] meetings was discovered in a cupboard in [[Hampshire]], England. The balance-spring priority controversy appears, by the evidence contained in those notes, to be settled in favour of Hooke's claim.<ref>Nature – International Weekly Journal of Science, number 439, pages 638–639, 9 February 2006</ref><ref>Notes and Records of the Royal Society (2006) 60, pages 235–239, 'Report – The Return of the Hooke Folio' by Robyn Adams and Lisa Jardine</ref>

In 1675, Huygens patented a [[pocket watch]]. The watches which were made in Paris from c. 1675 and following the Huygens plan are notable for lacking a [[fusee (horology)|fusee]] for equalizing the mainspring torque. The implication is that Huygens thought that his spiral spring would isochronise the balance, in the same way that he thought that the cycloidally shaped suspension curbs on his clocks would isochronise the pendulum.

===Astronomy===
[[File:Aerialtelescope.jpg|thumb|upright|Huygens' telescope without tube. Picture from his 1684 ''Astroscopia Compendiaria tubi optici molimine liberata'' (compound telescopes without a tube)]]

====Saturn's rings and Titan====
In 1655, Huygens proposed that [[Saturn]] was surrounded by a solid ring, "a thin, flat ring, nowhere touching, and inclined to the ecliptic." Using a 50 power [[refracting telescope]] that he designed himself, Huygens also discovered the first of Saturn's moons, [[Titan (moon)|Titan]].<ref>Ron Baalke, [http://www2.jpl.nasa.gov/saturn/back.html Historical Background of Saturn's Rings] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090321071339/http://www2.jpl.nasa.gov/saturn/back.html |date=21 March 2009 }}</ref> In the same year he observed and sketched the [[Orion Nebula]]. His drawing, the first such known of the Orion nebula, was published in ''Systema Saturnium'' in 1659. Using his modern telescope he succeeded in subdividing the nebula into different stars. The brighter interior now bears the name of the ''Huygenian region'' in his honour.<ref>{{cite book|author=Antony Cooke|title=Visual Astronomy Under Dark Skies: A New Approach to Observing Deep Space|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=T64M5qlZTxoC&pg=PA67|accessdate=24 April 2013|date=1 January 2005|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-1-84628-149-5|page=67}}</ref> He also discovered several [[nebula|interstellar nebulae]] and some [[double star]]s.

====Mars and Syrtis Major====
In 1659, Huygens was the first to observe a surface feature on another planet, [[Syrtis Major Planum|Syrtis Major]], a volcanic plain on [[Mars]].  He used repeated observations of the movement of this feature over the course of a number of days to estimate the length of day on Mars, which he did quite accurately to 24 1/2 hours.  This figure is only a few minutes off of the actual length of the Martian day of 24 hours, 37 minutes.<ref>http://www.marsdaily.com/reports/A_dark_spot_on_Mars_Syrtis_Major_999.html</ref>

====''Cosmotheoros''====
Shortly before his death in 1695, Huygens completed ''Cosmotheoros'', published posthumously in 1698. In it he speculated on the existence of [[extraterrestrial life]], on other planets, which he imagined was similar to that on Earth. Such speculations were not uncommon at the time, justified by [[Copernicanism]] or the [[plenitude principle]]. But Huygens went into greater detail,<ref>{{cite book|author=Philip C. Almond|title=Adam and Eve in Seventeenth-Century Thought|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Rx1el1IsopEC&pg=PA61|accessdate=24 April 2013|date=27 November 2008|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-09084-1|pages=61–2}}</ref> though without the benefit of understanding Newton's laws of gravitation, or the fact that the atmospheres on other planets are composed of different gases.<ref>https://www.houstonpublicmedia.org/articles/shows/engines-of-our-ingenuity/engines-podcast/2017/04/05/194011/engines-of-our-ingenuity-1329-life-in-outer-space-in-1698/</ref> The work, translated into English in its year of publication, has been seen as in the fanciful tradition of [[Francis Godwin]], [[John Wilkins]] and [[Cyrano de Bergerac]], and fundamentally [[Utopian]]; and also to owe in its concept of [[planet]] to [[cosmography]] in the sense of [[Peter Heylin]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Postmus |first=Bouwe |chapter=Plokhoy's ''A way pronouned'': Mennonite Utopia or Millennium? |editors=Dominic Baker-Smith and Cedric Charles Barfoot|title=Between dream and nature: essays on utopia and dystopia |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-bTyK6Yri4UC&pg=PA86|accessdate=24 April 2013|date=1987|location=Amsterdam |publisher=Rodopi|isbn=978-90-6203-959-3|pages=86–8}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|author1=Juliet Cummins|author2=David Burchell|title=Science, Literature, and Rhetoric in Early Modern England|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LdL8iy4-OwQC&pg=PA194|accessdate=24 April 2013|date=2007|publisher=Ashgate Publishing, Ltd.|isbn=978-0-7546-5781-1|pages=194–5}}</ref>

Huygens wrote that availability of water in liquid form was essential for life and that the properties of water must vary from planet to planet to suit the temperature range. He took his observations of dark and bright spots on the surfaces of Mars and Jupiter to be evidence of water and ice on those planets.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.brighthub.com/science/space/articles/50441.aspx |title=Johar Huzefa (2009) Nothing But The Facts – Christiaan Huygens |publisher=Brighthub.com |date=28 September 2009 |accessdate=13 June 2010}}</ref> He argued that extraterrestrial life is neither confirmed nor denied by the Bible, and questioned why God would create the other planets if they were not to serve a greater purpose than that of being admired from Earth. Huygens postulated that the great distance between the planets signified that God had not intended for beings on one to know about the beings on the others, and had not foreseen how much humans would advance in scientific knowledge.<ref>{{cite book|last=Jacob|first=Margaret|title=The Scientific Revolution|date=2010|publisher=Bedford/St. Martin's|location=Boston|pages=29, 107–114}}</ref>

It was also in this book that Huygens published his method for estimating [[stellar distance]]s. He made a series of smaller holes in a screen facing the sun, until he estimated the light was of the same intensity as that of the star [[Sirius]]. He then calculated that the angle of this hole was <math>1/27,664</math>th the diameter of the Sun, and thus it was about 30,000 times as far away, on the (incorrect) assumption that Sirius is as luminous as our sun. The subject of [[photometry (astronomy)|photometry]] remained in its infancy until the time of [[Pierre Bouguer]] and [[Johann Heinrich Lambert]].<ref name="Mccormmach2012">{{cite book|author=Russell Mccormmach|title=Weighing the World: The Reverend John Michell of Thornhill|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9eMkgfKIdXIC&pg=PA129|accessdate=12 May 2013|date=2012|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-94-007-2022-0|pages=129–31}}</ref>
