The '''''Journal de Paris''''' (1777-1840) was the first daily French newspaper.<ref name="first1">(7 October 2014). [http://historyofjournalism.onmason.com/2014/10/07/the-first-french-daily-journal-de-paris/ The first French daily: Journal de Paris], History of Journalism</ref><ref name="andrews1">Andrews, Elizabeth.

The paper was founded by [[Antoine-Alexis Cadet de Vaux]], [[Jean Romilly]], Olivier de Corancez, and [[Louis d'Ussieux]], in 1777, following the model of the ''[[London Evening Post]]''.  The four-page daily paper eschewed politics in favor of popular culture, the weather, and other light-hearted culture, which made it the subject of jesting in its day.  Nevertheless, the model proved popular.  In 1784, the paper famously published an anonymous satirical letter by [[Benjamin Franklin]] encouraging Parisians to rise earlier in the day, which has been credited (though an overreach) with promoting the concept of [[daylight saving time]].<ref name="franklin1">[https://www.fi.edu/benjamin-franklin/daylight-savings-time Did Ben Franklin Invent Daylight Saving Time?], The Franklin Institute (Retrieved 7 June 2018)</ref>

The paper did increase its coverage of politics as dictated by French events, and was publishing a supplement in 1789 covering the [[National Assembly (French Revolution)|National Assembly]]. The paper was shut down after the [[Insurrection of 10 August 1792]] for 50 days.  With the support of [[Napoleon]], the paper expanded its format and scope in 1811.  Though it never recovered its former glory, its most well-known later writer was [[Henri Fonfrède]].<ref name="cyclo1">[https://books.google.com/books?id=uBdLAQAAMAAJ&pg=PA536#v=onepage&q&f=false The American Cyclopædia: A Popular Dictionary of General Knowledge, Volume 3], p. 536 (1881)</ref><ref name="dicunive">[https://books.google.com/books?id=c4IG-3sZQ_MC&pg=PA1537#v=onepage&q&f=false Dictionnaire universel des litteratures], entry for Paris (Journal de), p. 1537 (1876) (in French)</ref><ref name="dictttt">Sgard, Jean.
