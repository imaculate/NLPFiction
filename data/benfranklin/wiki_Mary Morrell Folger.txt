'''Mary Morrell Folger''' ({{circa|1620}}&ndash;1704) was the maternal grandmother of [[Benjamin Franklin]], a [[Founding Father]] of the [[United States]].<ref name="Payne" /> In [[Herman Melville]]'s ''[[Moby-Dick]]'' she was cited as ancestor of the Folger whalers.

==Personal life==
Folger immigrated to [[Massachusetts Bay Colony]] from [[Norwich]], England in 1635<ref name="Douglas-Lithgow p. 63" /> with Rev. [[Hugh Peter]]s and his family. She was an [[indentured servant]], working for the family as a maid<ref name="Sparks" /><ref name="Folger" /> on the same ship as [[Peter Foulger|Peter Folger]] and his parents.<ref name="Douglas-Lithgow p. 63" />  Peter Folger paid Hugh Peters the sum of 20 shillings to pay off Mary's servitude, which he declared was the best appropriation of money he had ever made.<ref name="NEHGS" /><ref name="Folger" />

She married Peter Folger in 1644.<ref name="Sparks" /> They lived in [[Watertown, Massachusetts]] before moving in 1660 to [[Martha's Vineyard]], where he was acquainted with the [[Thomas Mayhew|Mayhews]]. He was a strict teacher, surveyor, and translator for the [[Wampanoag people]].<ref name="Douglas-Lithgow p. 63" />

They had nine children. Eight of their children were born on Martha's Vineyard.<ref name="Douglas-Lithgow pp. 225-226" /> In 1663, they moved to [[Nantucket]],<ref name="Douglas-Lithgow p. 63" /> where they were among the few people of European heritage.<ref name="Sparks" /> Their youngest daughter, [[Josiah Franklin#Marriage to Abiah Folger|Abiah]] (1667–1752) was born there. She married Boston candle-maker [[Josiah Franklin]] and they had a son, [[Benjamin Franklin]].<ref name="Payne" /><ref name="Douglas-Lithgow" />

Her husband died in 1690<ref name="Douglas-Lithgow p. 63" /> and was buried at the Founders Burial Ground on Nantucket.<ref name="Founders Burial Ground" /> She died in 1704.<ref name="Sparks" />

==Legacy==
Folger was referenced in defense of the whaling industry in [[Herman Melville]]'s fictional ''[[Moby-Dick]]''.<ref name="Melville" /> In it, Melville sets up a series of objections to that industry, one of which is "No good blood in their veins?" The response is:

{{quote|They have something better than royal blood there. The grandmother of Benjamin Franklin was Mary Morrel; afterwards, by marriage, Mary Folger, one of the old settlers of Nantucket, and the ancestress to a long line of Folgers and harpooneers—all kith and kin to noble Benjamin—this day darting the barbed iron from one side of the world to the other.|Herman Melville, ''Moby-Dick''<ref name="Melville" />}}
