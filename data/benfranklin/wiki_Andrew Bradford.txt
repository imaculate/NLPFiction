==Life and career==
He was the son of a printer, and grandson of two others. He was born to [[William Bradford (1663-1752)|William]] and Elizabeth Sowle Bradford in Philadelphia. In 1692, the family moved to [[New York City|New York]], and there he learned the printing trade from his father. In 1709, Andrew Bradford was listed as a printer in New York; that year, he declined an offer from Rhode Island to become that colony's printer.<ref name=ambio />

He returned to Philadelphia in 1712 and opened his own print shop. On December 22, 1719, he began publication of ''The [[American Weekly Mercury]]''. This was the first newspaper in Philadelphia and enjoyed a wide circulation. He also taught the print business to his nephew  [[William Bradford (1719-1791)|William Bradford]] and for a time employed [[Benjamin Franklin]] when Franklin first came to Philadelphia, introduced by Bradford's father William.<ref>{{cite book|title=Oxford Dictionary of National Biography|year=2004|publisher=Oxford University Press|author=Calhoun Winton|accessdate=8 May 2013|chapter=Bradford, William (1663–1752)}}</ref> Franklin would go on to establish a rival printing press and newspaper, the ''[[Pennsylvania Gazette]]'', in Philadelphia. On February 13, 1741, Bradford published the first issue of the ''American Magazine'', the first magazine to be published in America — beating out Franklin for the honor by three days.<ref name=hist />

Throughout the 1720s, Bradford published political pamphlets critical of the local government, denouncing its "sinking credit" and supporting freedom of the press. He also published "Busy-Body" essays, criticisms of the colonial government penned by Franklin and [[Joseph Breintnall]], in the ''Mercury''. For these political actions, Bradford was brought before a council, censured several times, and jailed once.<ref name=ambio /> 
 
Bradford's first wife was Dorcas Boels, who died in 1739. Bradford then married [[Cornelia Smith Bradford|Cornelia Smith]], who took over his print shop and newspaper upon his death in 1742.<ref>{{cite book|last=De Armond|first=Anna Janney|title=Notable American Women, A Biographical Dictionary: 1607-1950 (Vol.1-3)|year=1971|publisher=Harvard University Press|location=Cambridge|isbn=9780674627345|pages=219–220|url=http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=b6h&AN=34644211&site=brc-live|accessdate=3 May 2013|chapter=BRADFORD, Cornelia Smith.}}</ref>
