'''New France''' ({{lang-fr|Nouvelle-France}}) was the area [[French colonization of the Americas|colonized]] by [[France]] in [[North America]] during a period beginning with the exploration of the [[Gulf of Saint Lawrence]] by [[Jacques Cartier]] in 1534 and ending with the cession of New France to [[Kingdom of Great Britain|Great Britain]] and [[Spain]] in 1763 under the [[Treaty of Paris (1763)]].

At its peak in 1712 (before the [[Treaty of Utrecht]]), the territory of ''New France'', also sometimes known as the ''French North American Empire'' or ''Royal New France'', consisted of five colonies, each with its own administration: [[Canada (New France)|Canada]], the most developed colony and divided into the districts [[Quebec City|Québec]], [[Trois-Rivières]] and [[Montreal|Montréal]] (before 1717, extending south through the [[Illinois Country]]); [[Hudson Bay|Hudson's Bay]]; [[Acadia|Acadie]], in the northeast; [[Placentia, Newfoundland and Labrador|Plaisance]], on the island of [[Newfoundland (island)|Newfoundland]], and [[Louisiana (New France)|Louisiane]].<ref name=Francis2009>{{cite book |first1=R. Douglas |last1=Francis |first2=Richard |last2=Jones |first3=Donald B. |last3=Smith |title=Journeys: A History of Canada |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GbbZRIOKclsC&pg=PA51 |year=2009 |publisher=Cengage Learning |isbn=0-17-644244-8 |page=51}}</ref><ref name=Territoire>{{cite web |url=http://www.culture.gouv.fr/culture/nllefce/fr/intro.htm |title=La Nouvelle France: Le Territoire |trans-title=New France: The Territory |publisher=Government of France |language=French |accessdate=16 January 2017}}</ref> (after 1717, extending north through the Illinois Country);  Thus, it extended from Newfoundland to the [[Canadian prairies]] and from Hudson Bay to the [[Gulf of Mexico]], including all the [[Great Lakes of North America]].

In the sixteenth century, the lands were used primarily to draw from the wealth of natural resources such as furs through trade with the various indigenous peoples. In the seventeenth century, successful settlements began in Acadia, and in Quebec by the efforts of Champlain. By 1765, the population of the new [[Province of Quebec (1763–91)|Province of Quebec]] reached approximately 70,000 settlers.<ref name=StatCan2009 /><ref name="Preston2009" />

The 1713 Treaty of Utrecht resulted in France relinquishing its claims to mainland Acadia, the Hudson Bay and Newfoundland to England. France established the colony of [[Cape Breton Island|Île Royale]], now called Cape Breton Island, where they built the [[Fortress of Louisbourg]].<ref name=Johnston2001>{{cite book |title=Control and Order in French Colonial Louisbourg, 1713–1758 |first=Andrew John Bayly |last=Johnston |year=2001 |publisher=MSU Press |pages=8–9 |isbn=978-0-8701-3570-5 |jstor=10.14321/j.ctt7zt68f |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JIV6AAAAMAAJ@pg=PP1}}</ref><ref name=Louisbourg>{{cite web |url=http://www.fortressoflouisbourg.ca/Overview/mid/12 |title=History |publisher=Fortress of Louisbourg Association |access-date=23 April 2015}}</ref>

Acadia had a difficult history, with the British causing the [[Expulsion of the Acadians|Great Upheaval]] with the forced expulsion of the Acadians in the period from 1755 to 1764. This has been remembered on [[Royal Proclamation of 2003|July 28]] each year since 2003. Their [[Acadians|descendants]] are dispersed in the Maritime Provinces of Canada, and in Maine and Louisiana in the United States, with small populations in [[Chéticamp, Nova Scotia]] and the [[Magdalen Islands#History|Magdalen Islands]]. Some also went to France.

In 1763, France had ceded the rest of New France, except the islands of [[Saint Pierre and Miquelon]], to Great Britain and Spain at the [[Treaty of Paris (1763)|Treaty of Paris]], which ended the [[Seven Years' War]] (known as the [[French and Indian War]] in North America and especially the United States). Britain received Canada, Acadia, and the parts of French Louisiana which lay east of the [[Mississippi River]]{{snd}}except for the [[Île d'Orléans, Louisiana|Île d'Orléans]], which was granted to Spain, along with the territory to the west{{snd}}the larger portion of Louisiana.

In 1800, Spain returned [[Louisiana (New Spain)|its portion of Louisiana]] to France under the secret [[Third Treaty of San Ildefonso|Treaty of San Ildefonso]]. However, French leader [[Napoleon Bonaparte]] in turn sold it to the [[United States]] in the [[Louisiana Purchase]] of 1803, permanently ending French colonial efforts on the North American mainland.

New France eventually became absorbed within the United States and Canada, with the only vestige remaining under French rule being the tiny islands of Saint Pierre and Miquelon. In the United States, the legacy of New France includes [[List of place names of French origin in the United States|numerous placenames]] as well as [[French language in the United States|small pockets of French-speaking communities]]. In Canada, [[Bilingualism in Canada|institutional bilingualism]] and [[Canadian identity#French Canadians and Identity in English Canada|strong Francophone identities]] are arguably the most enduring legacy of New France.

==Early exploration (1523–1650s)==
Around 1523, the [[Republic of Florence|Florentine]] navigator [[Giovanni da Verrazzano]] convinced King [[Francis I of France|Francis I]] to commission an expedition to find a western route to [[Cathay]] (China).<ref>{{cite book |first=Raymonde |last=Litalien |title=Champlain: The Birth of French America |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZnE0tjj9MbgC&pg=PA115 |year=2004 |publisher=McGill-Queen's Press |isbn=978-0-7735-7256-0 |page=115}}</ref> Late that year, Verrazzano set sail in [[Dieppe, Seine-Maritime|Dieppe]], crossing the Atlantic on a small [[caravel]] with 50 men.<ref name="CoxAlbala2009">{{cite book |first1=Caroline |last1=Cox |first2=Ken |last2=Albala |title=Opening Up North America, 1497–1800 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=75WxGsZD2DIC&pg=PA27 |year=2009 |publisher=Infobase Publishing |isbn=978-1-60413-196-3 |page=27}}</ref> After exploring the coast of the present-day [[The Carolinas|Carolinas]] early the following year, he headed north along the coast, eventually anchoring in the [[The Narrows|Narrows]] of [[New York Bay]].<ref name="CoxAlbala2009"/>

The first European to visit the site of present-day New York, Verrazzano named it [[New Angoulême|Nouvelle-Angoulême]] in honour of the [[king]], the former count of [[Angoulême]].<ref>{{cite book |first=Evan T. |last=Pritchard |title=Native New Yorkers: The Legacy of the Algonquin People of New York |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=c5hky9f5PgoC&pg=PA21 |year=2002 |publisher=Council Oak Books |isbn=978-1-57178-107-9 |page=21}}</ref> Verrazzano's voyage convinced the king to seek to establish a colony in the newly discovered land.

In 1534, [[Jacques Cartier]] planted a cross in the [[Gaspé Peninsula]] and claimed the land in the name of King Francis I.<ref name=Riendeau>{{cite book |first=Roger E. |last=Riendeau |title=A Brief History of Canada |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CFWy0EfzlX0C&pg=PA36 |year=2007 |publisher=Infobase Publishing |isbn=978-1-4381-0822-3 |page=36}}</ref> It was the first province of New France. The first settlement of 400 people, Fort [[Charlesbourg-Royal]] (present-day [[Quebec City]]), was attempted in 1541 but lasted only two years.<ref>{{cite web |title=Fort Charlesbourg Royal National Historic Site of Canada |url=https://www.historicplaces.ca/en/rep-reg/place-lieu.aspx?id=16661 |publisher=Canada's Historic Places: Parks Canada |accessdate=31 July 2018}}</ref>

French fishing fleets continued to sail to the Atlantic coast and into the St. Lawrence River, making alliances with Canadian [[First Nations]] that became important once France began to occupy the land. French merchants soon realized the St. Lawrence region was full of valuable [[fur]]-bearing animals, especially the [[American Beaver|beaver]], which were becoming rare in [[Europe]]. Eventually, the French crown decided to colonize the territory to secure and expand its influence in America.

Another early French attempt at settlement in North America took place in 1564 at [[Fort Caroline]], now [[Jacksonville, Florida]]. Intended as a haven for [[Huguenot]]s, Caroline was founded under the leadership of [[René Goulaine de Laudonnière]] and [[Jean Ribault]]. It was sacked by the [[Spain|Spanish]] led by [[Pedro Menéndez de Avilés]] who then established the settlement of [[St. Augustine, Florida|St. Augustine]] on 20 September 1565.

[[Acadia]] and [[Canada (New France)]] were inhabited by [[indigenous peoples of North America|indigenous]] nomadic [[Algonquian peoples|Algonquian]] peoples and sedentary [[Iroquoian]] peoples. These lands were full of unexploited and valuable natural resources, which attracted all of Europe. By the 1580s, French trading companies had been set up, and ships were contracted to bring back furs. Much of what transpired between the indigenous population and their European visitors around that time is not known, for lack of historical records.<ref name=Riendeau/>

Other attempts at establishing permanent settlements were also failures. In 1598, a French trading post was established on [[Sable Island]], off the coast of Acadia, but was unsuccessful. In 1600, a trading post was established at [[Tadoussac, Quebec|Tadoussac]], but only five settlers survived the winter.<ref name=Riendeau/> In 1604, a settlement was founded at [[Saint Croix Island, Maine|Île-Saint-Croix]] on Baie François ([[Bay of Fundy]]), which was moved to [[Habitation at Port-Royal|Port-Royal]] in 1605.<ref name=Riendeau/> It was abandoned in 1607, re-established in 1610, and destroyed in 1613, after which settlers moved to other nearby locations, creating settlements that were collectively known as [[Acadia]], and the settlers as [[Acadians]].<ref name=Riendeau/>

===Foundation of Quebec City (1608)===
[[File:Champlain Habitation de Quebec.jpg|thumb|left|Champlain's Habitation {{circa|1608}}]]
In 1608, King [[Henry IV of France|Henry IV]] sponsored [[Pierre Dugua, Sieur de Mons]] and [[Samuel de Champlain]] as founders of [[Quebec City|the city of Quebec]] with 28 men. This was the second permanent French settlement in the colony of [[Canada, New France|Canada]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=Grenon |first1=Jean-Yves |title=Pierre Dugua De Mons: Founder of Acadie (1604–05), Co-Founder of Quebec (1608) |translator-first=Phil |translator-last=Roberts |location=Annapolis Royal, Nova Scotia |publisher=Peninsular Press |date=2000 |isbn=978-0-9682-0162-6}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last=Liebel |first=Jean |title=Pierre Dugua, sieur de Mons, fondateur de Québec |location=Paris |publisher=Le Croît vif |date=1999 |isbn=978-2-9079-6748-8}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last=Binot |first=Guy |title=Pierre Dugua de Mons: gentilhomme royannais, premier colonisateur du Canada, lieutenant général de la Nouvelle-France de 1603 à 1612 |location=[Vaux-sur-Mer] |publisher=Bonne anse |date=2004 |isbn=978-2-9144-6313-3}}</ref> Colonization was slow and difficult. Many settlers died early because of harsh weather and diseases. In 1630, there were only 103 colonists living in the settlement, but by 1640, the population had reached 355.<ref>{{cite web |title=Estimated population of Canada, 1605 to present |url=http://www.statcan.gc.ca/pub/98-187-x/4151287-eng.htm |publisher=Statistics Canada |year=2009 |accessdate=26 August 2010}}</ref>

Champlain allied himself as soon as possible with the [[Algonquin people|Algonquin]] and [[Innu|Montagnais]] peoples in the area, who were at war with the [[Iroquois]]. In 1609, Champlain, with two French companions, accompanied his Algonquin, Montagnais, and [[Wyandot people|Huron]] allies south from the St. Lawrence valley to [[Lake Champlain]]. There he participated decisively in a battle against the Iroquois, killing two Iroquois chiefs with the first shot of his [[arquebus]]. This military engagement against the Iroquois solidified Champlain's status with New France's Huron and Algonquin allies, enabling him to maintain bonds that were essential to New France's interests in the fur trade.<ref name="Douglas Hunter 2000, pp. 240+">{{cite book |first=Douglas |last=Hunter |title=God's Mercies: Rivalry, Betrayal and the Dream of Discovery |publisher=Random House of Canada |date=2007 |pp=240–242 |isbn=978-0-3856-6058-7 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GzoSiqV--t8C&pg=PA240}}</ref>

[[File:Western New France, 1688.jpg|thumb|A map of western New France, including the [[Illinois Country]], by [[Vincenzo Coronelli]], 1688]]
Champlain also arranged to have young French men live with local indigenous people, to learn their language and customs and help the French adapt to life in North America. These ''[[coureurs des bois]]'' ("runners of the woods"), such as [[Étienne Brûlé]], extended French influence south and west to the [[Great Lakes]] and among the Huron tribes who lived there. For the better part of a century the Iroquois and French clashed in a series of attacks and reprisals.<ref name="Douglas Hunter 2000, pp. 240+"/>

During the first decades of the colony's existence, the French population numbered only a few hundred, while the [[English colonial empire|English colonies]] to the south were much more populous and wealthy. [[Cardinal Richelieu]], adviser to [[Louis XIII of France|Louis XIII]], wished to make New France as significant as the English colonies. In 1627, Richelieu founded the [[Company of One Hundred Associates]] to invest in New France, promising land parcels to hundreds of new settlers and to turn Canada into an important mercantile and farming colony.<ref name="Knecht 1991 165">{{cite book |last=Knecht |first=R.J. |title=Richelieu |year=1991 |publisher=Pearson Education Limited |location=Essex, England |isbn=0-582-43757-1 |pages=165}}</ref> Champlain was named [[Governor of New France]] and Richelieu forbade non-[[Roman Catholicism|Roman Catholics]] from living there. [[Protestants]] were required to renounce their faith prior to settling in New France; many therefore chose instead to move to the English colonies.<ref name="Knecht 1991 165"/>

The Roman Catholic Church, and missionaries such as the [[Recollets]] and the [[Society of Jesus|Jesuits]], became firmly established in the territory. Richelieu also introduced the [[Seigneurial system of New France|seigneurial system]], a semi-feudal system of farming that remained a characteristic feature of the St. Lawrence valley until the 19th century. While Richelieu's efforts did little to increase the French presence in New France, they did pave the way for the success of later efforts.<ref name="Knecht 1991 165"/>

At the same time the English colonies to the south began to raid the St. Lawrence valley and, in 1629, Quebec itself was captured and held by the English until 1632.<ref name=Michael>{{cite book |last=Fry |first=Michael |title=The Scottish Empire |publisher=Tuckwell Press |year=2001 |isbn=1-84158-259-X |page=21}}</ref> Champlain returned to Canada that year, and requested that Sieur de Laviolette found another trading post at [[Trois-Rivières, Quebec|Trois-Rivières]], which he did in 1634. Champlain died in 1635.

==Royal takeover and attempts to settle==
[[File:Naval Flag of the Kingdom of France (Civil Ensign).svg|thumb|Merchant Ensign of New France]]

In 1650, New France had seven hundred colonists and Montreal had only a few dozen settlers. Because the First Nations people did most of the work of beaver hunting, the company needed few French employees. The severely underpopulated New France almost fell completely to hostile Iroquois forces. In 1660, settler [[Adam Dollard des Ormeaux]] led a Canadian and Huron [[militia]] against a much larger Iroquois force; none of the Canadians survived, but they succeeded in turning back the Iroquois invasion. In 1627, Quebec had only eighty-five French colonists and was easily overwhelmed two years later when three English privateers plundered the settlement. In 1663, New France finally became more secure when [[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]] made it a royal province, taking control away from the [[Company of One Hundred Associates]]. In the same year the [[Société Notre-Dame de Montréal]] ceded its possessions to the [[Society of Saint-Sulpice|Seminaire de Saint-Sulpice]].<ref>{{cite book |last=Young |first=Brian |title=In Its Corporate Capacity: the Seminary of Montreal as a Business Institution, 1816–76 |location=Montreal |publisher=McGill-Queen's University Press |year=1986 |chapter=Chapter 1, Holy Housekeeping: The Company and Business Management |pages=3–37 |isbn=978-0-7735-0554-4 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lEF2PSj_S-QC@pg=PA3}}</ref> The crown stimulated emigration to New France by paying for transatlantic passages and offering other incentives to those willing to move, and the population of New France grew to three thousand.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Taylor |first1=Alan |title=American Colonies: The Settling of North America |date=2001 |publisher=Penguin Books |location=New York |isbn=978-0-14-200210-0 |pages=365–366 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NPoAQRgkrOcC&pg=PA365}}</ref>

In 1665, Louis XIV sent a French garrison, the [[Carignan-Salières Regiment]], to Quebec. The government of the colony was reformed along the lines of the government of France, with the Governor General and [[Intendant of New France|Intendant]] subordinate to the Minister of the Marine in France. In 1665, [[Jean Talon]] was sent by Minister of the Marine [[Jean-Baptiste Colbert]] to New France as the first Intendant. These reforms limited the power of the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Quebec|Bishop of Quebec]], who had held the greatest amount of power after the death of Champlain.

The [[1666 census of New France]] was conducted by France's intendant, Jean Talon, in the winter of 1665–66. It showed a population of 3,215 ''habitants'' in New France, many more than there had been only a few decades earlier, but also a great difference in the number of men (2,034) and women (1,181).<ref name = Talon>{{cite web |title=Statistics for the 1666 Census |url=http://amicus.collectionscanada.gc.ca/aaweb-bin/aamain/itemdisp?sessionKey=999999999_142&l=0&d=2&v=0&lvl=1&itm=30327415 |publisher=Library and Archives Canada |year=2006 |accessdate=24 June 2010}}</ref>

Talon tried to reform the seigneurial system, forcing the ''seigneurs'' to actually reside on their land, and limiting the size of the ''seigneuries'', in an attempt to make more land available to new settlers. These schemes were ultimately unsuccessful. Very few settlers arrived, and the various industries established by Talon did not surpass the importance of the fur trade.

===Settlers and their families===
[[File:The Arrival of the French Girls at Quebec, 1667 - C.W. Jefferys.jpg|thumb|One group of [[King's Daughters]] arrives at Quebec, 1667]]

The first settler was brought to Quebec by Champlain{{snd}}the apothecary Louis Hébert and his family, of Paris. They came expressly to settle, stay in one place to make the New France settlement function. Waves of recruits came in response to the requests for men with specific skills, like farming, apothecaries, blacksmiths. As couples married, cash incentives to have large families were put in place, and were effective.

To strengthen the colony and make it the centre of [[French colonial empire|France's colonial empire]], [[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]] decided to send single women, aged between 15 and 30 known as the [[King's Daughters]] or in French, les filles du roi, to New France, paying for their passage and granting goods or money as a dowry. Approximately 800 arrived during 1663–1673. The King's Daughters found husbands among the male settlers within a year or two, as well as a new life for themselves. They came on their own choice, many because they could not make a favorable marriage in the social hierarchy in France. They were from commoner families in the Paris area, Normandy and the central-western regions of France. By 1672, the population of New France had risen to 6,700, from 3,200 in 1663.<ref name=peupl>{{cite web |title=Le peuplement d'un pays |url=http://www.mcq.org/histoire/filles_du_roi/peuplem.html |publisher=Musée de la civilisation |year=1998}}</ref>

At the same time, marriages with the indigenous peoples were encouraged, and [[Indentured servitude|indentured servants]], known as ''engagés'', were also sent to New France. The women played a major role in establishing family life, civil society, and enabling rapid demographic growth.<ref name=Landry>{{cite journal |first=Yves |last=Landry |title=Fertility in France and New France: The Distinguishing Characteristics of Canadian Behavior in the Seventeenth and Eighteenth Centuries |work=Social Science History |date=Winter 1993 |volume=17 |issue=4 |p=586 |jstor=1171305 |doi=10.2307/1171305}}</ref> There was a high demand for children, for they contributed to the prosperity of the farm from an early age, and there was plenty of food for them. Women bore about 30% more children than comparable women who remained in France. Landry says, "Canadians had an exceptional diet for their time.

Besides household duties, some women participated in the fur trade, the major source of cash in New France. They worked at home alongside their husbands or fathers as merchants, clerks and provisioners. Some were widows who took over their husband's roles. A handful were active entrepreneurs in their own right.<ref>{{cite journal |first=Jan |last=Noel |title=N'être plus la déléguée de personne: une réévaluation du rôle des femmes dans le commerce en Nouvelle-France |work=Revue d'histoire de L'Amerique francaise |year=2009 |volume=63 |issue=2 |pages=209–241 |doi=10.7202/044453ar|url=http://www.erudit.org/fr/revues/haf/2009-v63-n2-3-haf3904/044453ar.pdf }}</ref>

===Growth of the settlements===
[[File:Fer - Le Canada, ou Nouvelle France, la Floride, la Virginie, Pensilvanie, Caroline.png|thumb|Map of Canada (New France) in 1703]]

After the Treaty of Utrecht in 1713, New France began to prosper. Industries such as fishing and farming, which had failed under Talon, began to flourish. A "King's Highway" (''[[Chemin du Roy]]'') was built between Montreal and Quebec to encourage faster trade. The shipping industry also flourished as new ports were built and old ones were upgraded. The number of colonists greatly increased. By 1720, Canada had become a self-sufficient colony with a population of 24,594 people.<ref name=Belanger>{{cite web |url=http://faculty.marianopolis.edu/c.belanger/QuebecHistory/stats/pop05-44.htm |title=Population of Quebec 1605–1844 |author=Bélanger, Claude |publisher=Marianopolis College |location=Montreal |work=Quebec History: Statistical Material and Charts |date=23 August 2000 |accessdate=25 July 2016|quote=Year 1765 Population 69,810}}</ref> The Church, although now less powerful than it had originally been, controlled education and social welfare.

===Settlements in Louisiana===

The French extended their territorial claim to the south and to the west of the [[Thirteen Colonies|American colonies]] late in the 17th century, naming it for King Louis XIV, as [[Louisiana (New France)|La Louisiane]]. In 1682, [[René-Robert Cavelier, Sieur de La Salle]] explored the [[Ohio River]] Valley and the [[Mississippi embayment|Mississippi River Valley]], and he claimed the entire territory for [[Early modern France|France]] as far south as the [[Gulf of Mexico]].<ref name="Magocsi1999w">{{cite book |first=Paul R. |last=Magocsi |title=Encyclopedia of Canada's Peoples |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dbUuX0mnvQMC&pg=PA539 |year=1999 |publisher=University of Toronto Press |isbn=978-0-8020-2938-6 |pages=539–540}}</ref> La Salle attempted to establish the first southern colony in the new territory in 1685, but inaccurate maps and navigational issues led him to instead establish his [[French colonization of Texas|Fort Saint Louis]] in what is now [[Texas]].

==Fur trade and economy==
{{Main|Beaver Wars}}
{{Further|North American fur trade}}
{{See also|List of French forts in North America}}
According to the [[staples thesis]], the economic development of New France was marked by the emergence of successive economies based on staple commodities, each of which dictated the political and cultural settings of the time. During the 16th and early 17th centuries New France's economy was heavily centered on its [[Atlantic]] fisheries. This would change in the later half of the 17th and 18th centuries as [[France|French]] settlement penetrated further into the continental interior.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Watkins |first=Melville H. |title=A Staple Theory of Economic Growth |work=The Canadian Journal of Economics and Political Science |volume=29 |issue=2 |date=May 1963 |pp=141–158 |jstor=139461 |doi=10.2307/139461}}</ref> Here French economic interests would shift and concentrate itself on the development of the [[North American fur trade]]. It would soon become the new staple good that would strengthen and drive New France's economy, in particular that of [[Montreal]], for the next century.

[[File:Beaver wars map.jpg|thumb|upright=1.25|Map showing the approximate location of major tribes and settlements<ref>{{cite book |last=Jennings |first=Francis |title=The Ambiguous Iroquois Empire |year=1984 |isbn=0-393-01719-2 |publisher=W.

The trading post of [[Ville-Marie, Montreal|Ville-Marie]], established on the current island of Montreal, quickly became the economic hub for the French fur trade. It achieved this in great part due to its particular location along the [[St. Lawrence River]]. From here a new economy emerged, one of size and density that provided increased economic opportunities for the inhabitants of New France. In December 1627 the [[Company of New France]] was recognized and given commercial rights to the gathering and export of [[furs]] from French territories.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Adair |first=E. R. |url=http://www.erudit.org/revue/ram/1942/v21/n1/300228ar.pdf |title=The Evolution of Montreal under the French Regime |work=Report of the Annual Meeting of the Canadian Historical Association |volume=21 |issue=1 |date=1942 |pp=20–41 |doi=10.7202/300228ar}}</ref> By trading with various indigenous populations and securing the main markets its power grew steadily for the next decade. As a result, it was able to set specific price points for furs and other valuable goods, often doing so to protect its economic hegemony over other trading partners and other areas of the economy.

The fur trade itself was based on a [[commodity]] of small bulk but yet high value. Because of this it managed to attract increased attention and/or input capital that would otherwise be intended for other areas of the economy. The Montreal area witnessed a stagnant agricultural sector; it remained for the most part subsistence orientated with little or no trade purposes outside of the French [[colony]]. This was a prime example of the handicapping effect the [[fur trade]] had on its neighbouring areas of the [[economy]].<ref>{{cite journal |last=Innis |first=H.A. |url=http://www.utpjournals.press/doi/abs/10.3138/CHR-018-04-02?journalCode=chr |title=Significant Factors in Canadian Economic Development |work=Canadian Historical Review |volume=18 |issue=4 |date=1937 |pp=374–84 |doi=10.3138/CHR-018-04-02}}</ref>

Nonetheless, by the beginning of the 1700s the economic prosperity the fur trade stimulated slowly transformed Montreal. Economically, it was no longer a town of small traders or of fur fairs but rather a city of merchants and of bright lights. The primary sector of the [[fur trade]], the act of acquiring and the selling of the furs, quickly promoted the growth of complementary second and tertiary sectors of the economy. For instance a small number of tanneries was established in Montreal as well as a larger number of inns, taverns and markets that would support the growing number of inhabitants whose livelihood depended on the fur trade. Already by 1683 there were well over 140 families and there may have been as many as 900 people living in Montreal.

The founding of the [[Compagnie des Indes]] in 1718, once again highlighted the economic importance of the fur trade.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Wien |first=Thomas |url=http://www.erudit.org/revue/jcha/1990/v1/n1/031021ar.pdf |title=Selling Beaver Skins in North America and Europe, 1720–1760: The Uses of Fur-Trade Imperialism |work=Journal of the Canadian Historical Association |volume=1 |issue=1 |date=1990 |pp=293–317 |doi=10.7202/031021ar}}</ref> This merchant association, like its predecessor the Compagnie des Cent Associes, regulated the fur trade to the best of its abilities imposing price points, supporting government sale taxes and combating black market practices. However, by the middle half of the 18th century the [[fur trade]] was in a slow decline.<ref name = "illegalfurtrade">{{citejournal |last=Lunn |first=Jean |url=http://www.erudit.org/revue/ram/1939/v18/n1/300187ar.pdf |title=The Illegal Fur Trade out of New France, 1713–60 |journal=Report of the Annual Meeting of the Canadian Historical Association / Rapports annuels de la Société historique du Canada |volume=18 |number=1 |year=1939 |pages=61–76 |issn=0317-0594 |accessdate=20 February 2012 |doi=10.7202/300187ar}}</ref>

The natural abundance of furs had passed and it could no longer meet market demand. This eventually resulted in the repeal of the 25 percent sales tax that had previously aimed at curbing the administrative costs New France had accumulated. In addition, dwindling supply increased black market trading. A greater number of indigenous groups and fur traders began circumventing [[Montreal]] and New France altogether; many began trading with either [[United Kingdom|British]] or [[Netherlands|Dutch]] merchants to the south.<ref name = "illegalfurtrade"/>

By the end of French rule in New France in 1763, the fur trade had significantly lost its importance as the key stable good that supported much of New France's economy for more than the last century. Even so, it did serve as the fundamental force behind the establishment and vast growth of Montreal and the French colony.

===Coureurs des bois and voyageurs===
[[File:Arrival of Radisson in an Indian camp 1660 Charles William Jefferys.jpg|thumb|The arrival of [[Pierre-Esprit Radisson|Radisson]] in an Amerindian camp in 1660]]
The [[coureurs des bois]] were responsible for starting the flow of trade from [[Montreal]], carrying [[France|French]] goods into upper territories while indigenous people were bringing down their [[furs]]. The coureurs traveled with intermediate trading tribes, and found that they were anxious to prevent French access to the more distant fur-hunting tribes. Still, the coureurs kept thrusting outwards using the [[Ottawa River]] as their initial step upon the journey and keeping Montreal as their starting point.<ref name="Rich, E. E. 1966"/> The Ottawa River was significant because it offered a route that was practical for Europeans, by taking the traders northward out of the territory dominated by the [[Iroquois]]. It was for this reason that Montreal and the Ottawa River was a central location of indigenous warfare and rivalry.

Montreal faced difficulties by having too many coureurs out in the woods. The furs coming down were causing an oversupply on the markets of [[Europe]]. This challenged the coureurs trade because they so easily evaded controls, monopolies, and taxation, and additionally because the coureurs trade was held to debauch both French and various indigenous groups. The coureur debauched Frenchmen by accustoming them to fully live with indigenous, and indigenous by trading on their desire for alcohol.<ref name="Rich, E. E. 1966"/>

The issues caused a great rift in the [[colony]], and in 1678, it was confirmed by a General Assembly that the trade was to be made in public so as to better assure the safety of the indigenous population. It was also forbidden to take spirits inland to trade with indigenous groups. However these restrictions on the coureurs, for a variety of reasons, never worked. The [[fur trade]] remained dependent on spirits, and increasingly in the hands of the coureurs who journeyed north in search of furs.<ref name="Rich, E. E. 1966"/>

As time passed, the Coureurs des bois were partially replaced by licensed fur trading endeavors, and the main canoe travel workers of those endeavors were called [[voyageurs]].

===Indigenous peoples===
The [[French people|French]] were interested in exploiting the land through the fur trade as well as the timber trade later on. Despite having tools and guns, the French settlers were dependent on Indigenous people to survive in the difficult climate in this part of North America. Many settlers did not know how to survive through the winter; the Indigenous people showed them how to survive in the New World. They showed the settlers how to hunt for food and to use the furs for clothing that would protect them during the winter months.<ref>{{cite book |last=Friders |first=James S. |title=Native Peoples in Canada: Contemporary Conflicts |location=Scarborough: Ontario |publisher=Prentice-Hall Canada |date=1993 |isbn=978-0-1301-2204-9}}</ref>

As the fur trade became the dominant economy in the New World, French voyageurs, trappers and hunters often married or formed relationships with Indigenous women. This allowed the French to develop relations with their wives' Indigenous nations, which in turn provided protection and access to their hunting and trapping grounds.

The fur trade benefited Indigenous people as well. They traded furs for metal tools and other European made items that made their lives easier. Tools such as knives, pots and kettles, nets, firearms and hatchets improved the general welfare of indigenous peoples. At the same time, while everyday life became easier, some traditional ways of doing things were abandoned or altered, and while Indigenous people embraced many of these implements and tools, they also were exposed to less vital trade goods, such as alcohol and sugar, sometimes with deleterious effect.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Carlos |first1=Ann M. |last2=Lewis |first2=Frank D. |title=Commerce by Frozen Sea: Native Americans and the European Fur Trade |location=Philadelphia |publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press |year=2010 |isbn= 0812204824|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wjc34n1z8pYC&pg=PP1}}</ref>

Since [[Henry Hudson]] had claimed [[Hudson Bay]], and the surrounding lands for England in 1611, English colonists had begun expanding their boundaries across what is now the [[Canada|Canadian]] north beyond the French-held territory of New France. In 1670, King Charles II of England issued a charter to Prince Rupert and "the Company of Adventurers of England trading into Hudson Bay" for an English monopoly in harvesting furs in [[Rupert's Land]], a portion of the land draining into [[Hudson Bay]]. This is the start of the [[Hudson's Bay Company]], ironically aided by French ''coureurs des bois'', [[Pierre-Esprit Radisson]] and [[Médard des Groseilliers]], frustrated with French license rules.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.hbcheritage.ca/content/timeline |title=Hudson's Bay Company is born May 2, 1670 |publisher=HBC Heritage, Hudson's Bay Company |access-date=14 November 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.hbcheritage.ca/hbcheritage/history/people/explorers/radisson.asp |title=Explorers: Radisson and des Groseilliers |publisher=HBC Heritage, Hudson's Bay Company |access-date=14 November 2013}}</ref><ref name=Fuchs>{{cite journal |first=Denise |last=Fuchs |title=Embattled Notions: Constructions of Rupert's Land's Native Sons, 1760 To 1861 |url=http://www.mhs.mb.ca/docs/mb_history/44/embattlednotions.shtml |work=Manitoba History |publisher=Manitoba Historical Society |date=March 2002 |volume=44 |pp=10–17 |issn=0226-5044}}</ref> Now both France and England were formally in the Canadian fur trade.<ref name="Our History: People">{{cite web |url=http://www.hbcheritage.ca/hbcheritage/history/people/explorers/samuelhearne.asp |title=Our History: People - Samuel Hearne |accessdate=14 November 2007 |publisher=HBC Heritage, Hudson's Bay Company}}</ref>

===The economy of ''La Louisiane''===
The major commercial importance of the Louisiana Purchase territory was the Mississippi River. New Orleans, the largest and most important city in the territory, was the most commercial city in the United States until the Civil War, with most jobs there being related to trade and shipping; there was little manufacturing. The first commercial shipment to come down the Mississippi River was of deer and bear hides in 1705.<ref name=GarveyWidmer>

The French (later Spanish) Louisiana Territory was owned by France for a number of years before the money-losing territory was transferred to French banker Antoine Crozat in 1713 for 15 years. After losing four times his investment, Crozat gave up his charter in 1717. Control of Louisiana and its 700 inhabitants was given to the Company of the Indies in 1719. The company conducted a major settlement program by recruiting European settlers to locate in the territory. Unemployed persons, convicts and prostitutes were also sent to the Louisiana Territory. After the bankruptcy of the company in 1720, control was returned to the king.<ref name=GarveyWidmer/><ref>{{cite book |first=Glenn R. |last=Conrad |title=The French Experience in Louisiana |publisher=Center for Louisiana Studies, University of Southwestern Louisiana |date=1995 |isbn=978-0-9409-8497-4 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Hkl5AAAAMAAJ&pg=PP1}}</ref>

Louis XV saw no value in Louisiana, and in order to bring about an end to the [[Seven Years' War]], he transferred Louisiana to his cousin Charles III of Spain in 1763. Louisiana remained under the control of Spain until it was demanded to be turned over to France by Napoleon. Although Louisiana was property of France by the [[Third Treaty of San Ildefonso]] in 1800, Louisiana continued to be administered by Spain until the [[Louisiana Purchase]] in 1803. Following the Louisiana purchase, the population of the subsequently divided territory that contained most of present-day Louisiana tripled between 1803 and Louisiana statehood in 1812.

The presence of Jesuit missionaries in Huron society was nonnegotiable. The Huron  relied on French goods to facilitate life and warfare. Because the French would refuse trade to all indigenous societies that denied relations with missionaries, the Huron  had more of a propensity towards Christian conversion.<ref name="Seeman 2011 95">{{cite book |first=Erik R. |last=Seeman |title=The Huron-Wendat Feast of the Dead: Indian-European Encounters in Early North America |location=Baltimore |publisher=The Johns Hopkins University Press |year=2011 |page=95 |isbn=978-0-8018-9854-9 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pY-4vfAXRrwC&pg=PA95 |ref=harv}}</ref> The Huron  heavily relied on European goods to perform burial ceremonies known as [[The Huron Feast of the Dead]].

Jesuit missionaries explored the Mississippi River, in the territory of the Illinois.

Although Spanish trade goods had reached most of the indigenous peoples, these were the first Frenchmen to connect in the area named for the [[Illinois Confederation|Illinois]], including the [[Kaskaskia]].

By 1649, both the Jesuit mission and the Huron society were almost destroyed by [[French and Iroquois Wars|Iroquois invasions]] (see [[Canadian Martyrs]]). In 1653, a peace invitation was extended by the [[Iroquois|Onondaga Nation]], one of the five nations of the [[Iroquois Confederacy]]. to New France and an expedition of Jesuits, led by [[Simon Le Moyne]], established [[Sainte Marie among the Iroquois|Sainte Marie de Ganentaa]] in 1656.

Since 1640, a Seneschal (''sénéchal''), a Judge (''juge d'épée'', which literally means 'sword-bearing judge'), and a jurisdiction in [[Trois-Rivières]] were created.<ref name="Lareau 244"/> However, the Seneschal was under the oversight by the Governor, hence the Governor still had rather extensive control over legal matters in New France.<ref name="Lareau 244"/> In 1651, the [[Company of New France]] made the Great Seneschal (''Grand Sénéchal'') the chief justice.<ref name="Lareau 244"/> However, the [[Island of Montreal]] had its special Governor at that time, who also administered justice on the Island, and had not handed over justice to the Grand Seneschal until 1652.{{sfnp|Lareau|1881|page=246}}

In practice, though, the Great Seneschal was awarded as an honorary title to the son of [[Jean de Lauson]], then Governor of New France; judicial functions were in fact carried out by the Seneschal's deputies.{{sfnp|Lareau|1881|page=245}} These deputies included such officials as the civil and criminal lieutenant general (''lieutenant général civil et criminel''), the special lieutenant (''lieutenant particulier'', acting as assistant royal judge), and the lieutenant fiscal (''lieutenant fiscal'', acting as tax magistrate).{{sfnp|Lareau|1881|page=245}}

The Civil and Criminal Lieutenant General sat as judge in trials at first instance, whereas appeals would be adjudicated by the Governor, who held the sovereign right to settle final appeals on behalf of the French king. The Great Seneschal also had a magistrate in [[Trois-Rivières]], as well as a [[bailiff]] formed by the [[Society of Priests of Saint Sulpice]] on the [[Island of Montreal]].{{sfnp|Lareau|1881|p=}}

Apart from judicial responsibilities, the Great Seneschal was also in charge of convening local nobility in New France, as well as issuing declarations of war if necessary.{{sfnp|Lareau|1881|page=246}} However, such alternative role of the Great Seneschal was much weakened soon after by having the rights to declare war and to administer finances stripped off from the office because the French crown feared that colonial officers held too much authority.{{sfnp|Lareau|1881|page=246}}

===Legal Reforms 1663===

====Royal judges and the Sovereign Council====
On 13 October 1663, the royal court replaced the Seneschal Office (''sénéchaussée''). Canada was divided into three districts: the district of Quebec City, the district of [[Trois-Rivières]], and the district of [[Montreal]].{{sfnp|Lareau|1881|page=247}} Each district had its own separate jurisdiction with a judge appointed by the Crown, known as the civil and criminal lieutenants general.{{sfnp|Lareau|1881|page=247}} They were responsible for all legal matters, civil and criminal, in each of the districts.{{sfnp|Lareau|1881|page=247}}

In addition to the royal judges, there were other judicial officers in each district. The clerk of court (registrar) was responsible for transcribing all court proceedings as well as other documents relevant to each of the cases.{{sfnp|Lareau|1881|p=}} The king's attorney (''procureur du roi'') was responsible for inquiring into the facts and preparing the case against the accused.{{sfnp|Lareau|1881|page=249}} In the districts of Quebec City and Montreal, the royal judges had special lieutenants to substitute them whenever they were absent or sick.{{sfnp|Lareau|1881|page=249}} Feudal courts heard minor cases.<ref>{{cite book |first=W.J. |last=Eccles |title=The French in North America (1500–1783) |location=East Lansing, Michigan |publisher=Michigan State University Press |date=1998 |p=80 |isbn=978-1-5504-1076-1}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.champlain2004.org/html/08/08_e.html |title=Exhibitions/Administration/The Administration of Justice |publisher=Champlain2004.org |accessdate=30 June 2010}}</ref>

The reform also brought the [[Sovereign Council of New France]] (''Conseil souverain'') into existence, which was later renamed the Superior Council (''Conseil supérieur''). The Sovereign Council effectively acted as the functional equivalent of a Council of State (''Conseil d'État'') for New France, having the authority to hand down verdicts on final appeal.{{sfnp|Lareau|1881|page=248}} Initially, the Council convened once every week, and the quorum of the Sovereign Council was seven for criminal matters, or five for civil cases.{{sfnp|Lareau|1881|page=248}} The Council's practices evolved over time. At the Sovereign Council there was a king's attorney-general (''procureur général du roi'') in charge of the similar tasks as the district king's attorneys.{{sfnp|Lareau|1881|page=251}} He was also responsible for supervising the king's attorneys' daily operations as well as execution of royal edicts and regulations passed by the Council in their respective districts.{{sfnp|Lareau|1881|page=252}}

====The Custom of Paris====
{{Main|The Custom of Paris in New France}}
In 1664, the [[The Custom of Paris in New France|Custom of Paris]] (''coutume de Paris'') was formally set as the main source of law for civil law in France's overseas empire. All royal judges and king's attorneys in New France had to be thoroughly familiar with this compilation of rules.{{sfnp|Lareau|1881|page=248}} The Custom governed various civil aspects of the daily life in New France, including property, marriage, inheritance, and so on.

=====Montreal Island: transition from feudal justice to royal justice=====
The [[Island of Montreal]] was a special case because its judiciary had been previously held by the Society of St-Sulpice. In 1663, Governor-General of New France [[Augustin de Saffray de Mésy]] originally considered appointing [[Paul de Chomedey, Sieur de Maisonneuve]] the Governor of the Island of Montreal and consolidating a royal jurisdiction on the island, but the plan garnered the [[Society of Priests of Saint Sulpice|St-Sulpicians]]' disapproval, who held the Island as its own [[fief]]dom and effectively acted as the island's governor.{{sfnp|Lareau|1881|page=253}} In other words, the [[Sovereign Council of New France|Sovereign Council]] had not been able to seize effective control over the legal matters of the Island; instead, the [[Society of Priests of Saint Sulpice|St-Sulpicians]] administered justice on the island.

It was not until 16 September 1666, that the St-Sulpicians finally handed over the justice of the Island of Montreal to the Intendant of New France.{{sfnp|Lareau|1881|page=254}} In 1693, the French king commanded the replacement of the ecclesiastical courts in Montreal with a royal court composed of one royal judge, with appeals going to the [[Sovereign Council of New France|Sovereign Council]]. The introduction of a royal court on the Montreal Island also resulted in the abolition of the feudal court in the fief of [[Trois-Rivières]] (then held by the [[Jesuits]]).{{sfnp|Lareau|1881|page=261}}

=====Quebec: founding of the Provostry of Quebec=====
In the Quebec City district, the lower court (''tribunal antérieur'') was established in 1664 and had jurisdiction to try cases at first instance, but then it was abolished in 1674.{{sfnp|Lareau|1881|page=264}} The Sovereign Council appointed trial judges (''juges inférieurs'') to adjudicate cases at first instance until the [[Provost (civil)|Provost]]ry of Quebec (''prévôté de Québec'') was created in May 1677.

The Provostry of Quebec was located in the Hall of Justice (''palais de justice'') in Quebec City and had only one royal judge, also known as the civil and criminal lieutenant general of Quebec City, who heard both civil and criminal cases, as well as district police.{{sfnp|Lareau|1881|page=264}} Additionally, a court clerk and a king's attorney were appointed to the court; if either of these two officers could not attend the trials due to illness or other untenable circumstances, the Intendant would appoint a temporary substitute.{{sfnp|Lareau|1881|page=264}}

===Criminal Justice===
{{Main|Criminal Justice in New France}}
In the early stages of French colonization, the execution of criminal justice in New France were rather arbitrary. The [[Governor of New France]] served as the judge to the colonists as well as soldiers. He would announce his verdict at the presence of the chiefs of the Company of One Hundred Associates and that would be final.{{sfnp|Lareau|1881|page=286}}

After the Sovereign Council was established in Quebec in 1663, the Council carried out criminal justice according to the general ordinances of France.{{sfnp|Lareau|1881|page=286}} In 1670, the [[Criminal Ordinance of 1670|Criminal Ordinance]] was enacted in New France by order of the French king as a codification of the previous criminal laws passed by the [[Sovereign Council of New France|Sovereign Council]].{{sfnp|Lareau|1881|page=282}}

===Special courts===
====Ecclesiastical court====
{{Redirect|Officialité (New France)|the ecclesiastical court|Ecclesiastical court}}
The ecclesiasitical court (''tribunal ecclésiastique'', or ''Officialité'') was a special court for hearing first instance trials on both religious and secular affairs involving members of the Church.<ref name=":1">{{Cite web|url=http://www.justice.gouv.qc.ca/francais/ministere/histoire/structures.htm#Anchor-LE-45838|title=Les structure judiciaire dans la justice sous le Régime français|date=|access-date=|website=Justice Québec|publisher=|last=|first=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303232947/http://www.justice.gouv.qc.ca/Francais/ministere/histoire/structures.htm#Anchor-LE-45838|archivedate=3 March 2016|df=dmy-all}}</ref> It first appeared in around 1660 but was not officially recognized by state authorities for it was not administered by a bishop, until 1684.<ref name=":1" /> Appeals from this court lay with the Sovereign Council.<ref name=":1" />

====Admiralty court====
{{Redirect|Amirauté (New France)|the admiralty|Admiralty}}
The court of admiralty was created in 12 January 1717 and was the last judicial body set up in Canada during the French colonial period.{{sfnp|Lareau|1881|page=268}} The court had a judge (also known as the lieutenant-general of the court) appointed by the French admiralty, a king's attorney, a clerk of court, and one or two bailiffs (''hussiers'').{{sfnp|Lareau|1881|page=269}} The admiralty court was located in Quebec City and had jurisdiction over all of New France except [[Louisiana]] and [[Fortress of Louisbourg|Louisbourg]].<ref name=":1" /> The court heard first instance trials on maritime affairs, including commerce and seamen's conduct.<ref name=":1" /> During wartime, it also commanded maritime police.<ref name=":1" /> Before 1717, the Quebec Provostry  performed the duties of the admiralty court.<ref name=":1" />

===Acadia===
Unlike Canada, [[Acadia]]'s judicial system was somewhat under-developed during the New France period. Prior to 1670, [[Acadia]] was in a state of being torn between various European colonists. None of the countries—France, England, the Netherlands—were able to put in place a stable jurisdiction there.

In 1670, France regained control of Acadia and appointed Mathieu de Goutin as the Civil and Criminal Lieutenant (''lieutenant civil et criminel'') of Acadia.<ref>{{Cite book |title=Lieutenant Civil et Criminel: Mathieu de Goutin en Acadie Française (1688–1710) |last=Vanderlinden |first=Jacques |publisher=Chaire d'études acadiennes, Université de Moncton |year=2004 |isbn=978-0-9192-4116-9 |location=Moncton, New Brunswick |page=28 |ref=harv}}</ref> Simultaneously, the [[Governor of Acadia]] was set up and his job was primarily the defense of [[Acadia]] from [[New England|English invasion]].{{sfnp|Vanderlinden|2004|page=55}} The Civil and Criminal Lieutenant was essentially supervised by the Governor, who held superior judicial authority over the Lieutenant, but for most of the time would let the Lieutenant mediate and decide legal affairs.{{sfnp|Vanderlinden|2004|page=201}}

Due to the situation in [[Acadia]] as a small settlement of around 399 settlers in 1670-71, vulnerable to foreign invasion, courts were minimal, consisting of only a Civil and Criminal Lieutenant and a king's attorney.{{sfnp|Vanderlinden|2004|page=55}} There was not an official court in [[Acadia]], although the king's attorney of Acadia performed very similar duties as his counterpart in New France.{{sfnp|Vanderlinden|2004|page=69}} Yet since [[Acadia]] never actually had a court, there was no clerk of court; instead, trials were recorded by a local [[Civil law notary|notary]].{{sfnp|Vanderlinden|2004|page=69}} It is difficult to trace the judicial history of French Acadia as the relevant archives were destroyed in a fire in 1708.{{sfnp|Vanderlinden|2004|page=69}}

==Military conflicts==
{{Main|French and Indian Wars|Father Rale's War|Father Le Loutre's War}}
{{Further|Military of New France}}

The presence of settlers, of businesses from several European countries harvesting furs, along with the interests of the indigenous people in this new competition for North American resources set the scene for significant military conflicts among all parties in New France beginning in 1642, and ending with the Seven Years' War, 1756–1763.

===Iroquois attacks against Montreal===
[[File:Battle of Long Sault 1660.jpg|thumb|Engraving depicting Adam Dollard with a keg of gunpowder above his head, during the [[Battle of Long Sault]] ]]

[[Ville-Marie, Quebec|Ville-Marie]] was a noteworthy site for it was the center of defense against the [[Iroquois]], the point of departure for all western and northern journeys, and the meeting point to which the trading Indians brought their annual furs. This placed Ville-Marie, later known as [[Montreal]], at the forefront against the [[Iroquois]], which resulted in its trade being easily and frequently interrupted. The Iroquois were in alliance with the Dutch and English,<ref name="Inc.2010">{{cite book |title=Native Peoples of the Americas |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1dqbAAAAQBAJ&pg=PA99 |year=2010 |publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc. |isbn=978-1-61535-365-1 |page=99}}</ref> which allowed them to interrupt the French fur trade and send the furs down the [[Hudson River]] to the Dutch and English traders.<ref name="Rich, E.

This also put the Iroquois at warfare against the [[Hurons]], the [[Algonquians]], and any other tribes that were in alliance with the French.

[[Adam Dollard des Ormeaux]], a colonist and soldier of New France, was a notable figure regarding the Iroquois attacks against Montreal. The Iroquois soon resumed their assaults against Montreal, and the few settlers of Montreal fell almost completely to hostile Iroquois forces. In the spring of 1660, Adam Dollard des Ormeaux led a small militia consisting of 16 men from Montreal against a much larger Iroquois force at the [[Battle of Long Sault]] on the [[Ottawa River]].<ref name="Gough2010n">{{cite book |first=Barry M. |last=Gough |title=Historical Dictionary of Canada |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=z4xK6CasigkC&pg=PR27 |year=2010 |publisher=Scarecrow Press |isbn=978-0-8108-7504-3 |page=27}}</ref> They succeeded in turning back the Iroquois invasion and are responsible for saving Montreal from destruction.<ref name="Del?geBrierley2011">{{cite book |first=Denys |last=Delâge |others=translated by [[Jane Brierley]] |title=Bitter Feast: Amerindians and Europeans in Northeastern North America, 1600–64 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2v8DLEbNkPIC&pg=PA277 |year=1995 |publisher=UBC Press |isbn=978-0-7748-4282-2 |page=277}}</ref> The encounter between Ormeaux and the Iroquois is of significance because it dissuaded the Iroquois from further attacks against Montreal.<ref>{{cite book |last=Wilson |first=Keith |year=1980 |title=Fur Trade In Canada: Focus On Canadian History Series |location=Toronto |publisher=Grolier Limited}}</ref>

===King William's War===
{{Main|King William's War}}
[[File:QueenAnnesWarBefore.svg|thumb|Map of [[North America]] in 1702 showing forts, towns and (in solid colors) areas occupied by European settlements]]

In 1688, [[King William's War]] began and the English and Iroquois launched a major assault on New France, after many years of small skirmishes throughout the English and French territories. New France and the [[Wabanaki Confederacy]] were able to thwart New England expansion into Acadia, whose border New France defined as the [[Kennebec River]] in southern Maine.<ref name=Williamson>{{cite book |first=William Durkee |last=Williamson |title=The history of the state of Maine |volume=Vol. II |publisher=Glazier, Masters & Co |date=1832 |p=27 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=670rAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA27}}</ref><ref name=Griffiths>{{cite book |last=Griffiths |first=N.E.S. |title=From Migrant to Acadian |publisher=McGill-Queen's University Press |date=2005 |p=61 |isbn=0-7735-2699-4 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cG4wSmIlziYC&pg=PA61}}</ref><ref name=Campbell>{{cite book |last=Campbell |first=William Edward |title=The Road to Canada: The Grand Communications Route from Saint John to Quebec |publisher=Goose Lane Editions and The New Brunswick Heritage Military Project |date=2005 |p=21 |isbn=978-0-8649-2426-1}}</ref> [[King William's War]] ended in 1697, but a second war ([[Queen Anne's War]]) broke out in 1702. Quebec survived the English invasions of both these wars, and during the wars France seized many of the English [[Hudson's Bay Company]] fur trading centres on [[Hudson Bay]] including [[York Factory]], which the French renamed ''Fort Bourbon''.

===Queen Anne's War===
{{Main|Queen Anne's War}}

While Acadia survived the English invasion during [[King William's War]], the colony fell during Queen Anne's War. The final [[Siege of Port Royal (1710)|Conquest of Acadia]] happened in 1710. In 1713, peace came to New France with the [[Treaty of Utrecht (1713)|Treaty of Utrecht]].<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7EBKOCt_P0EC&pg=PA62 |title=Blooding at Great Meadows: young George Washington and the battle that Shaped the Man |first=Alan |last=Axelrod |publisher=Running Press |page=62 |year=2007 |isbn=0-7624-2769-8}}</ref> Although the treaty turned Hudson Bay, [[Newfoundland (island)|Newfoundland]] and part of [[Acadia]] (peninsular [[Nova Scotia]]) over to Great Britain, France remained in control of [[Île Royale (New France)|Île Royale]] ([[Cape Breton Island]]) (which also administered Île Saint-Jean ([[Prince Edward Island]])). The northern part of [[Acadia]], what is today [[New Brunswick]] and [[Maine]], remained contested territory. Construction of [[Fortress Louisbourg]] on Île Royale, a French military stronghold intended to protect the approaches to the St. Lawrence River settlements, began in 1719.<ref>{{cite web |title=History of Louisbourg |url=http://www.fortressoflouisbourg.ca/Overview/mid/12 |publisher=The Fortress Louisbourg Association |year=2008 |accessdate=9 June 2010}}</ref>

===Father Rale's War===
{{Main|Father Rale's War}}
[[File:Death of Father Sebastian Rale of the Society of Jesus.jpg|thumb|An 1850s depiction of the death of the French [[Jesuit]] priest [[Sébastien Rale]] during [[Father Rale's War]] ]]

In Acadia, however, war continued. [[Father Rale's War]] (1722–1725) was a series of battles between New England and the [[Wabanaki Confederacy]], who were allied with New France. New France and the Wabanaki Confederacy defended against the expansion of New England settlements into Acadia, whose border New France defined as the [[Kennebec River]] in southern Maine.<ref name=Williamson/><ref name=Griffiths/><ref name=Campbell/> After the New England [[Siege of Port Royal (1710)|Conquest of Acadia]] in 1710, mainland Nova Scotia was under the control of New England, but both present-day [[New Brunswick]] and virtually all of present-day Maine remained contested territory between New England and New France. To secure New France's claim to the region, it established [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] missions among the three largest indigenous villages in the region: one on the Kennebec River ([[Norridgewock]]); one further north on the [[Penobscot River]] ([[Penobscot Indian Island Reservation|Penobscot]]) and one on the [[Saint John River (Bay of Fundy)|Saint John River]] ([[Meductic Indian Village / Fort Meductic|Medoctec]]).<ref>{{CRHP|14831|Meductic Indian Village / Fort Meductic National Historic Site of Canada |20 December 2011}}</ref><ref name=Grenier>{{cite book |first=John |last=Grenier |title=The Far Reaches of Empire: War in Nova Scotia, 1710–1760 |publisher=University of Oklahoma Press |date=2008 |p=51, 54 |isbn=978-0-8061-3876-3 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jVG5h6G5fWMC&pg=PA51}}</ref>

The war began on two fronts: when New England pushed its way through Maine and when New England established itself at [[Canso, Nova Scotia]]. As a result of the war, Maine fell to the New Englanders with the defeat of Father [[Sébastien Rale]] at Norridgewock and the subsequent retreat of the indigenous peoples from the Kennebec and Penobscot rivers to [[Saint-François-du-Lac, Quebec|St. Francis]] and [[Bécancour, Quebec|Becancour, Quebec]].{{efn|While New Englanders safely settled the land, not until the treaty of 1752 did Massachusetts officially lay claim to the entire Penobscot watershed, and in 1759, the Pownall Expedition, led by Governor [[Thomas Pownall]], established [[Fort Pownall]] on [[Cape Jellison]] in what is now [[Stockton Springs, Maine|Stockton Springs]].}}

===King George's War===
{{Main|King George's War}}

Peace lasted in Canada until 1744, when news of the outbreak of the [[War of the Austrian Succession]] ([[King George's War]] in North America) reached Fort Louisbourg. The French forces went on the attack first in a failed attempt to capture [[Annapolis Royal]], the capital of the British Nova Scotia. In 1745, [[William Shirley]], governor of [[Massachusetts]], led a counterattack on Louisbourg. Both France and New France were unable to relieve the siege, and Louisbourg fell to the British. With the famed [[Duc d'Anville Expedition]], France attempted to retake Acadia and the fortress in 1746 but failed. The fortress was returned to France under the [[Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle (1748)|Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle]], but the peace treaty, which restored all colonial borders to their pre-war status, did little to end the lingering enmity between France, Britain, and their respective colonies, nor did it resolve any territorial disputes.

===Father Le Loutre's War===
{{Main|Father Le Loutre's War}}

Within Acadia and Nova Scotia, [[Father Le Loutre's War]] (1749–1755) began with the British founding of [[Halifax Regional Municipality|Halifax]]. During Father Le Loutre's War, New France established three forts along the border of present-day [[New Brunswick]] to protect it from a New England attack from Nova Scotia. The war continued until British [[Battle of Fort Beauséjour|victory at Fort Beausejour]], which dislodged Father Le Loutre from the region, thereby ending his alliance with the Maliseet, [[Acadians]] and [[Mi'kmaq]].<ref name=Grenier/>

===French and Indian War===
{{Main|French and Indian War|Expulsion of the Acadians}}
[[File:Nouvelle-France map-en.svg|thumb|Map of territorial claims in [[North America]] by 1750, before the [[French and Indian War]], which was part of the greater worldwide conflict known as the [[Seven Years' War]] (1756 to 1763). Possessions of Britain (pink), France (blue), and Spain (orange, ''California, Pacific Northwest, and Great Basin not indicated'')]]

[[Fort Duquesne]], located at the confluence of the [[Allegheny River|Allegheny]] and [[Monongahela River]]s at the site of present-day [[Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania]], guarded the most important strategic location in the west at the time of the Seven Years' War. It was built to ensure that the [[Ohio River]] valley remained under French control. A small colonial force from Virginia began a fort here, but a French force under [[Claude-Pierre Pécaudy de Contrecœur]] drove them off in April 1754. New France claimed this as part of their colony, and the French were anxious to keep the British from encroaching on it. The French built Fort Duquesne here to serve as a military stronghold and as a base for developing trade and strengthening military alliances with the indigenous peoples of the area.

In 1755, General [[Edward Braddock]] led [[Braddock Expedition|an expedition]] against Fort Duquesne, and although they were numerically superior to the French militia and their Indian allies, Braddock's army was routed and Braddock was killed.<ref name="WDL">{{cite web |url=http://www.wdl.org/en/item/9580/ |title=The Battle of the Monongahela |website=[[World Digital Library]] |date=1755 |accessdate=22 February 2016}}</ref> Later that same year at the Battle of Lake George, the British General William Johnson with a force of 1700 American and Iroquois troops defeated a French force of 2800 French and Canadians and 700 [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native Americans]] led by Baron Dieskau (Military commander of New France).

The fight for control over Ohio Country led to the [[French and Indian War]], which began as the North American phase of the [[Seven Years' War]] (which did not technically begin in Europe until 1756). The war began with the defeat of a Virginia militia contingent led by Colonel [[George Washington]] by the French [[troupes de la marine]] in the [[Ohio Country|Ohio valley]]. As a result of that defeat, the British decided to prepare the conquest of Quebec City, the capital of New France. The British defeated France in Acadia in the [[Battle of Fort Beausejour]] (1755) and then [[Île Royale (New France)|Île Royale]] ([[Cape Breton Island]]) (which also administered Île Saint-Jean ([[Prince Edward Island]]) with the [[Siege of Louisbourg (1758)]].

Throughout the war, the British forcibly removed the Acadians from their lands, which the Mi'kmaq and Acadian militias resisted. The [[Expulsion of the Acadians|Great Upheaval]] continued from 1755 to 1764.

These British military successes were resisted, with successes by the French and Native Americans. In 1756, a large force of French, Canadians, and their Native American allies led by Marquis de Montcalm launched an attack against the key British post at Fort Oswego on Lake Ontario from Fort Frontenac and forced the garrison to surrender. The following year Montcalm with a huge force of 7200 French and Canadians and 2400 Native Americans laid siege to Fort William Henry on the southern shores of Lake George, and after three weeks of fighting the British commander Monroe surrendered. Montcalm gave him honorable terms to return to England and not to fight for 18 months. But many of the Native Americans were hungry for scalps and loot, so when the British force with civilians were three miles from the fort they massacred about 1100 of the 1500 strong force.

The following year the French had one victory and one defeat. The defeat was at the French fortress city of Louisbourg. The victory was at the strip of land between Lake Champlain and Lake George at the French fortress of Fort Carillon. The British force sent to capture Fort Carillon (held by just 3400 French regulars and marines with almost no militia or indigenous support) was the largest ever seen in America at that time: 16,200 British, American, and Iroquois troops under the command of General James Abercrombie. This battle cost the British 2200 troops, several artillery pieces against French losses of around 200 killed or wounded.

While the British [[Siege of Port Royal (1710)|Conquest of Acadia]] happened in 1710, the French continued to remain a significant force in the region with [[Fort Beausejour]] and [[Fortress Louisbourg]]. The dominant population in the region remained Acadian, that is to say, not British. In 1755, the British were successful in the [[Battle of Beausejour]] and immediately after began the [[expulsion of the Acadians]]. The intent of the expulsion, in British military terms, was to neutralize the supposed military threat posed by the Acadian people and stop the vital supply lines they maintained for Louisbourg.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}} <!-- any sources for this military view, plus a source with some text on how the expulsion might be viewed by civilians? Many military actions look vicious to civilians -->

In the meantime the French continued to explore westwards and expand their trade alliances with indigenous peoples. [[Fort de la Corne]] was built in 1753, by [[Louis de la Corne, Chevalier de la Corne]] just east of the [[Saskatchewan River Forks]] in what is today the Canadian province of [[Saskatchewan]]. This was the furthest westward outpost of the French Empire in North America to be established before its fall.

==Treaties of cession==
In 1758, British forces again [[Siege of Louisbourg (1758)|captured Louisbourg]], allowing them to blockade the entrance to the St. Lawrence River. This proved decisive in the war. In 1759, the British besieged Quebec by sea, and an army under General [[James Wolfe]] defeated the French under General [[Louis-Joseph de Montcalm]] at the [[Battle of the Plains of Abraham]] in September. The garrison in Quebec surrendered on 18 September, and by the next year New France had been conquered by the British after the attack on [[Montreal]], which had refused to acknowledge the fall of Canada. The last French governor-general of New France, [[Pierre François de Rigaud, Marquis de Vaudreuil-Cavagnal]], surrendered to British Major General [[Jeffery Amherst, 1st Baron Amherst|Jeffery Amherst]] on 8 September 1760. France formally ceded Canada to the British in the [[Treaty of Paris (1763)|Treaty of Paris]], signed 10 February 1763.<ref>{{cite book |first=Junius P. |last=Rodriguez |title=The Louisiana Purchase: A Historical and Geographical Encyclopedia |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Qs7GAwwdzyQC&pg=PA272 |year=2002 |publisher=ABC-CLIO |page=272 |isbn=978-1-5760-7188-5}}</ref>

The descendants of the [[Acadians]], expelled during the French and Indian War, are dispersed in the Maritime Provinces of Canada, and in Maine and Louisiana in the United States, with small populations in [[Chéticamp, Nova Scotia]] and the [[Magdalen Islands#History|Magdalen Islands]]. Some also went to France.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}} This expulsion has been remembered on [[Royal Proclamation of 2003|July 28]] each year since 2003.

French culture and religion remained dominant in most of the former territory of New France until the arrival of British settlers led to the later creation of [[Upper Canada]] (today [[Ontario]]) and [[New Brunswick]]. The [[Louisiana Territory]], under [[Spain|Spanish]] control since the end of the Seven Years' War, remained off-limits to settlement from the thirteen American colonies.

Twelve years after the British defeated the French, the [[American Revolutionary War]] broke out in Britain's lower [[thirteen colonies]]. Many Québécois would take part in the war, including Major [[Clément Gosselin]] and Admiral [[Louis-Philippe de Vaudreuil]]. After the British surrender at [[Battle of Yorktown (1781)|Yorktown]] in 1781, the [[Treaty of Versailles (1783)|Treaty of Versailles]] gave all former British claims in New France below the [[Great Lakes]] into the possession of the nascent [[United States]]. A Franco-Spanish alliance treaty returned Louisiana to France in 1801, but French leader [[Napoleon Bonaparte]] sold it to the United States in the [[Louisiana Purchase]] in 1803, ending French colonial efforts in North America.

The portions of the former New France that remained under British rule were administered as [[Upper Canada]] and [[Lower Canada]], 1791–1841, and then those regions were merged as the [[Province of Canada]] during 1841–1867, when the passage of the [[Constitution Act, 1867|British North America Act of 1867]] instituted [[home rule]] for most of British North America and established French-speaking Quebec (the former Lower Canada) as one of the original provinces of the [[Confederation of Canada|Dominion of Canada]]. The former French colony of Acadia was first designated the [[Colony of Nova Scotia]] but shortly thereafter the [[Colony of New Brunswick]], which then included Prince Edward Island, was split off from it.

In Canada, [[Bilingualism in Canada|institutional bilingualism]] and [[Canadian identity#French Canadians and Identity in English Canada|strong Francophone identities]] are arguably the most enduring legacy of New France.

The only remnant of the former colonial territory of New France that remains under French control to this day is the French [[overseas collectivity]] of [[Saint Pierre and Miquelon]] (French: Collectivité territoriale de Saint-Pierre-et-Miquelon), consisting of a group of small islands {{convert|25|km|mi nmi}} off the coast of [[Newfoundland and Labrador|Newfoundland]], Canada.

==Political divisions of New France==
[[File:Constitution-of-new-france-1759.png|thumb|A chart showing the political organization of New France, c. 1759]]
The territory of New France was divided into five colonies, each with its own administration: [[Canada (New France)|Canada]], Hudson's Bay, [[Acadia]], [[Newfoundland (island)|Newfoundland]] [[Placentia, Newfoundland and Labrador|(Plaisance)]], and [[Louisiana (New France)|Louisiana]].<ref name=Francis2009 /><ref name=Territoire /><ref>{{cite web |url=https://slmc.uottawa.ca/?q=canada_new_france |title=Canada at the Time of New France  |date=2004  |author=University of Ottawa |accessdate= March 24, 2017}}</ref> The Treaty of Utrecht resulted in the relinquishing of French claims to mainland Acadia, the Hudson Bay and Newfoundland, and the establishment of the colony of [[Cape Breton Island|Île Royale]], now called Cape Breton Island, where the French built the [[Fortress of Louisbourg]].<ref name=Johnston2001 /><ref name=Louisbourg /> Acadia had a difficult history, with the [[Expulsion of the Acadians|Great Upheaval]], remembered on [[Royal Proclamation of 2003|July 28]] each year since 2003. The [[Acadians|descendants]] are dispersed in the Maritime Provinces of Canada, in Maine and Louisiana in the United States, with small populations in [[Chéticamp, Nova Scotia]] and the [[Magdalen Islands#History|Magdalen Islands]].

In terms of 21st century political divisions and nations, New France included Acadia (eastern Quebec, the coastal territories, and claims to New England as far as Philadelphia, Canada (modern eastern Canada and the Canadian plains in central Canada to the edge of modern-day Alberta), and Louisiana (a vast territory stretching across much of the east half of modern Midwestern United States).

==Historiography==
The Conquest (the overall fall of New France, particularly centered on the 1759 surrender of Quebec after British victory over French forces) has always been a central and contested theme of Canadian memory—as exemplified by an episode in 2009, when re-enactors were prevented from restaging the decisive 1759 battles in Quebec. Cornelius Jaenen argues that "The Conquest has remained a difficult subject for French-Canadian historians" who were divided in viewing it. One group sees it as a highly negative economic, political and ideological disaster that threatened a way of life with materialism and Protestantism. At the other pole are those historians who see the positive benefit of enabling the preservation of language, and religion and traditional customs under British rule.<ref name=Jaenen>{{cite book |last=Jaenen |first=Cornelius J. |title=Canada during the French regime |editor-last=Muise |editor-first=D.A. |work=A Reader's Guide to Canadian History: Volume 1: Beginnings to Confederation |year=1982 |page=40 |isbn=978-0-8020-6442-4}}</ref> French Canadian debates have escalated since the 1960s, as the conquest is seen as a pivotal moment in the history of Québec's nationalism. Francophone historian Jocelyn Létourneau suggested in 2009, that today, "1759 does not belong primarily to a past that we might wish to study and understand, but, rather, to a present and a future that we might wish to shape and control."<ref>{{cite book |first=Jocelyn |last=Létourneau |title=What is to be done with 1759? |editor-first1=Phillip |editor-last1=Buckner |editor-last2=Reid |editor-first2=John G. |work=Remembering 1759: The Conquest of Canada in Historical Memory |publisher=University of Toronto Press |year=2012 |page=279 |isbn=978-1-4426-9924-3 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yiOOuORbGpAC&pg=PA279}}</ref>

Some Anglophone historians, on the other hand, portray the Conquest as a victory for British military, political and economic superiority that was a permanent benefit to the French.<ref name=Jaenen/>
