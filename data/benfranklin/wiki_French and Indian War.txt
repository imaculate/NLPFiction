The '''French and Indian War''' (1754–1763) pitted the colonies of [[British America]] against those of [[New France]], each side supported by military units from the parent country and by American Indian allies. At the start of the war, the French colonies had a population of roughly 60,000 settlers, compared with 2 million in the British colonies.<ref>Gary Walton; History of the American Economy; page 27</ref> The outnumbered French particularly depended on the Indians.

The European nations declared a wider war upon one another overseas in 1756, two years into the French and Indian war, and some view the French and Indian War as being merely the American theater of the worldwide [[Seven Years' War]] of 1756–63; however, the French and Indian War is viewed in America as a singular conflict which was not associated with any European war. The name ''French and Indian War'' is used mainly in the United States, referring to the two enemies of the British colonists, while European historians use the term ''Seven Years' War'', as do English-speaking Canadians.<ref>M. Brook Taylor, ''Canadian History: a Reader's Guide: Volume 1: Beginnings to Confederation'' (1994) pp 39–48, 72–74</ref> French Canadians call it '''Guerre de la Conquête''' (the War of the Conquest)<ref>[http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.com/index.cfm?PgNm=TCE&Params=a1ARTA0007300 ''The Canadian Encyclopedia''] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110806000000/http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.com/index.cfm?PgNm=TCE&Params=a1ARTA0007300 |date=August 6, 2011 }}</ref><ref>[http://bataille.ccbn-nbc.gc.ca/en/guerre-de-sept-ans/contexte.php "The Siege of Quebec: An episode of the Seven Years' War"], Canadian National Battlefields Commission, Plains of Abraham website</ref> or (rarely) the '''Fourth Intercolonial War'''.

The British colonists were supported at various times by the [[Iroquois Confederacy|Iroquois]], [[Catawba (tribe)|Catawba]], and  [[Cherokee]] tribes, and the French colonists were supported by [[Wabanaki Confederacy]] member tribes [[Abenaki people|Abenaki]] and [[Mi'kmaq militia|Mi'kmaq]], and the [[Algonquin people|Algonquin]], [[Lenape]], [[Ojibwa]], [[Ottawa (tribe)|Ottawa]], [[Shawnee]], and [[Wyandot people|Wyandot]] tribes. Fighting took place primarily along the frontiers between New France and the British colonies, from the [[Province of Virginia]] in the south to [[Newfoundland]] in the north. It began with a dispute over control of the confluence of the [[Allegheny River]] and [[Monongahela River]] called the [[Forks of the Ohio]], and the site of the French [[Fort Duquesne]] in [[Pittsburgh]], Pennsylvania.  The dispute erupted into violence in the [[Battle of Jumonville Glen]] in May 1754, during which Virginia militiamen under the command of 22 year-old [[George Washington]] ambushed a French patrol.

In 1755, six colonial governors met with General [[Edward Braddock]], the newly arrived British Army commander, and planned a four-way attack on the French.  None succeeded, and [[Braddock Expedition|the main effort]] by Braddock proved a disaster; he lost the [[Battle of the Monongahela]] on July 9, 1755 and died a few days later. British operations failed in the frontier areas of the [[Province of Pennsylvania]] and the [[Province of New York]] during 1755–57 due to a combination of poor management, internal divisions, effective Canadian scouts, French regular forces, and Indian warrior allies. In 1755, the British captured [[Battle of Fort Beauséjour|Fort Beauséjour]] on the border separating [[Nova Scotia]] from [[Acadia]], and they ordered the [[expulsion of the Acadians]] (1755–64) soon afterwards. Orders for the deportation were given by Commander-in-Chief [[William Shirley]] without direction from Great Britain. The Acadians were expelled, both those captured in arms and those who had sworn the loyalty oath to the King. Indians likewise were driven off the land to make way for settlers from New England.<ref>Eccles, ''France in America'', p. 185</ref>

The British colonial government fell in the region of Nova Scotia after several disastrous campaigns in 1757, including a failed [[Louisbourg Expedition (1757)|expedition against Louisbourg]] and the [[Siege of Fort William Henry]]; this last was followed by Indians torturing and massacring their colonial victims. [[William Pitt, 1st Earl of Chatham|William Pitt]] came to power and significantly increased British military resources in the colonies at a time when France was unwilling to risk large convoys to aid the limited forces that they had in New France, preferring to concentrate their forces against [[Prussia]] and its allies who were now engaged in the Seven Years' War in Europe. Between 1758 and 1760, the British military launched a campaign to capture the [[Canada (New France)|Colony of Canada]] (part of New France). They succeeded in capturing territory in surrounding colonies and ultimately [[Battle of the Plains of Abraham|the city of Quebec]] (1759). The British later lost the [[Battle of Sainte-Foy]] west of Quebec (1760), but the French ceded Canada in accordance with the [[Treaty of Paris (1763)]].

France ceded its territory east of the Mississippi to Great Britain. It ceded [[Louisiana (New France)|French Louisiana]] west of the [[Mississippi River]] (including New Orleans) to its ally Spain in compensation for Spain's loss to Britain of [[Spanish Florida]]. (Spain had ceded Florida to Britain in exchange for the return of [[Havana]], Cuba.) France's colonial presence north of the Caribbean was reduced to the islands of [[Saint Pierre and Miquelon]], confirming Great Britain's position as the dominant colonial power in America.

==Nomenclature==
In British America, wars were often named after the sitting British monarch, such as [[King William's War]] or [[Queen Anne's War]]. There had already been a [[King George's War]] in the 1740s during the reign of [[George II of Great Britain|King George II]], so British colonists named this conflict after their opponents, and it became known as the ''French and Indian War''.<ref name="anderson crucible of war 747"/> This continues as the standard name for the war in the United States, although Indians fought on both sides of the conflict. It also led into the Seven Years' War overseas, a much larger conflict between France and Great Britain that did not involve the American colonies; some historians make a connection between the French and Indian War and the Seven Years' War overseas, but most residents of the United States consider them as two separate conflicts—only one of which involved the American colonies,<ref>Jennings, p. xv.</ref> and American historians generally use the traditional name. Less frequently used names for the war include the ''Fourth Intercolonial War'' and the ''Great War for the Empire''.<ref name="anderson crucible of war 747">Anderson (2000), p. 747.</ref>
[[File:SevenYearsWar.png|thumb|left|275px|Belligerents during the [[Seven Years' War]]. Canadians and Europeans view the French and Indian War as a theatre of the Seven Years' War, while Americans view it a separate conflict.]]
In Europe, the French and Indian War is conflated into the Seven Years' War and not given a separate name. "Seven Years" refers to events in Europe, from the official declaration of war in 1756—two years after the French and Indian War had started—to the signing of the peace treaty in 1763. The French and Indian War in America, by contrast, was largely concluded in six years from the [[Battle of Jumonville Glen]] in 1754 to the capture of Montreal in 1760.<ref name="anderson crucible of war 747"/>

Canadians conflate both the European and American conflicts into the Seven Years' War (''Guerre de Sept Ans'').<ref>[http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.com/index.cfm?PgNm=TCE&Params=A1ARTA0007300 The Canadian Encyclopedia: Seven Years' War] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110806000000/http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.com/index.cfm?PgNm=TCE&Params=A1ARTA0007300 |date=August 6, 2011 }}.</ref><ref>{{fr icon}} [http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.com/index.cfm?PgNm=TCE&Params=F1ARTF0007300 L'Encyclopédie canadienne: Guerre de Sept Ans].</ref> French Canadians also use the term "War of Conquest" (''Guerre de la Conquête''), since it is the war in which Canada was conquered by the British and became part of the British Empire. In Quebec, this term was promoted by popular historians [[Jacques Lacoursière]] and [[Denis Vaugeois]], who borrowed from the ideas of [[Maurice Séguin]] in considering this war as a dramatic tipping point of French Canadian identity and nationhood.<ref name="BucknerReid2012">{{cite book|author1=Brian Young|editor1=John G.

==Background==
[[File:François Mercier, voyageur canadien.jpg|thumb|upright|The [[coureur des bois]] were French Canadian [[North American fur trade|fur traders]], who did business with natives throughout the [[Mississippi River|Mississippi]] and [[St. Lawrence River|St. Lawrence watershed]].]]
At this time, America east of the Mississippi River was largely claimed by either Great Britain or France. Large areas had no colonial settlements. The French population numbered about 75,000 and was heavily concentrated along the [[St. Lawrence River]] valley, with some also in Acadia (present-day [[New Brunswick]] and parts of [[Nova Scotia]]), including Île Royale ([[Cape Breton Island]]). Fewer lived in [[New Orleans]], [[Biloxi, Mississippi]], [[Mobile, Alabama]], and small settlements in the [[Illinois Country]], hugging the east side of the Mississippi River and its tributaries. French fur traders and trappers traveled throughout the St. Lawrence and Mississippi watersheds, did business with local Indian tribes, and often married Indian women.<ref>{{cite book |first=John |last=Powell |title=Encyclopedia of North American immigration |year=2005 |location=New York |publisher=Facts on File |page=204 |isbn=0816046581 }}</ref> Traders married daughters of chiefs, creating high-ranking unions.

British settlers outnumbered the French 20 to 1<ref>John Wade, "British History Chronologically Arranged, 2: Comprehending a Chamfied Analysis of Events and Occurencis in Church and State ... from the First Invasions by the Romans to A.d. 1847", p.46 [https://books.google.com/books?id=CA5oV-kN6NMC&pg=PA446]</ref> with a population of about 1.5 million ranged along the eastern coast of the continent from Nova Scotia and the [[Colony of Newfoundland]] in the north to the [[Province of Georgia]] in the south.<ref>{{cite book |first=Francis D. |last=Cogliano |title=Revolutionary America, 1763–1815: A Political History |year=2008 |location=London |publisher=Routledge |page=32 |isbn=9780415964869 }}</ref> Many of the older colonies had land claims that extended arbitrarily far to the west, as the extent of the continent was unknown at the time when their provincial charters were granted. Their population centers were along the coast, yet the settlements were growing into the interior. Nova Scotia had been captured from France in 1713, and it still had a significant French-speaking population. Britain also claimed [[Rupert's Land]] where the [[Hudson's Bay Company]] traded for furs with local Indian tribes.
[[File:5NationsExpansion.jpg|left|thumb|Map of Iroquois expansion, 1711. By the mid-18th century, the [[Iroquois Confederacy]] had expanded from Upstate New York to the [[Ohio Country]].]]
In between the French and British colonists, large areas were dominated by Indian tribes. To the north, the [[Mi'kmaq people|Mi'kmaqs]] and the [[Abenaki people|Abenakis]] were engaged in [[Father Le Loutre's War]] and still held sway in parts of Nova Scotia, Acadia, and the eastern portions of the [[Canada, New France|province of Canada]], as well as much of Maine.<ref>Jennings, pp. 9, 176</ref> The [[Iroquois Confederation]] dominated much of upstate New York and the [[Ohio Country]], although Ohio also included [[Algonquian languages|Algonquian]]-speaking populations of [[Lenape|Delaware]] and [[Shawnee]], as well as [[Iroquoian languages|Iroquoian]]-speaking [[Mingos]]. These tribes were formally under Iroquois rule and were limited by them in their authority to make agreements.<ref name=A2K_23>Anderson (2000), p. 23</ref>

The Southeast interior was dominated by Siouan-speaking [[Catawba (tribe)|Catawbas]], [[Muskogean languages|Muskogee]]-speaking [[Creek (tribe)|Creeks]] and [[Choctaw]], and the Iroquoian-speaking [[Cherokee]] tribes.<ref>Jennings, p. 8</ref> When war broke out, the French colonists used their trading connections to recruit fighters from tribes in western portions of the [[Great Lakes region (North America)|Great Lakes region]], which was not directly subject to the conflict between the French and British; these included the [[Huron (tribe)|Hurons]], [[Mississaugas|Mississaugs]], [[Ojibwas]], [[Winnebago (tribe)|Winnebagos]], and [[Potawatomi]]. The British colonists were supported in the war by the Iroquois [[Iroquois Confederacy|Six Nations]] and also by the Cherokees, until differences sparked the [[Anglo-Cherokee War]] in 1758. In 1758, the [[Province of Pennsylvania]] successfully negotiated the [[Treaty of Easton]] in which a number of tribes in the Ohio Country promised neutrality in exchange for land concessions and other considerations. Most of the other northern tribes sided with the French, their primary trading partner and supplier of arms. The Creeks and Cherokees were subject to diplomatic efforts by both the French and British to gain either their support or neutrality in the conflict.
[[File:Three Cherokee.jpg|thumb|The [[Cherokee]], c. 1762. The Cherokee were subject to diplomatic efforts from the British and French in order to gain their support or neutrality in the event of a conflict.]]
By this time, Spain claimed only the province of Florida in eastern America; it controlled Cuba and other territories in the [[West Indies]] that became military objectives in the Seven Years' War. Florida's European population was a few hundred, concentrated in [[St. Augustine, Florida|St. Augustine]] and [[Pensacola, Florida|Pensacola]].

At the start of the war, no French regular army troops were stationed in America, and few British troops. New France was defended by about 3,000 [[troupes de la marine]], companies of colonial regulars (some of whom had significant woodland combat experience). The colonial government recruited militia support when needed. Most of the British colonies mustered local militia companies to deal with Indian threats, generally ill trained and available only for short periods, but they did not have any standing forces. Virginia, by contrast, had a large frontier with several companies of British regulars.

The colonial governments were used to operating independently of one another and of the government in London, a situation that complicated negotiations with Indian tribes, whose territories often encompassed land claimed by multiple colonies. After the war began, the leaders of the British Army establishment tried to impose constraints and demands on the colonial administrations.

===Céloron's expedition===
New France's Governor-General [[Roland-Michel Barrin de La Galissonière]] was concerned about the incursion and expanding influence in the Ohio Country of British colonial traders such as [[George Croghan]].  In June 1747, he ordered [[Pierre Joseph Céloron de Blainville|Pierre-Joseph Céloron]] to lead a military expedition through the area. Its objectives were:
[[File:La Galissonière-French school 18th century img 3172.jpg|upright|left|thumb|[[Roland-Michel Barrin de La Galissonière]], the [[Governor of New France]] sent an expedition in 1749 into the Ohio Country in an attempt to assert French sovereignty.]]
* to reaffirm to New France's Indian allies that their trading arrangements with colonists were exclusive to those authorized by New France
* to confirm Indian assistance in asserting and maintaining the French claim to the territories which French explorers had claimed
* to discourage any alliances between Britain and local Indian tribes
* to impress the Indians with a French show of force against British colonial settler incursion, unauthorized trading expeditions, and general trespass against French claims<ref name=A2K_26>Anderson (2000), p. 26.</ref>

Céloron's expedition force consisted of about 200 [[Troupes de la marine]] and 30 Indians, and they covered about {{convert|3000|mi|km}} between June and November 1749. They went up the St. Lawrence, continued along the northern shore of [[Lake Ontario]], crossed the portage at Niagara, and followed the southern shore of [[Lake Erie]]. At the [[French Portage Road|Chautauqua Portage]] near [[Barcelona, New York]], the expedition moved inland to the [[Allegheny River]], which it followed to the site of [[Pittsburgh]]. There Céloron buried lead plates engraved with the French claim to the Ohio Country.<ref name=A2K_26/> Whenever he encountered British colonial merchants or fur-traders, he informed them of the French claims on the territory and told them to leave.<ref name=A2K_26/>

Céloron's expedition arrived at [[Logstown]] where the Indians in the area informed him that they owned the Ohio Country and that they would trade with the British colonists regardless of the French.<ref name="fowler 14">Fowler, p. 14.</ref> He continued south until his expedition reached the confluence of the Ohio and the [[Great Miami River|Miami]] rivers, which lay just south of the village of [[Pickawillany]], the home of the [[Miami tribe|Miami]] chief known as "[[Old Briton]]". Céloron threatened Old Briton with severe consequences if he continued to trade with British colonists, but Old Briton ignored the warning. Céloron returned disappointedly to Montreal in November 1749.<ref name="ParkLoram">[http://www.dnr.state.oh.us/parks/magazinehome/magazine/sprsum2006/parkspotlight/tabid/310/Default.aspx "Park Spotlight: Lake Loramie"], ''Ohio State Parks Magazine'', Spring 2006</ref>

Céloron wrote an extensively detailed report. "All I can say is that the Natives of these localities are very badly disposed towards the French," he wrote, "and are entirely devoted to the English. I don't know in what way they could be brought back."<ref name="fowler 14"/> Even before his return to Montreal, reports on the situation in the Ohio Country were making their way to London and Paris, each side proposing that action be taken. [[Province of Massachusetts Bay|Massachusetts]] governor [[William Shirley]] was particularly forceful, stating that British colonists would not be safe as long as the French were present.<ref name="fowler 15">Fowler, p. 15.</ref>

===Negotiations===
[[File:Nouvelle-France map-en.svg|thumb|upright=1.5|Map of European colonies in North America, c. 1750. Disputes over territorial claims persisted after the end of [[King George's War]] in 1748.]]
The [[War of the Austrian Succession]] (better known as King George's War) formally ended in 1748 with the signing of the [[Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle (1748)|Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle]], which was primarily focused on resolving issues in Europe. The issues of conflicting territorial claims between British and French colonies were turned over to a commission, but it reached no decision. Frontier areas were claimed by both sides, from Nova Scotia and Acadia in the north to the Ohio Country in the south. The disputes also extended into the [[Atlantic Ocean]], where both powers wanted access to the rich fisheries of the [[Grand Banks of Newfoundland|Grand Banks]] off [[Newfoundland (island)|Newfoundland]].

In 1749, the British government gave land to the [[Ohio Company of Virginia]] for the purpose of developing trade and settlements in the Ohio Country.<ref>Alfred P. James, ''[[The Ohio Company: Its Inner History]]'' (1959) pp. 26–40</ref> The grant required that it settle 100 families in the territory and construct a fort for their protection. But the territory was also claimed by Pennsylvania, and both colonies began pushing for action to improve their respective claims.<ref>Jennings, p. 15</ref> In 1750, [[Christopher Gist]] explored the Ohio territory, acting on behalf of both Virginia and the company, and he opened negotiations with the Indian tribes at Logstown.<ref>Jennings, p. 18</ref> He completed the 1752 Treaty of Logstown in which the local Indians agreed to terms through their "Half-King" [[Tanacharison]] and an Iroquois representative. These terms included permission to build a strong house at the mouth of the [[Monongahela River]] on the modern site of [[Pittsburgh]], Pennsylvania.<ref>Anderson (2000), p. 28</ref> By the late 17th century, the Iroquois had pushed many tribes out of the Ohio Valley, and they laid claim to it as their hunting ground by right of conquest.

===Escalation in Ohio Country===
Governor-General of New France [[Jacques-Pierre de Taffanel de la Jonquière, Marquis de la Jonquière|Marquis de la Jonquière]] died on March 17, 1752, and he was temporarily replaced by Charles le Moyne de Longueuil. His permanent replacement was to be [[Michel-Ange Duquesne de Menneville|the Marquis Duquesne]], but he did not arrive in New France until 1752 to take over the post.<ref>Anderson (2000), p. 27</ref> The continuing British activity in the Ohio territories prompted Longueuil to dispatch another expedition to the area under the command of [[Charles Michel de Langlade]], an officer in the Troupes de la Marine. Langlade was given 300 men, including [[French-Canadians]] and warriors of the [[Ottawa (tribe)|Ottawa tribe]]. His objective was to punish the Miami people of Pickawillany for not following Céloron's orders to cease trading with the British. On June 21, the French war party [[Raid on Pickawillany|attacked the trading centre]] at Pickawillany, capturing three traders<ref name="ParkLoram"/> and killing 14 Miami Indians, including Old Briton. He was reportedly ritually cannibalized by some Indians in the expedition party.

====Construction of French fortifications====
{{refimprove section|date=April 2017}}
[[File:Fort Le Boeuf.jpg|thumb|[[Fort Le Boeuf]] in 1754. In the spring of 1753, the French began to build a series of forts in the Ohio Country.]]
In the spring of 1753, [[Paul Marin de la Malgue]] was given command of a 2,000-man force of Troupes de la Marine and Indians. His orders were to protect the King's land in the Ohio Valley from the British. Marin followed the route that Céloron had mapped out four years earlier. Céloron, however, had limited the record of French claims to the burial of lead plates, whereas Marin constructed and garrisoned forts. He first constructed [[Fort Presque Isle]] on Lake Erie's south shore near [[Erie, Pennsylvania]], and he had a road built to the headwaters of [[LeBoeuf Creek (Pennsylvania)|LeBoeuf Creek]]. He then constructed a second fort at [[Fort Le Boeuf]] in [[Waterford, Pennsylvania]], designed to guard the headwaters of LeBoeuf Creek. As he moved south, he drove off or captured British traders, alarming both the British and the Iroquois. [[Tanaghrisson]] was a chief of the [[Mingo]] Indians, who were remnants of Iroquois and other tribes who had been driven west by colonial expansion. He intensely disliked the French whom he accused of killing and eating his father. He traveled to Fort Le Boeuf and threatened the French with military action, which Marin contemptuously dismissed.<ref name="fowler 31">Fowler, p. 31.</ref>

The Iroquois sent runners to the manor of [[Sir William Johnson, 1st Baronet|William Johnson]] in upstate New York, who was the British Superintendent for Indian Affairs in the New York region and beyond. Johnson was known to the Iroquois as ''Warraghiggey'', meaning "he who does great things." He spoke their languages and had become a respected honorary member of the [[Iroquois|Iroquois Confederacy]] in the area, and he was made a colonel of the Iroquois in 1746; he was later commissioned as a colonel of the Western New York Militia.

The Indian representatives and Johnson met with Governor [[George Clinton (Royal Navy officer)|George Clinton]] and officials from some of the other American colonies at [[Albany, New York]]. [[Mohawk people|Mohawk]] [[Chief Hendrick]] was the speaker of their tribal council, and he insisted that the British abide by their obligations{{which|date=April 2017}} and block French expansion. Clinton did not respond to his satisfaction, and Hendrick said that the "[[Covenant Chain]]" was broken, a long-standing friendly relationship between the Iroquois Confederacy and the British Crown.

====Virginia's response====
[[File:Washington 1772.jpg|thumb|upright|In 1754, [[George Washington]], of the [[Virginia Regiment]], was dispatched to warn the French to leave Virginian territory.]]
Governor [[Robert Dinwiddie]] of Virginia was an investor in the Ohio Company, which stood to lose money if the French held their claim.<ref>O'Meara, p. 48</ref> He ordered 21 year-old Major [[George Washington]] (whose brother was another Ohio Company investor) of the [[Virginia Regiment]] to [[George Washington in the French and Indian War|warn the French to leave Virginia territory]] in October 1753.<ref name=A2K_42_3>Anderson (2000), pp. 42–43</ref> Washington left with a small party, picking up [[Jacob Van Braam]] as an interpreter, [[Christopher Gist]] (a company surveyor working in the area), and a few Mingos led by Tanaghrisson. On December 12, Washington and his men reached Fort Le Boeuf.<ref>Anderson (2000), p. 43</ref><ref>Jennings, p. 63</ref>

[[Jacques Legardeur de Saint-Pierre]] succeeded Marin as commander of the French forces after Marin died on October 29, and he invited Washington to dine with him. Over dinner, Washington presented Saint-Pierre with the letter from Dinwiddie demanding an immediate French withdrawal from the Ohio Country. Saint-Pierre said, "As to the Summons you send me to retire, I do not think myself obliged to obey it."<ref name="fowler 35">Fowler, p. 35.</ref> He told Washington that France's claim to the region was superior to that of the British, since [[René-Robert Cavelier, Sieur de La Salle]] had explored the Ohio Country nearly a century earlier.<ref name="ellis 5">Ellis, ''His Excellency George Washington'', p. 5.</ref>

Washington's party left Fort Le Boeuf early on December 16 and arrived in [[Williamsburg, Virginia|Williamsburg]] on January 16, 1754. He stated in his report, "The French had swept south",<ref name="fowler 36">Fowler, p. 36.</ref> detailing the steps which they had taken to fortify the area, and their intention to fortify the confluence of the Allegheny and Monongahela rivers.<ref>O'Meara, pp. 37–38.</ref>

==Course of war==
Even before Washington returned, Dinwiddie had sent a company of 40 men under [[William Trent]] to that point where they began construction of a small [[stockade]]d fort in the early months of 1754.<ref>O'Meara, p. 41</ref> Governor Duquesne sent additional French forces under [[Claude-Pierre Pécaudy de Contrecœur]] to relieve Saint-Pierre during the same period, and Contrecœur led 500 men south from Fort Venango on April 5, 1754.<ref>O'Meara, pp. 43–45</ref> These forces arrived at the fort on April 16, but Contrecœur generously allowed Trent's small company to withdraw.

===Early engagements===
Dinwiddie had ordered Washington to lead a larger force to assist Trent in his work, and Washington learned of Trent's retreat while he was en route.<ref>Anderson (2000), p. 50</ref> Mingo sachem Tanaghrisson had promised support to the British, so Washington continued toward Fort Duquesne and met with him. He then learned of a French scouting party in the area, so he combined Tanaghrisson's force with his own and surprised the [[Canadiens|Canadians]] on May 28 in what became known as the [[Battle of Jumonville Glen]]. They killed many of the Canadians, including their commanding officer [[Joseph Coulon de Jumonville]], whose head was reportedly split open by Tanaghrisson with a tomahawk. Historian [[Fred Anderson (historian)|Fred Anderson]] suggests that Tanaghrisson was acting to gain the support of the British and to regain authority over his own people. They had been inclined to support the French, with whom they had long trading relationships. One of Tanaghrisson's men told Contrecoeur that Jumonville had been killed by British musket fire.<ref name="AndersonCrucible51_9">Anderson (2000), pp. 51–59.</ref> Historians generally consider the Battle of Jumonville Glen as the opening battle of the French and Indian War in North America, and the start of hostilities in the Ohio valley.

Following the battle, Washington pulled back several miles and established [[Fort Necessity National Battlefield|Fort Necessity]], which the Canadians attacked under the command of Jumonville's brother at the [[Battle of Fort Necessity]] on July 3. Washington surrendered and negotiated a withdrawal under arms. One of his men reported that the Canadian force was accompanied by [[Shawnee]], [[Delaware]], and Mingo warriors—just those whom Tanaghrisson was seeking to influence.<ref name="AndersonCrucible59_65">Anderson (2000), pp. 59–65.</ref>

News of the two battles reached England in August. After several months of negotiations, the government of [[Thomas Pelham-Holles, 1st Duke of Newcastle-upon-Tyne|the Duke of Newcastle]] decided to send an army expedition the following year to dislodge the French.<ref name="Fowler52">Fowler, p. 52.</ref> They chose Major General [[Edward Braddock]] to lead the expedition.<ref>Lengel p. 52.</ref> Word of the British military plans leaked to France well before Braddock's departure for North America.

An early important political response to the opening of hostilities was the convening of the [[Albany Congress]] in June and July, 1754.  The goal of the congress was to formalize a unified front in trade and negotiations with various Indians, since allegiance of the various tribes and nations was seen to be pivotal in the war that was unfolding.  The plan that the delegates agreed to was neither ratified by the colonial legislatures nor approved of by the Crown.  Nevertheless, the format of the congress and many specifics of the plan became the prototype for confederation during the [[American Revolutionary War|War of Independence]].

===British campaigns, 1755===
The British formed an aggressive plan of operations for 1755. General Braddock was to lead the expedition to Fort Duquesne,<ref name="WDL">{{cite web |url=http://www.wdl.org/en/item/9580/ |title = The Battle of the Monongahela |website = [[World Digital Library]] |year = 1755 |accessdate = 2013-08-03 }}</ref> while Massachusetts governor [[William Shirley]] was given the task of fortifying [[Fort Oswego]] and attacking [[Fort Niagara]].

The battle saw the [[Braddock expedition|British attempt]] to take the [[Fort Duquesne]] repulsed.]]
Braddock led about 1,500 army troops and provincial militia on the [[Braddock expedition]] in June 1755 to take Fort Duquesne, with George Washington as one of his aides. The expedition was a disaster. It was [[Battle of the Monongahela|attacked]] by French regulars, [[Canadian Militia|Canadian militiamen]], and Indian warriors ambushing them from hiding places up in trees and behind logs, and Braddock called for a retreat. He was killed and approximately 1,000 British soldiers were killed or injured.<ref name="WDL"/> The remaining 500 British troops retreated to Virginia, led by Washington. Washington and [[Thomas Gage]] played key roles in organizing the retreat—two future opponents in the [[American Revolutionary War]].

The government initiated a plan to increase their military capability in preparation for war following news of Braddock's defeat and the start of parliament's session in November 1755. Among the early legislative measures were the Recruiting Act 1756,<ref>[https://archive.org/stream/statutesatlarge57britgoog#page/n364 ''An act for the speedy and effectual recruiting of his Majesty's land forces and marines.''], p.318</ref> the Commissions to Foreign Protestants Act 1756<ref>[https://archive.org/stream/statutesatlarge57britgoog#page/n376 ''An act to enable his Majesty to grant commissions to a certain number of foreign Protestants who have served abroad as officers, or engineers, to act and rank as officers, or engineers, in America only, under certain restrictions and qualifications."], p.331</ref> for the [[King's Royal Rifle Corps|Royal American Regiment]], the Navigation Act 1756,<ref>[https://archive.org/stream/statutesatlarge57britgoog#page/n416/search/America ''An act for the better supply of mariners and seamen to serve in his Majesty's ships of war, and on board merchant ships, and other trading ships and vessels.''], p.370</ref> and the Continuance of Acts 1756.<ref>[https://archive.org/stream/statutesatlarge57britgoog#page/n500 ''An act for extending (the Navy Act 1748, 22 Geo. 2 c. 33) (for amending, explaining, and reducing into one act of parliament the laws relating to the government of his Majesty's ships, vessels and forces by sea) to such officers,  seamen, and others, as shall serve on board his Majesty's ships or vessels employed upon the lakes, great waters, or rivers, in North America.''], p.457</ref> England passed the Naval Prize Act 1756 following the proclamation of war on May 17 to allow the capture of ships and establish privateering.<ref>[https://archive.org/stream/statutesatlarge57britgoog#page/n524/search/America ''An act for the encouragement of seamen, and the more effectual manning of his Majesty's navy.''] p.481</ref>

The French acquired a copy of the British war plans, including the activities of Shirley and Johnson. Shirley's efforts to fortify Oswego were bogged down in logistical difficulties, exacerbated by his inexperience in managing large expeditions. In conjunction, he was made aware that the French were massing for an attack on Fort Oswego in his absence when he planned to attack Fort Niagara. As a response, he left garrisons at Oswego, [[Fort Bull]], and Fort Williams, the last two located on the [[Oneida Carry]] between the [[Mohawk River]] and [[Wood Creek]] at [[Rome, New York]]. Supplies were cached at Fort Bull for use in the projected attack on Niagara.

Johnson's expedition was better organized than Shirley's, which was noticed by New France's governor the [[Pierre François de Rigaud, Marquis de Vaudreuil-Cavagnal|Marquis de Vaudreuil]]. He had been concerned about the extended supply line to the forts on the Ohio, and he had sent Baron Dieskau to lead the defenses at Frontenac against Shirley's expected attack. Vaudreuil saw Johnson as the larger threat and sent Dieskau to Fort St. Frédéric to meet that threat. Dieskau planned to attack the British encampment at [[Fort Edward (village), New York|Fort Edward]] at the upper end of navigation on the [[Hudson River]], but Johnson had strongly fortified it, and Dieskau's Indian support was reluctant to attack. The two forces finally met in the bloody [[Battle of Lake George]] between Fort Edward and [[Fort William Henry]]. The battle ended inconclusively, with both sides withdrawing from the field. Johnson's advance stopped at Fort William Henry, and the French withdrew to Ticonderoga Point, where they began the construction of [[Fort Carillon]] (later renamed [[Fort Ticonderoga]] after the British captured it in 1759).

Colonel Monckton [[Battle of Fort Beausejour|captured Fort Beauséjour]] in June 1755 in the sole British success that year, cutting off the French [[Fortress Louisbourg]] from land-based reinforcements. To cut vital supplies to Louisbourg, Nova Scotia's Governor [[Charles Lawrence (British Army officer)|Charles Lawrence]] ordered the deportation of the French-speaking [[Acadian]] population from the area. Monckton's forces, including companies of [[Rogers' Rangers]], [[Great Upheaval|forcibly removed]] thousands of Acadians, chasing down many who resisted and sometimes committing atrocities. Cutting off supplies to Louisbourg led to its demise.<ref>{{cite book |last=Patterson |first=Stephen E. |chapter=1744–1763: Colonial Wars and Aboriginal Peoples |editor1-first=Phillip |editor1-last=Buckner |editor2-first=John |editor2-last=Reid |title=The Atlantic Region to Confederation: A History |location=Toronto |publisher=University of Toronto Press |year=1994 |page=152 |isbn=0802005535 }}</ref> The Acadian resistance was sometimes quite stiff, in concert with Indian allies including the Mi'kmaq, with ongoing frontier raids against [[Raid on Dartmouth (1751)|Dartmouth]] and [[Raid on Lunenburg (1756)|Lunenburg]], among others.

===French victories, 1756–1757===
{{See also|Franco-Indian alliance}}
Following the death of Braddock, William Shirley assumed command of British forces in North America, and he laid out his plans for 1756 at a meeting in Albany in December 1755. He proposed renewing the efforts to capture Niagara, Crown Point, and Duquesne, with attacks on [[Fort Frontenac]] on the north shore of Lake Ontario and an expedition through the wilderness of the [[District of Maine|Maine district]] and down the [[Chaudière River]] to attack the [[Quebec City|city of Quebec]]. His plan, however, got bogged down by disagreements and disputes with others, including William Johnson and New York's Governor [[Charles Hardy|Sir Charles Hardy]], and consequently gained little support.
[[File:4thEarlOfLoudoun.jpg|thumb|upright|left|In January 1756, [[John Campbell, 4th Earl of Loudoun|John Campbell]] was named as the new British [[Commander-in-Chief, North America]].]]
Newcastle replaced him in January 1756 with [[John Campbell, 4th Earl of Loudoun|Lord Loudoun]], with Major General [[James Abercrombie (general)|James Abercrombie]] as his second in command. Neither of these men had as much campaign experience as the trio of officers whom France sent to North America.<ref name="Fowler98" /> French regular army reinforcements arrived in New France in May 1756, led by Major General [[Louis-Joseph de Montcalm]] and seconded by the [[Chevalier de Lévis]] and Colonel François-Charles de Bourlamaque, all experienced veterans from the [[War of the Austrian Succession]]. On May 18, 1756, Britain formally declared war on France, which expanded the war into Europe and came to be known as the [[Seven Years' War]].

Governor Vaudreuil had ambitions to become the French commander in chief, in addition to his role as governor, and he acted during the winter of 1756 before those reinforcements arrived. Scouts had reported the weakness of the British supply chain, so he ordered an attack against the forts which Shirley had erected at the Oneida Carry. In the [[Battle of Fort Bull]], French forces destroyed the fort and large quantities of supplies, including 45,000 pounds of gunpowder. They set back any British hopes for campaigns on Lake Ontario and endangered the Oswego garrison, already short on supplies. French forces in the Ohio valley also continued to intrigue with Indians throughout the area, encouraging them to raid frontier settlements. This led to ongoing alarms along the western frontiers, with streams of refugees returning east to get away from the action.
[[File:Fort Oswego.jpg|thumb|In August 1756, French soldiers and native warriors led by [[Louis-Joseph de Montcalm]] successfully [[Battle of Fort Oswego|attacked Fort Oswego]].]]
The new British command was not in place until July. Abercrombie arrived in Albany but refused to take any significant actions until Loudoun approved them, and Montcalm took bold action against his inertia. He built on Vaudreuil's work harassing the Oswego garrison and executed a strategic [[feint]] by moving his headquarters to Ticonderoga, as if to presage another attack along Lake George. With Abercrombie pinned down at Albany, Montcalm slipped away and led the [[Battle of Fort Oswego|successful attack on Oswego]] in August. In the aftermath, Montcalm and the Indians under his command disagreed about the disposition of prisoners' personal effects. The Europeans did not consider them prizes and prevented the Indians from stripping the prisoners of their valuables, which angered the Indians.

Loudoun was a capable administrator but a cautious field commander, and he planned one major operation for 1757: an attack on New France's capital of [[Quebec]]. He left a sizable force at Fort William Henry to distract Montcalm and began organizing for the expedition to Quebec. He was then ordered to attack Louisbourg first by William Pitt, the [[Secretary of State for the Southern Department|Secretary of State]] responsible for the colonies. The expedition was beset by delays of all kinds but was finally ready to sail from [[City of Halifax|Halifax, Nova Scotia]], in early August. In the meantime, French ships had escaped the British blockade of the French coast, and a fleet awaited Loudoun at Louisbourg which outnumbered the British fleet. Faced with this strength, Loudoun returned to New York amid news that [[Battle of Fort William Henry|a massacre had occurred at Fort William Henry]].
[[File:Montcalm trying to stop the massacre.jpg|thumb|left|Montcalm attempts to stop native warriors from attacking the British. A number of British soldiers were killed after the [[Siege of Fort William Henry]].]]
French irregular forces (Canadian scouts and Indians) harassed Fort William Henry throughout the first half of 1757. In January, they [[Battle on Snowshoes (1757)|ambushed British rangers]] near Ticonderoga. In February, they launched a raid against the position across the frozen Lake George, destroying storehouses and buildings outside the main fortification. In early August, Montcalm and 7,000 troops besieged the fort, which capitulated with an agreement to withdraw under parole. When the withdrawal began, some of Montcalm's Indian allies attacked the British column because they were angry about the lost opportunity for loot, killing and capturing several hundred men, women, children, and slaves. The aftermath of the siege may have contributed to the transmission of [[smallpox]] into remote Indian populations, as some Indians were reported to have traveled from beyond the Mississippi to participate in the campaign and returned afterward. Modern writer William Nester believes that the Indians might have been exposed to European carriers, although no proof exists.<ref>Nester, pp. 53–61</ref>

===British conquest, 1758–1760===
{{see also|Great Britain in the Seven Years' War#Conquest of Canada (1758–60)}}
Vaudreuil and Montcalm were minimally resupplied in 1758, as the British blockade of the French coastline limited French shipping. The situation in New France was further exacerbated by a poor harvest in 1757, a difficult winter, and the allegedly corrupt machinations of [[François Bigot]], the [[Intendant of New France|intendant of the territory]]. His schemes to supply the colony inflated prices and were believed by Montcalm to line his pockets and those of his associates. A massive outbreak of [[smallpox]] among western Indian tribes led many of them to stay away from trading in 1758. The disease probably spread through the crowded conditions at William Henry after the battle;<ref name="Fowler138">Fowler, p. 138.</ref> yet the Indians blamed the French for bringing "bad medicine" as well as denying them prizes at Fort William Henry.

Montcalm focused his meager resources on the defense of the St. Lawrence, with primary defenses at Carillon, Quebec, and Louisbourg, while Vaudreuil argued unsuccessfully for a continuation of the raiding tactics that had worked quite effectively in previous years.<ref name="Fowler139">Fowler, p. 139.</ref> The British failures in North America combined with other failures in the European theater and led to Newcastle's fall from power along with the Duke of Cumberland, his principal military advisor.

Newcastle and Pitt [[Pitt–Newcastle ministry|joined in an uneasy coalition]] in which Pitt dominated the military planning. He embarked on a plan for the 1758 campaign that was largely developed by Loudoun. He had been replaced by Abercrombie as commander in chief after the failures of 1757. Pitt's plan called for three major offensive actions involving large numbers of regular troops supported by the provincial militias, aimed at capturing the heartlands of New France. Two of the expeditions were successful, with [[Battle of Fort Duquesne|Fort Duquesne]] and [[Siege of Louisbourg (1758)|Louisbourg]] falling to sizable British forces.

====1758====
The [[Forbes Expedition]] was a British campaign in September–October 1758, with 6,000 troops led by General [[John Forbes (British Army officer)|John Forbes]] sent to drive out the French from the contested Ohio Country. The French withdrew from Fort Duquesne and left the British in control of the Ohio River Valley.<ref>{{cite book |first=Fred |last=Anderson |title=Crucible of War: The Seven Years' War and the Fate of Empire in British North America, 1754–1766 |year=2000 |location=New York |publisher=Alfred A.

[[File:La victoire des troupes de Montcalm à Carillon.JPG|left|thumb|A British expedition sent to invade [[Canada (New France)|Canada]] was repulsed by the French at the [[Battle of Carillon]] in July 1758.]]
The third invasion was stopped with the improbable French victory in the [[Battle of Carillon]], in which 3,600 Frenchmen defeated Abercrombie's force of 18,000 regulars, militia, and Indian allies outside the fort which the French called Carillon and the British called Ticonderoga. Abercrombie saved something from the disaster when he sent [[John Bradstreet]] on an expedition that successfully [[Battle of Fort Frontenac|destroyed Fort Frontenac]], including caches of supplies destined for New France's western forts and furs destined for Europe. Abercrombie was recalled and replaced by [[Jeffery Amherst, 1st Baron Amherst|Jeffery Amherst]], victor at Louisbourg.

The French had generally poor results in 1758 in most theaters of the war. The new foreign minister was the [[Étienne François, duc de Choiseul|duc de Choiseul]], and he decided to focus on an [[Planned French Invasion of Britain (1759)|invasion of Britain]] to draw British resources away from North America and the European mainland. The invasion failed both militarily and politically, as Pitt again planned significant campaigns against New France and sent funds to Britain's mainland ally of Prussia, while the French Navy failed in the 1759 naval battles at [[Battle of Lagos|Lagos]] and [[Battle of Quiberon Bay|Quiberon Bay]]. In one piece of good fortune, some French supply ships did manage to depart France and elude the British blockade of the French coast.

====1759–1760====
{{see also|Conquest of 1760}}
[[File:PlainsOfAbraham2007.jpg|thumb|After a three-month siege of Quebec City, British forces captured the city at the [[Battle of the Plains of Abraham|Plains of Abraham]].]]
British victories continued in all theaters in a year later called the [[Annus Mirabilis of 1759|Annus Mirabilis]]. The British proceeded to wage a campaign in the northwest frontier of Canada in an effort to cut off the French frontier forts to the west and south. The British [[Battle of Ticonderoga (1759)|captured Ticonderoga]], [[Battle of Fort Niagara|Fort Niagara]], as well as the defeat of the French at the [[Battle of the Thousand Islands|Thousand Islands]] in the summer of 1759. In September 1759, [[James Wolfe]] defeated Montcalm at the [[Battle of the Plains of Abraham]], in a battle that claimed the lives of both commanders. Subsequently after the battle, the [[Articles of Capitulation of Quebec|city was capitulated to the British]]. 

In April 1760, [[François Gaston de Lévis]] led French forces in an [[Battle of Sainte-Foy|attempt to retake the city]]. Although victorious in battle, French attempts to retake Quebec City was prevented with the British [[Battle of the Restigouche|naval victory at Restigouche]], a naval battle that saw the loss of French ships meant to resupply Lévis' army.

===Sporadic engagements, 1760–1763===
Most of the fighting ended in continental North America in 1760, although it continued in Europe between France and Britain. The notable exception was the French seizure of [[St. John's, Newfoundland]]. General Amherst heard of this surprise action and immediately dispatched troops under his nephew [[William Amherst (British Army officer)|William Amherst]], who regained control of Newfoundland after the [[Battle of Signal Hill]] in September 1762.<ref>Anderson (2000), p. 498</ref> Many troops from North America were reassigned to participate in further British actions in the West Indies, including the [[Battle of Havana (1762)|capture of Spanish Havana]] when Spain belatedly entered the conflict on the side of France, and a [[British expedition against Martinique (1762)|British expedition against French Martinique]] in 1762 led by Major General [[Robert Monckton]].<ref name=Cave21>Cave, p. 21</ref>

==Peace==
[[File:Capitulation Montreal.jpg|thumb|French authorities surrendering Montreal to British forces in 1760.]]
Governor Vaudreuil in Montreal [[Articles of Capitulation of Montreal|negotiated a capitulation]] with [[Jeffery Amherst, 1st Baron Amherst|General Amherst]] in September 1760. Amherst granted his requests that any French residents who chose to remain in the colony would be given freedom to continue worshiping in their [[Roman Catholic]] tradition, to own property, and to remain undisturbed in their homes. The British provided medical treatment for the sick and wounded French soldiers, and [[French Army|French regular troops]] were returned to France aboard British ships with an agreement that they were not to serve again in the present war.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://frenchandindianwar.info/treatyofparis.htm|title= Treaty of Paris February 10, 1763|last1= |first1= |last2= |first2= |date= |website= FrenchandIndianWar.info|publisher= |accessdate= January 21, 2015}}</ref>

General Amherst also oversaw the transition of French forts to British control in the western lands. The policies which he introduced in those lands disturbed large numbers of Indians and contributed to [[Pontiac's Rebellion]] in 1763.<ref>Jennings, p. 439</ref> This series of attacks on frontier forts and settlements required the continued deployment of British troops, and it was not resolved until 1766.<ref>Anderson (2000), pp. 617–632</ref>

The war in North America officially ended with the signing of the [[Treaty of Paris (1763)|Treaty of Paris]] on 10 February 1763, and war in the European theater was settled by the [[Treaty of Hubertusburg]] on 15 February 1763. The British offered France the choice of surrendering either its continental North American possessions east of the Mississippi or the Caribbean islands of [[Guadeloupe]] and [[Martinique]], which had been occupied by the British. France chose to cede the former but was able to negotiate the retention of [[Saint Pierre and Miquelon]], two small islands in the Gulf of St. Lawrence, along with fishing rights in the area. They viewed the economic value of the Caribbean islands' sugar cane to be greater and easier to defend than the furs from the continent. French philosopher [[Voltaire]] referred to Canada disparagingly as nothing more than [[a few acres of snow]]. The British, however, were happy to take New France, as defence of their North American colonies would no longer be an issue; they also had ample places from which to obtain sugar. Spain traded Florida to Britain in order to regain Cuba, but they also gained Louisiana from France, including New Orleans, in compensation for their losses. Great Britain and Spain also agreed that navigation on the [[Mississippi River]] was to be open to vessels of all nations.<ref>Anderson (2000), pp. 505–506</ref>

==Consequences==
[[File:NorthAmerica1763-A.png|thumb|upright=1.5|The resulting peace dramatically changed the political landscape of North America, with [[New France]] ceded to the British and the Spanish.]]
The war changed economic, political, governmental, and social relations among the three European powers, their colonies, and the people who inhabited those territories. France and Britain both suffered financially because of the war, with significant long-term consequences.

Britain gained control of [[Canada (New France)|French Canada]] and Acadia, colonies containing approximately 80,000 primarily French-speaking Roman Catholic residents. The [[Expulsion of the Acadians|deportation of Acadians]] beginning in 1755 made land available to immigrants from Europe and migrants from the colonies to the south. The British resettled many Acadians throughout its American provinces, but many went to France and some went to New Orleans, which they had expected to remain French. Some were sent to colonize places as diverse as [[French Guiana]] and the [[Falkland Islands]], but these efforts were unsuccessful. Others migrated to places such as [[Saint-Domingue]] or fled to New Orleans after the [[Haitian Revolution]]. The Louisiana population contributed to the founding of the modern [[Cajun]] population. (The French word "Acadien" changed to "Cadien" then to "Cajun".)<ref name="Calloway161_164">Calloway, pp. 161–164</ref>

Following the treaty, [[George III of the United Kingdom|King George III]] issued the [[Royal Proclamation of 1763]] on October 7, 1763 which outlined the division and administration of the newly conquered territory, and it continues to govern relations to some extent between the government of Canada and the [[First Nations]]. Included in its provisions was the reservation of lands west of the [[Appalachian Mountains]] to its Indian population,<ref>Anderson (2000), pp. 565–566</ref> a demarcation that was only a temporary impediment to a rising tide of westward-bound settlers.<ref>Anderson (2000), pp. 636–637</ref> The proclamation also contained provisions that prevented civic participation by the Roman Catholic Canadians.<ref>Anderson (2000), p. 568</ref> 
[[File:Québec Act, 1774.jpg|thumb|left|upright|A copy of the [[Quebec Act]]. Passed in 1774, it addressed a number of grievances held by French Canadians, and natives, although angered American colonists.]]
The [[Quebec Act]] of 1774 addressed issues brought forth by Roman Catholic French Canadians from the 1763 proclamation, as well as transferred the [[Indian Reserve (1763)|Indian Reserve]] into the [[Province of Quebec (1763–1791)|Province of Quebec]]. The Act maintained French Civil law, including the [[Seigneurial system of New France|seigneurial system]], a medieval code removed from France within a generation by the [[French Revolution]]. The Quebec Act was a major concern for the largely Protestant [[Thirteen Colonies]] over the advance of "[[popery]]". The Quebec Act is typically associated with other [[Intolerable Acts]], legislation that eventually led to the [[American Revolutionary War]]. The Quebec Act served as the constitutional document for the Province of Quebec, until it was superseded by the [[Constitutional Act 1791]]. 

The Seven Years' War nearly doubled Great Britain's national debt. The Crown sought sources of revenue to pay it off and attempted to impose new taxes on its colonies. These attempts were met with increasingly stiff resistance, until troops were called in to enforce the Crown's authority. These acts ultimately led to the start of the [[American Revolutionary War]].<ref>Anderson, Fred. "[http://americanheritage.com/articles/magazine/ah/2005/6/2005_6_75.shtml The Real First World War and the Making of America] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100131072213/http://americanheritage.com/articles/magazine/ah/2005/6/2005_6_75.shtml |date=2010-01-31 }}" ''American Heritage'', November/December 2005.</ref>

France attached comparatively little value to its American possessions, apart from the highly profitable sugar-producing [[Antilles]] islands which it retained. Minister [[César Gabriel de Choiseul|Choiseul]] considered that he had made a good deal at the Treaty of Paris, and [[Voltaire]] wrote that Louis XV had lost "a few acres of snow".<ref name=Cave52>Cave, p. 52</ref> For France, however, the military defeat and the financial burden of the war weakened the monarchy and contributed to the advent of the [[French Revolution]] in 1789.<ref name=Cavexii>Cave, p. xii</ref>

For some of the Indian tribes, the elimination of French power in America meant the disappearance of a strong ally, although other tribes were not so affected.<ref name=Cavexii /> The Ohio Country was now more available to colonial settlement, due to the construction of military roads by Braddock and Forbes.<ref>Anderson (2000), p. 525</ref> The Spanish takeover of the Louisiana territory was not completed until 1769, and it had modest repercussions. The British takeover of Spanish Florida resulted in the westward migration of Indian tribes who did not want to do business with them. This migration also caused a rise in tensions between the Choctaw and the Creek, historic enemies who were now competing for land.<ref name="Calloway133_138">Calloway, pp. 133–138</ref> The change of control in Florida also prompted most of its Spanish Catholic population to leave. Most went to Cuba, including the entire governmental records from [[Saint Augustine, Florida|St. Augustine]], although some Christianized [[Yamasee]] were resettled to the coast of [[Mexico]].<ref name="Calloway152_156">Calloway, pp. 152–156</ref>

France returned to America in 1778 with the establishment of a [[Franco-American alliance]] against Great Britain in the [[American War of Independence]]. This time, France succeeded in prevailing over Britain in what historian [[Alfred A. Cave]] describes as French "revenge for Montcalm's death".<ref name=Cave82>Cave, p. 82</ref>
