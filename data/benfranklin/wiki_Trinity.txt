The [[Christian theology|Christian doctrine]] of the '''Trinity'''<!-- DO ''NOT'' ADD THE WORD "HOLY" --> ({{Lang-la|Trinitas|lit=triad}}, from {{Lang-la|trinus}} "threefold")<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/trinity|title=Definition of trinity in English|website=Oxford Dictionaries - English}}</ref> holds that [[God in Christianity|God]] is [[monotheism|one God]], but three coeternal [[consubstantial]] persons<ref>The Family Bible Encyclopedia (1972). p. 3790.</ref> or ''[[Hypostasis (philosophy and religion)|hypostases]]''<ref name="Catholic_Encyclopedia" />—the [[God the Father|Father]], the [[God the Son|Son]] ([[Jesus Christ]]), and the [[Holy Spirit in Christianity|Holy Spirit]]—as "one God in three Divine Persons". The three Persons are distinct, yet are one "substance, essence or nature" ([[homoousion|homoousios]]).<ref name="def-lateran1"/> In this context, a "nature" is ''what'' one is, whereas a "person" is ''who'' one is.<ref name="thelogy-sanity"/><ref name="understanding-trinity"/><ref name="baltimore-catechism"/> Sometimes differing views are referred to as [[nontrinitarianism|nontrinitarian]].

Trinitarianism contrasts with positions such as [[Binitarianism]] (one deity in two persons, or two deities) and [[Monarchianism]] (no pluratity of persons within God), of which [[Modalistic Monarchianism]] (one deity revealed in three modes) and [[Unitarianism]] (one deity in one person) are subsets. Additionally, the [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints|Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] believes the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost are three separate beings, two of which possess separate bodies of flesh and bones, while the Holy Ghost has only a body of spirit; and that their unity is not physical, but in purpose.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.mormon.org/beliefs/godhead|title=Godhead|website=www.mormon.org|access-date=2017-01-15}}</ref>

While scripture does not contain the word ''Trinity'',<ref>{{cite web|url=http://carm.org/christianity/christian-doctrine/word-trinity-not-bible|title=Trinity word not in Scripture|date=24 November 2008|website=carm.org}}</ref> an indication of three distinct persons can be found in {{bibleref2|1 John|5:7|NKJV|1 John 5:7}} for the validity of which exist a controversy known as [[Johannine Comma]]. Early Christian belief in the deity of Jesus Christ existed since the first century in the writings of [[John the Apostle]] ({{bibleref2|John|1:1|NKJV|John 1:1,}} {{bibleref2|John|20:28|NKJV|20:28}}), [[Paul the Apostle]] ({{bibleref2|Titus|2:13|NKJV|Titus 2:13,}} {{bibleref2|Romans|9:5|NIRV|Romans 9:5,}} {{bibleref2|Hebrews|1:8-10|NKJV|Hebrews 1:8-10}}), [[Saint Peter|Peter the Apostle]] ({{bibleref2|2 Peter|1:1|NKJV|2 Peter 1:1}}), as well as in the writings of [[Ignatius of Antioch]],<ref>Ignatius, [[To the Ephesians, 1, 7, 18, 19|''To the Ephesians'', 1, 7, 18, 19]]</ref><ref>Ignatius, [[Www.newadvent.org/fathers/0110.htm|''To Polycarp'', 3, 8]]</ref><ref>Ignatius, [http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/0109.htm ''To the Smyrnaeans'', 10]</ref><ref>Ignatius, [http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/0107.htm ''To the Romans'', 6]</ref><ref>Ignatius, [http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/0105.htm ''To the Magnesians'', 8]</ref> a disciple of John who was born about the beginning of the Apostolic age (c. 35). Jesus is also quoted as attesting to being one with and equal with the Father, sharing in the glory of the Father before the world began ({{bibleref2|John|8:58|NKJV|John 8:58}}, {{bibleref2|John|10:30|NKJV|10:30}}, {{bibleref2|John|17:5|NKJV|17:5}}).

== Etymology ==
The word ''trinity'' is derived from [[Latin]] ''[[wikt:trinitas|trinitas]]'', meaning "the number three, a triad, tri". This abstract noun is formed from the adjective ''trinus'' (three each, threefold, triple),<ref name="lewis-short"/> as the word ''unitas'' is the abstract noun formed from ''unus'' (one).

The corresponding word in [[Greek language|Greek]] is [[wikt:τριάς|τριάς]], meaning "a set of three" or "the number three".<ref name="greek-lexicon"/> The first recorded use of this Greek word in Christian theology was by [[Theophilus of Antioch]] in about the year 170. He wrote:<ref name="to-autolycus"/><ref name="Fulton"/>
<blockquote>
In like manner also the three days which were before the luminaries, are [[Typology (theology)|types]] of the Trinity [{{lang|grc|Τριάδος}}], of God, and [[Logos (Christianity)|His Word]], and [[Wisdom of God|His wisdom]]. And the fourth is the type of man, who needs light, that so there may be God, the Word, wisdom, man.<ref name="theandros"/>
</blockquote>

[[Tertullian]], a Latin theologian who wrote in the early 3rd century, is credited as being the first to use the Latin words "Trinity",<ref name="against-praxeas1"/> "person" and "substance"<ref name="against-praxeas2"/> to explain that the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit are "''tres [[persona]]e, [[Consubstantial|una substantia]]''".<ref name="hist-doctrine"/> While "personae" is often translated as "persons," the Latin word [[persona]]e is better understood as referring to roles as opposed to individual centers of consciousness.

The [[Ante-Nicene Period|Ante-Nicene]] [[Church Fathers|Fathers]] asserted Christ's deity and spoke of "Father, Son and Holy Spirit", even though their language is not that of the traditional doctrine as formalized in the fourth century. Trinitarians view these as elements of the codified doctrine.<ref name="dogmatiki"/> [[Ignatius of Antioch]] provides early support for the Trinity around 110,<ref name="eusebius"/> exhorting obedience to "Christ, and to the Father, and to the Spirit".<ref name="ignatius"/> [[Justin Martyr]] (AD 100–c. 165) also writes, "in the name of God, the Father and Lord of the universe, and of our Saviour Jesus Christ, and of the Holy Spirit".<ref name="first-apology"/> The first of the early church fathers to be recorded using the word "Trinity" was [[Theophilus of Antioch]] writing in the late 2nd century. He defines the Trinity as God, His Word (''Logos'') and His Wisdom (''Sophia'')<ref name="theophilus2"/> in the context of a discussion of the first three days of creation, following the early Christian practice of identifying the Holy Spirit as the Wisdom of God.<ref>Theophilus, ''To Autolycus'', 1.7 Cf. Irenaeus, ''Against Heresies'', 4.20.1, 3; ''Demonstration of the Apostolic Preaching'', 5</ref> The first defense of the doctrine of the Trinity was in the early 3rd century by the early church father [[Tertullian]].

Fourth-century theologian [[Marcellus of Ancyra]] attributes an earlier formulation of the Trinity to the [[Gnostic]] teacher [[Valentinus (Gnostic)|Valentinus]] (lived c.100 – c.160), whom he identifies as “the first to devise the notion of three subsistent entities ([[hypostases]]) . . . in a work that he entitled ''On the Three Natures''," which he says Valentinus "filched from Hermes and Plato''."'' This statement is problematic, however, in that Marcellus was known for launching unsubstantiated attacks against his opponents,<ref>See Eusebius, ''Contra Marcellum'', Book 1</ref> and his statements contradict existing evidence. In the work cited by him, ''On the Three Natures'', the three natures are the three natures of mankind, not Deity.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Encyclopedia Britannica, 11th Edition|last=|first=|work=Valentinus|publisher=Cambridge|year=1911|isbn=|location=|pages=854}}</ref><ref>Concerning this, Irenaeus writes, "They conceive, then, of three kinds of men, spiritual, material, and animal, represented by Cain, Abel, and Seth. These three natures are no longer found in one person,  but constitute various kinds [of men]. The material goes, as a matter of course, into corruption." ([http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/0103107.htm Against Heresies, 1.7.5])</ref> Likewise, Irenaeus indicates that Valentinus believed in the pre-existent Aeon known as Proarche, Propator, and Bythus who existed alongside Ennœa, and they together begot Monogenes and Aletheia: and these constituted first-begotten Pythagorean Tetrad, from whom thirty Aeons were produced.<ref>Irenaeus, Against Heresies, 1.1.1-3</ref>

Although there is much debate as to whether the beliefs of the [[Apostles]] were merely articulated and explained in the Trinitarian Creeds,<ref name="JBing" /> or were corrupted and replaced with new beliefs,<ref name="americana"/><ref name="dictionnnaire"/> all scholars recognize that the Creeds themselves were created in reaction to disagreements over the nature of the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. These controversies took some centuries to be resolved.

Of these controversies, the most significant developments were articulated in the first four centuries by the [[Church Fathers]]<ref name="JBing"/> in reaction to [[Adoptionism]], [[Sabellianism]], and [[Arianism]]. Adoptionism was the belief that Jesus was an ordinary man, born of Joseph and Mary, who became the Christ and Son of God at his baptism. In 269, the [[Synods of Antioch]] condemned [[Paul of Samosata]] for his Adoptionist theology, and also condemned the term ''[[homoousios]]'' (ὁμοούσιος, "of the same being") in the modalist sense in which he used it.<ref name="cathenc-paul"/>

Among the [[Nontrinitarianism#Beliefs|Non-Trinitarian beliefs]], the [[Sabellianism]] taught that the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit are essentially one and the same, the difference being simply verbal, describing different aspects or roles of a single being.<ref name="chadwick"/> For this view Sabellius was excommunicated for [[Heresy#Christianity|heresy]] in Rome c. 220.

In the fourth century, [[Arianism]], as traditionally understood,<ref group="note">Very little of [[Arius]]' own writings have survived. We depend largely on quotations made by opponents which reflect what they thought he was saying. Furthermore, there was no single Arian party or agenda but rather various critics of the Nicene formula working from distinct perspectives.(see Williams, Rowan. ''Arius'' SPCK (2nd edn, 2001) p.95ff & pp.247ff)</ref>  taught that the Father existed prior to the Son who was not, by nature, God but rather a changeable creature who was granted the dignity of becoming "Son of God".<ref name="oxford-arianism"/> In 325, the [[First Council of Nicaea|Council of Nicaea]] adopted the [[Nicene Creed]] which described Christ as "God of God, Light of Light, very God of very God, begotten, not made, being of one substance with the Father", and the "Holy Ghost" as the one by which [[Incarnation (Christianity)|was incarnate]]... of the [[Virgin birth of Jesus|Virgin Mary]]".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/creeds1.iv.iii.html|title=Creeds of Christendom, with a History and Critical notes.

About the Father and the Son, the creed used the term ''homoousios'' (of one substance) to define the relationship between the Father and the Son. After more than fifty years of debate, ''homoousios'' was recognised as the hallmark of orthodoxy, and was further developed into the formula of "three persons, one being".

The third [[Council of Sirmium]], in 357, was the high point of Arianism. The Seventh Arian Confession (Second Sirmium Confession) held that both ''homoousios'' (of one substance) and ''homoiousios'' (of similar substance) were unbiblical and that the Father is greater than the Son. (This confession was later known as the Blasphemy of Sirmium)

<blockquote>
But since many persons are disturbed by questions concerning what is called in Latin ''substantia'', but in Greek ''ousia'', that is, to make it understood more exactly, as to 'coessential,' or what is called, 'like-in-essence,' there ought to be no mention of any of these at all, nor exposition of them in the Church, for this reason and for this consideration, that in divine Scripture nothing is written about them, and that they are above men's knowledge and above men's understanding;<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.fourthcentury.com/index.php/second-creed-of-sirmium-or-the-blasphemy-of-sirmium/|title=Second Creed of Sirmium or "The Blasphemy of Sirmium"|website=www.fourthcentury.com|access-date=2017-03-09}}</ref></blockquote>

[[Athanasius of Alexandria|Athanasius]] (293–373), who was present at the Council as one of the Bishop of Alexandria's assistants, stated that the bishops were forced to use this terminology,<ref name="athanasius"/> which is not found in Scripture, because the biblical phrases that they would have preferred to use were claimed by the [[Arianism|Arians]] to be capable of being interpreted in what the bishops considered to be a heretical sense.<ref name="dedecretis"/> Moreover, the meanings of "''ousia''" and "''[[Hypostasis (philosophy and religion)|hypostasis]]''" overlapped then, so that "''hypostasis''" for some meant "''essence''" and for others "''person''".

The Confession of the Council of Nicaea, the Nicene Creed, said little about the Holy Spirit.<ref name="BEoWR"/> At the First Council of Nicea (325) all attention was focused on the relationship between the Father and the Son, without making any similar statement about the Holy Spirit:

:We believe in one God, the Father Almighty, Maker of all things visible and invisible. And in one Lord Jesus Christ, the Son of God, begotten of the Father [the only-begotten; that is, of the essence of the Father, God of God,] Light of Light, very God of very God, begotten, not made, being of one substance with the Father; (...) And [we believe] in the Holy Ghost. (...). — Nicene Creed

Later, at the [[First Council of Constantinople]] (381), the Nicene Creed would be expanded, known as Niceno-Constantinopolitan Creed, by saying that the Holy Spirit is worshiped and glorified together with the Father and the Son (συμπροσκυνούμενον καὶ συνδοξαζόμενον), suggesting that he was also consubstantial with them:

:We believe in one God, the Father Almighty, Maker of heaven and earth, and of all things visible and invisible. And in one Lord Jesus Christ, the only-begotten Son of God, begotten of the Father before all worlds (æons), Light of Light, very God of very God, begotten, not made, being of one substance with the Father; (...) And in the Holy Ghost, the Lord and Giver of life, who proceedeth from the Father, who with the Father and the Son together is worshiped and glorified, who spake by the prophets (...). — Niceno-Constantinopolitan Creed.<ref>See [http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/creeds1.iv.iii.html Creeds of Christendom].</ref>

The doctrine of the divinity and personality of the Holy Spirit was developed by Athanasius in the last decades of his life.<ref name="oxford-athanasius"/> He defended and refined the Nicene formula.<ref name="BEoWR" /> By the end of the 4th century, under the leadership of [[Basil of Caesarea]], [[Gregory of Nyssa]], and [[Gregory of Nazianzus]] (the [[Cappadocian Fathers]]), the doctrine had reached substantially its current form.<ref name="BEoWR"/>

In the late 6th century, some Latin-speaking churches added the words "and from the Son" (''[[Filioque]]'') to the description of the procession of the Holy Spirit, words that were not included in the text by either the Council of Nicaea or that of Constantinople.<ref>For a different view, see e.g. [http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/npnf214.x.xvi.xi.html Excursus on the Words πίστιν ἑτέραν]</ref> This was incorporated into the liturgical practice of Rome in 1014.<ref>{{cite book |title=Greek and Latin Traditions on Holy Spirit |url=http://www.ewtn.com/library/CURIA/PCCUFILQ.HTM |accessdate=18 January 2019}}</ref>''Filioque'' eventually became one of the main causes for the [[East-West Schism]] in 1054, and the failures of the repeated union attempts.

Gregory of Nazianzus would say of the Trinity, "No sooner do I conceive of the One than I am illumined by the splendour of the Three; no sooner do I distinguish Three than I am carried back into the One. When I think of any of the Three, I think of Him as the Whole, and my eyes are filled, and the greater part of what I am thinking escapes me. I cannot grasp the greatness of that One so as to attribute a greater greatness to the rest. When I contemplate the Three together, I see but one torch, and cannot divide or measure out the undivided light."<ref>Gregory of Nazianzus, Orations 40.41</ref>

Devotion to the Trinity centered in the French monasteries at Tours and Aniane where [[Benedict of Aniane|Saint Benedict]] dedicated the abbey church to the Trinity in 872.<ref>Mulhern, 306.</ref> Feast Days were not instituted until 1091 at [[Cluny Abbey|Cluny]] and 1162 at Canterbury and papal resistance continued until 1331.<ref>Mulhern, p.306</ref>

=== Trinitarian baptismal formula ===
[[File:Piero, battesimo di cristo 04.jpg|thumb|''[[The Baptism of Christ (Piero della Francesca)|The Baptism of Christ]]'', by [[Piero della Francesca]], 15th century]]{{Main|Trinitarian formula}}
Many scholars interpret the [[baptism of Jesus]] in the [[synoptic Gospel]]s as a manifestation of all three persons of the Trinity: "And when Jesus was baptized, he went up immediately from the water, and behold, the heavens were opened and he saw the spirit of God descending like a dove, and alighting on him; and lo, a voice from heaven, saying, 'This is my beloved Son, with whom I am well pleased.{{'"}}{{bibleref2c|Mt|3:16–17}}
Baptism is generally conferred with the [[Trinitarian formula]], "in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit".{{bibleref2c|Mt|28:19}} Trinitarians identify this name with the Christian faith into which baptism is an initiation, as seen for example in the statement of [[Basil the Great]] (330–379): "We are bound to be baptized in the terms we have received, and to profess faith in the terms in which we have been baptized." The [[First Council of Constantinople]] (381) also says, "This is the Faith of our baptism that teaches us to believe in the Name of the Father, of the Son and of the Holy Spirit. According to this Faith there is one Godhead, Power, and Being of the Father, of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit." {{bibleref2|Matthew|28:19}} may be taken to indicate that baptism was associated with this formula from the earliest decades of the Church's existence.

[[Oneness Pentecostals]] demur from the Trinitarian view of baptism and emphasize baptism ‘in the name of Jesus Christ’ as the original apostolic formula.<ref>Wolfgang Vondey, Pentecostalism, A Guide for the Perplexed (London; New Delhi; New York; Sydney: Bloomsbury, 2013), 78.</ref>   For this reason, they often focus on the baptisms in Acts. Those who place great emphasis on the baptisms in Acts often likewise question the authenticity of {{bibleref2|Matthew|28:19}} in its present form. Most scholars of New Testament [[textual criticism]] accept the authenticity of the passage, since there are no variant manuscripts regarding the formula, and the extant form of the passage is attested in the [[Didache]]<ref name="patristics"/> and other [[patristic]] works of the 1st and 2nd centuries: [[Ignatius of Antioch|Ignatius]],<ref name="patristics1"/> [[Tertullian]],<ref name="patristics2"/> [[Hippolytus (writer)|Hippolytus]],<ref name="patristics3"/> [[Cyprian]],<ref name="patristics4"/> and [[Gregory Thaumaturgus]].<ref name="patristics5"/>

Commenting on {{bibleref2|Matthew|28:19}}, Gerhard Kittel states:
<blockquote>This threefold relation [of Father, Son and Spirit] soon found fixed expression in the triadic formulae in {{bibleref2|2 Cor.|13:14|KJV}} and in {{bibleref2|1Cor|12:4–6||1 Cor. 12:4–6}}. The form is first found in the baptismal formula in {{bibleref2|Matthew|28:19}}; Did., 7. 1 and 3....[I]t is self-evident that Father, Son and Spirit are here linked in an indissoluble threefold relationship.<ref name="kittel3"/></blockquote>

=== Fundamental monotheism ===
{{Main|Monotheism}}
Christianity, having emerged from [[Judaism]], is a monotheistic religion. According to Baptist theologian [[Frank Stagg (theologian)|Frank Stagg]] never in the New Testament does the Trinitarian concept become a "[[tritheism]]" (three Gods) nor even two.<ref name="Stagg"/> God is one, and that God is a single being is declared in the Bible:

* The ''[[Shema]]'' of the Hebrew Scriptures: "Hear, O Israel: [[the Lord|the {{Lord}}]] our God, the {{Lord}} is one."{{bibleref2c|Deut|6:4}}
* The first of the [[Ten Commandments]]—"Thou shalt have no other gods before me."{{bibleref2c-nb|Deut|5:7}}
* And "Thus saith the {{Lord}} the King of Israel and his redeemer the {{Lord}} of hosts: I am the first and I am the last; and beside me there is no God."{{bibleref2c|Isa|44:6}}
* In the New Testament: "The {{Lord}} our God is one."{{Bibleref2c|Mk|12:29}}

In the Trinitarian view, the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit share the one essence, substance or being. The central and crucial affirmation of Christian faith is that there is one savior, God, and one salvation, manifest in Jesus Christ, to which there is access only because of the Holy Spirit. The God of the Old Testament is still the same as the God of the New. In Christianity, statements about a single God are intended to distinguish the Hebraic understanding from the [[polytheism|polytheistic]] view, which see divine power as shared by several beings, beings which can and do disagree and have conflicts with each other.

In Trinitarian doctrine, God exists as three persons or hypostases, but is one being, having a single divine nature.<ref name="grudem-intro"/> The members of the Trinity are co-equal and co-eternal, one in essence, nature, power, action, and will. As stated in the [[Athanasian Creed]], the Father is uncreated, the Son is uncreated, and the Holy Spirit is uncreated, and all three are eternal without beginning.<ref name="athanasian-creed"/> "The Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit" are not names for different parts of God, but one name for God<ref name="prolegomena"/> because three persons exist in God as one entity.<ref name="Auto4B-36"/> They cannot be separate from one another. Each person is understood as having the identical essence or nature, not merely similar natures.<ref name="de-smet"/>

According to the [[Eleventh Council of Toledo]] (675) "For, when we say: He who is the Father is not the Son, we refer to the distinction of persons; but when we say: the Father is that which the Son is, the Son that which the Father is, and the Holy Spirit that which the Father is and the Son is, this clearly refers to the nature or substance"<ref>{{cite book |title=Toledo-11 |publisher=THE ELEVENTH COUNCIL OF TOLEDO (675) |url=https://www.ewtn.com/library/COUNCILS/TOLEDO.HTM |accessdate=11 January 2019}}</ref>

The [[Fourth Lateran Council]] (1215) adds: "In God there is only a Trinity since each of the three persons is that reality — that is to say substance, essence or divine nature. This reality neither begets nor is begotten nor proceeds; the Father begets, the Son is begotten and the holy Spirit proceeds. Thus there is a distinction of persons but a unity of nature. Although therefore the Father is one person, the Son another person and the holy Spirit another person, they are not different realities, but rather that which is the Father is the Son and the holy Spirit, altogether the same; thus according to the orthodox and catholic faith they are believed to be consubstantial."<ref>{{cite book |title=FOURTH LATERAN COUNCIL (1215) List of Constitutions: 2.

=== ''Perichoresis'' ===
{{main|Perichoresis}}
[[File:THE_FIRST_COUNCIL_OF_NICEA.jpg|thumb| A depiction of the [[First Council of Nicaea|Council of Nicaea]] in AD 325, at which the Deity of Christ was declared orthodox and [[Arianism]] condemned]]
''[[Perichoresis]]'' (from [[Greek language|Greek]], "going around", "envelopment") is a term used by some scholars to describe the relationship among the members of the Trinity. The Latin equivalent for this term is ''circumincessio''. This concept refers for its basis to {{bibleref2|John|14–17}}, where Jesus is instructing the disciples concerning the meaning of his departure. His going to the Father, he says, is for their sake; so that he might come to them when the "other comforter" is given to them. Then, he says, his disciples will dwell in him, as he dwells in the Father, and the Father dwells in him, and the Father will dwell in them. This is so, according to the theory of ''perichoresis'', because the persons of the Trinity "reciprocally contain one another, so that one permanently envelopes and is permanently enveloped by, the other whom he yet envelopes". ([[Hilary of Poitiers]], ''Concerning the Trinity'' 3:1).<ref name="hilary-john"/>

''Perichoresis'' effectively excludes the idea that God has parts, but rather is a [[divine simplicity|simple being]]. It also harmonizes well with the doctrine that the Christian's union with the Son in his humanity brings him into union with one who contains in himself, in the [[Paul the Apostle|Apostle Paul]]'s words, "all the fullness of deity" and not a part. (''See also: [[Divinization (Christian)]]''). ''Perichoresis'' provides an intuitive figure of what this might mean. The Son, the eternal Word, is from all eternity the dwelling place of God; he is the "Father's house", just as the Son dwells in the Father and the Spirit; so that, when the Spirit is "given", then it happens as Jesus said, "I will not leave you as orphans; for I will come to you."{{bibleref2c|John|14:18}}

According to the words of Jesus, married persons are in some sense no longer two but are joined into one. Therefore, Orthodox theologians also see the marriage relationship between a man and a woman to be an example of this sacred union. "Therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother, and shall cleave unto his wife: and they shall be one flesh." Gen. 2:24. "Wherefore they are no more twain but one flesh. What therefore God hath joined together, let no man put asunder." Matt. 19: 6.{{bibleref2c|image or "icon"|17:22}}

=== Eternal generation and procession ===
{{further|Filioque}}
Trinitarianism affirms that the Son is "begotten" (or "generated") of the Father and that the Spirit "proceeds" from the Father, but the Father is "neither begotten nor proceeds". The argument over whether the Spirit proceeds from the Father alone, or from the Father and the Son, was one of the catalysts of the [[East-West Schism|Great Schism]], in this case concerning the Western addition of the [[Filioque clause]] to the [[Nicene Creed]]. The [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic Church]] teaches that, in the sense of the [[Latin]] verb ''procedere'' (which does not have to indicate ultimate origin and is therefore compatible with proceeding ''through''), but not in that of the Greek verb ἐκπορεύεσθαι (which implies ultimate origin),<ref name="losservatore95"/> the Spirit "proceeds" from the Father and the Son, and the Eastern Orthodox Church, which teaches that the Spirit "proceeds" from the Father alone, has made no statement on the claim of a difference in meaning between the two words, one Greek and one Latin, both of which are translated as "proceeds". The [[Eastern Orthodox Church]]es object to the Filioque clause on ecclesiological and theological grounds, holding that "from the Father" means "from the Father alone".

This language is often considered difficult because, if used regarding humans or other created things, it would imply time and change; when used here, no beginning, change in being, or process within time is intended and is excluded. The Son is generated ("born" or "begotten"), and the Spirit proceeds, eternally. [[Augustine of Hippo]] explains, "Thy years are one day, and Thy day is not daily, but today; because Thy today yields not to tomorrow, for neither does it follow yesterday. Thy today is eternity; therefore Thou begat the Co-eternal, to whom Thou saidst, 'This day have I begotten Thee.'"{{bibleref2c|Ps|2:7}}

Most Protestant groups that use the creed also include the Filioque clause. Its controversial use is addressed in several [[Confessionalism (religion)|confessions]]: the [[Westminster Confession]] 2:3, the [[Baptist Confession of Faith|London Baptist Confession]] 2:3, and the Lutheran [[Augsburg Confession]] 1:1–6.

=== Economic and immanent Trinity ===
{{POV section|date=June 2016}}
The term "immanent Trinity" focuses on who God is; the term “economic Trinity” focuses on what God does.

According to the ''Catechism of the Catholic Church'', <blockquote>The Fathers of the Church distinguish between theology (''theologia'') and economy (''oikonomia''). "Theology" refers to the mystery of God's inmost life within the Blessed Trinity and "economy" to all the works by which God reveals himself and communicates his life. Through the ''oikonomia'' the ''theologia'' is revealed to us; but conversely, the ''theologia'' illuminates the whole ''oikonomia''. God's works reveal who he is in himself; the mystery of his inmost being enlightens our understanding of all his works. So it is, analogously, among human persons. A person discloses himself in his actions, and the better we know a person, the better we understand his actions.<ref>[http://www.vatican.va/archive/ccc_css/archive/catechism/p1s2c1p2.htm ''CCC'' §236].</ref></blockquote>

<blockquote>The whole divine economy is the common work of the three divine persons. For as the Trinity has only one and the same natures so too does it have only one and the same operation: "The Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit are not three principles of creation but one principle." However, each divine person performs the common work according to his unique personal property. Thus the Church confesses, following the New Testament, "one God and Father from whom all things are, and one Lord Jesus Christ, through whom all things are, and one Holy Spirit in whom all things are". It is above all the divine missions of the Son's Incarnation and the gift of the Holy Spirit that show forth the properties of the divine persons.<ref>[http://www.vatican.va/archive/ccc_css/archive/catechism/p1s2c1p2.htm ''CCC'' §258].</ref></blockquote>

The ancient Nicene theologians argued that everything the Trinity does is done by Father, Son, and Spirit working in unity with one will. The three persons of the Trinity always work inseparably, for their work is always the work of the one God. The Son's will cannot be different from the Father's because it is the Father's. They have but one will as they have but one being. Otherwise they would not be one God. According to [[Phillip Cary]], if there were relations of command and obedience between the Father and the Son, there would be no Trinity at all but rather three gods.<ref name="priscilla20"/> On this point [[St. Basil]] said: {{quote|When then He says, 'I have not spoken of myself', and again, 'As the Father said unto me, so I speak', and 'The word which ye hear is not mine, but [the Father's] which sent me', and in another place, 'As the Father gave me commandment, even so I do', it is not because He lacks deliberate purpose or power of initiation, nor yet because He has to wait for the preconcerted key-note, that he employs language of this kind. His object is to make it plain that His own will is connected in indissoluble union with the Father. Do not then let us understand by what is called a 'commandment' a peremptory mandate delivered by organs of speech, and giving orders to the Son, as to a subordinate, concerning what He ought to do. Let us rather, in a sense befitting the Godhead, perceive a transmission of will, like the reflexion of an object in a mirror, passing without note of time from Father to Son.<ref name="despiritu"/>}}

According to [[Thomas Aquinas]] the Son prayed to the Father, became a minor to the angels, became incarnate, obeyed the Father as to his human nature, as to his divine nature the Son remained God: "Thus, then, the fact that the Father glorifies, raises up, and exalts the Son does not show that the Son is less than the Father, except in His human nature. For, in the divine nature by which He is equal to the Father, the power of the Father and the Son is the same and their operation is the same."<ref>{{cite book |last1=Aquinas |first1=Thomas |title=Summa Contra Gentiles Book Four Chapter 8 |url=https://dhspriory.org/thomas/ContraGentiles4.htm#8 |accessdate=11 January 2019}}</ref> 

[[File:Hierarch panagia episcopi cropped.jpg|thumb|A Greek [[fresco]] of Athanasius of Alexandria, the chief architect of the [[Nicene Creed]], formulated at Nicaea.]]
[[Athanasius of Alexandria]] explained that the Son is eternally one in being with the Father, temporally and voluntarily subordinate in his incarnate ministry.<ref name="athanasius3"/> Such human traits, he argued, were not to be read back into the eternal Trinity. Likewise, the [[Cappadocian Fathers]] also insisted there was no economic inequality present within the Trinity. As Basil wrote: "We perceive the operation of the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit to be one and the same, in no respect showing differences or variation; from this identity of operation we necessarily infer the unity of nature."<ref name="basil"/>

The traditional theory of "appropriation" consists in attributing certain names, qualities, or operations to one of the Persons of the Trinity, not, however, to the exclusion of the others, but in preference to the others. This theory was established by the Latin Fathers of the fourth and fifth centuries, especially by [[Hilary of Poitiers]], [[Augustine of Hippo|Augustine]], and [[Leo the Great]]. In the Middle Ages, the theory was systematically taught by the [[Scholasticism|Schoolmen]] such as [[Bonaventure]].<ref>[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01658a.htm Sauvage, George. "Appropriation."

=== Trinity and love ===
Augustine "coupled the doctrine of the Trinity with anthropology. Proceeding from the idea that humans are created by God according to the divine image, he attempted to explain the mystery of the Trinity by uncovering traces of the Trinity in the human personality".<ref>{{cite encyclopedia |last=Stefon |first=Matt |title=Christianity - The Holy Trinity {{!}} Attempts to define the Trinity |url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/Christianity/The-Holy-Trinity#ref67486 |encyclopedia=[[Encyclopædia Britannica]] |date=December 10, 2015}}</ref> The first key of his exegesis is an interpersonal analogy of mutual love. In ''[[On the Trinity|De trinitate]]'' (399 — 419) he wrote, {{quote|"We are now eager to see whether that most excellent love is proper to the Holy Spirit, and if it is not so, whether the Father, or the Son, or the Holy Trinity itself is love, since we cannot contradict the most certain faith and the most weighty authority of Scripture which says: 'God is love'".<ref>{{cite book |author=[[Augustine of Hippo|Augustine]] |editor-last=Matthews |editor-first=Gareth B. |others=Translated by Stephen McKenna |title=On the Trinity.

The same problem also arises in terms of the will among the commander/normer/legislator, the commanded/normed/legislated, and the process between them, and whether each person of the Trinity is ''lex sui'', i.e. a law unto himself (see [[#Trinity and will]] below).

=== Trinity and will ===
Theology professor [[Roger E. Olson]]  postulates that a number of evangelical theologians hold the view that there is a hierarchy of authority in the Trinity with the Son being [[Subordinationism|subordinate]] to the Father. "The Gospel of John makes this clear as Jesus repeatedly mentions that he came to do the Father's will."<ref name=Olsen>[http://www.patheos.com/blogs/rogereolson/2011/12/is-there-hierarchy-in-the-trinity-a-series-on-a-contemporary-evangelical-controversy/ Olsen, Roger E., "Is there hierarchy in the Trinity?", ''Patheos'', December 8, 2011].</ref> Olsen cautions, however, that the hierarchy in the "economic Trinity" should be distinguished from the "immanent Trinity". He cites the Cappadocian Fathers, "the Father is the source or "fount" of divinity within the Godhead; the Son and the Spirit derive their deity from the Father eternally (so there is no question of inequality of being). Their favorite analogy was the sun and its light and heat. There is no imagining the sun without its light and heat and yet it is the source of them."<ref name=Olsen/>

[[B. B. Warfield|Benjamin B. Warfield]] saw a principle of subordination in the "modes of operation" of the Trinity, but was also hesitant to ascribe the same to the "modes of subsistence" in relation of one to another. While noting that it is natural to see a subordination in function as reflecting a similar subordination in substance, he suggests that this might be the result of "...an agreement by Persons of the Trinity – a "Covenant" as it is technically called – by virtue of which a distinct function in the work of redemption is assumed by each".<ref>[https://books.google.com/?id=HX4PAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA3012 Warfield, Benjamin B., "Trinity", § 20, The Question of Subordination, ''The International Standard Bible Encyclopaedia, Vol. 5, (James Orr, ed.), Howard-Severance Company, 1915, pp.3020-3021].</ref>

== Biblical background ==
From the [[Old Testament]], the [[early church]] retained the conviction that [[monotheism|God is one]].<ref name="Rusch 1980 2"/> The [[New Testament]] does not use the word ''Τριάς'' (Trinity)<ref name="britannica-nt"/> nor explicitly teach the Nicene Trinitarian doctrine, but it contains several passages that use twofold and threefold patterns to speak of God. Binitarian passages include [[Epistle to the Romans|Rom.]] 8:11, [[Second Epistle to the Corinthians|2&#32;Cor.]] 4:14, [[Epistle to the Galatians|Galatians]] 1:1, [[Epistle to the Ephesians|Eph.]] 1:20, [[First Epistle to Timothy|1&#32;Tim.]] 1:2, [[First Epistle of Peter|1&#32;Pet.]] 1:21, and [[Second Epistle of John|2&#32;John]] 1:13. Passages which refer to the Godhead with a threefold pattern include [[Gospel of Matthew|Matt.]] 28:19, [[First Epistle to the Corinthians|1&#32;Cor.]] 6:11 and 12:4ff., [[Epistle to the Galatians|Gal.]] 3:11–14, [[Epistle to the Hebrews|Heb.]] 10:29, [[First Epistle of Peter|1&#32;Pet.]] 1:2 and {{bibleref2|1 John|5:7|NKJV|1 John 5:7}}. These passages provided the material with which Christians would develop doctrines of the Trinity.<ref name="Rusch 1980 2"/> Reflection by early Christians on passages such as the [[Great Commission]]: "Go therefore and make [[Disciple (Christianity)|disciples]] of all nations, [[baptizing]] them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit"{{bibleref2c|Matt|28:19}} and [[Paul the Apostle]]'s blessing: "The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ and the [[love of God]] and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit be with you all",{{bibleref2c|2 Cor.|13:14|KJV}} while at the same time the Jewish [[Shema Yisrael]]: "Hear, O Israel: The Lord is our God, the Lord alone."{{bibleref2c|Deuteronomy|6:4}}<ref name="EB"/> has led some Christians to question how the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit are "one". Eventually, the diverse references to God, Jesus, and the Spirit found in the New Testament were brought together to form the doctrine of the Trinity—one God subsisting in three persons and one [[substance theory|substance]]. The doctrine of the Trinity was used to combat heretical tendencies of how the three are related and to defend the church against charges of worshiping two or three gods.<ref name="OxfComp"/>

Some scholars dispute the idea that support for the Trinity can be found in the Bible, and argue that the doctrine is the result of theological interpretations rather than sound [[exegesis]] of scripture.<ref name="McGrath1"/><ref name="harris-understanding"/>

The concept was expressed in early writings from the beginning of the 2nd century forward, and other scholars hold that the way the New Testament repeatedly speaks of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit is such as to require one to accept a Trinitarian understanding.<ref name="Stagg"/>

The [[Comma Johanneum]], {{bibleref2|1John|5:7|KJV|1 John 5:7}}, is a disputed text which states: "For there are three that bear record in heaven, the Father, the Word, and the Holy Ghost: and these three are one." However, this passage is not considered to be part of the genuine text,<ref name="1john5"/> and most scholars agree that the phrase was a [[Bible gloss|gloss]].<ref name="metzger-nt"/>

=== Jesus as God ===
[[File:Meister Bertram von Minden 009.jpg|thumb|God in the person of the Son confronts [[Adam and Eve]], by [[Master Bertram]] (d. c.1415)]] 

The [[Gospel of John]] has been seen as especially aimed at emphasizing Jesus' divinity, presenting Jesus as the [[Logos (Christianity)|Logos]], pre-existent and divine, from its first words: "[[John 1:1|In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.]]"{{bibleref2c|John|1:1}}<ref name="bbc-john"/> The Gospel of John ends with Thomas's declaration that he believed Jesus was God, "My Lord and my God!"{{bibleref2c|John|20:28}}<ref name="OxfComp" /> There is no significant tendency among modern scholars to deny that John 1:1 and John 20:28 identify Jesus with God.<ref name="brown-john"/> John also portrays Jesus as the agent of creation of the universe.<ref name="fourth-gospel"/>

There are also a few possible biblical supports for the divinity of Jesus found in the [[Synoptic Gospels]]. The Gospel of Matthew, for example, quotes Jesus as saying, "All things have been handed over to me by my Father."{{bibleref2c|Mt|11:27}} This is similar to John, who wrote that Jesus said, "All that the Father has is mine."{{bibleref2c|John|16:15}} These verses have been quoted to defend the omnipotence of Christ, having all power, as well as the omniscience of Christ, having all wisdom.

Expressions also in the [[Pauline epistles]] have been interpreted as attributing divinity to Jesus. They include: "For by him all things were created: things in heaven and on earth, visible and invisible, whether thrones or powers or rulers or authorities; all things were created by him and for him"{{bibleref2c|Colossians|1:16}} and "For in Christ all the fullness of the Deity lives in bodily form",{{bibleref2c|Colossians|2:9}} and in [[Paul the Apostle]]'s claim to have been "sent not from men nor by man, but by Jesus Christ and God the Father".{{bibleref2c|Galatians|1:1}}<ref name="veritas"/>

Some have suggested that John presents a hierarchy when he quotes Jesus as saying, "The Father is greater than I",{{bibleref2c-nb|John|14:28}} a statement which was appealed to by [[Nontrinitarianism|nontrinitarian]] groups such as [[Arianism]].<ref name="simonetti"/> However, Church Fathers such as [[Augustine of Hippo]] and [[Thomas Aquinas]] argued this statement was to be understood as Jesus speaking in as to his human nature.<ref name="de-trinitate1"/><ref>{{cite book |last1=Aquinas |first1=Thomas |title=Summa Contra Gentiles Book Four Chapter 8 |url=https://dhspriory.org/thomas/ContraGentiles4.htm#8 |accessdate=11 January 2019}}</ref>

=== Holy Spirit as God ===
As the Arian controversy was dissipating, the debate moved from the deity of Jesus Christ to the equality of the Holy Spirit with the Father and Son. On one hand, the [[Pneumatomachi]] sect declared that the Holy Spirit was an inferior person to the Father and Son. On the other hand, the [[Cappadocian Fathers]] argued that the Holy Spirit was equal to the Father and Son in nature or substance.

Although the main text used in defense of the deity of the Holy Spirit was Matthew 28:19, Cappadocian Fathers such as [[Basil the Great]] argued from other verses such as "But Peter said, 'Ananias, why has Satan filled your heart to lie to the Holy Spirit and to keep back for yourself part of the proceeds of the land? While it remained unsold, did it not remain your own? And after it was sold, was it not at your disposal? Why is it that you have contrived this deed in your heart? You have not lied to men but to God.'"{{bibleref2c|Acts|5:3–4}}<ref name="basil16"/>

Another passage the Cappadocian Fathers quoted from was "By the word of the Lord the heavens were made, and by the breath of his mouth all their host."{{bibleref2c|Psalm|33:6}} According to their understanding, because "breath" and "spirit" in Hebrew are both "רוּחַ" ("ruach"), Psalm 33:6 is revealing the roles of the Son and Holy Spirit as co-creators. And since, according to them,<ref name="basil16"/> because only the holy God can create holy beings such as the angels, the Son and Holy Spirit must be God.

Yet another argument from the Cappadocian Fathers to prove that the Holy Spirit is of the same nature as the Father and Son comes from "For who knows a person's thoughts except the spirit of that person, which is in him? So also no one comprehends the thoughts of God except the Spirit of God."{{bibleref2c|1Cor.|2:11}} They reasoned that this passage proves that the Holy Spirit has the same relationship to God as the spirit within us has to us.<ref name="basil16"/>

The Cappadocian Fathers also quoted, "Do you not know that you are God's temple and that God's Spirit dwells in you?"{{bibleref2c|1Cor.|3:16}} and reasoned that it would be blasphemous for an inferior being to take up residence in a temple of God, thus proving that the Holy Spirit is equal with the Father and the Son.<ref name="basil19"/>

They also combined "the servant does not know what his master is doing"{{bibleref2c|John|15:15}} with 1 Corinthians 2:11 in an attempt to show that the Holy Spirit is not the slave of God, and therefore his equal.<ref name="basil21"/>

The Pneumatomachi contradicted the Cappadocian Fathers by quoting, "Are they not all ministering spirits sent out to serve for the sake of those who are to inherit salvation?"{{bibleref2c|Hebrews|1:14}} in effect arguing that the Holy Spirit is no different from other created angelic spirits.<ref name="CE:Pneumatomachi"/> The Church Fathers disagreed, saying that the Holy Spirit is greater than the angels, since the Holy Spirit is the one who grants the foreknowledge for prophecy{{bibleref2c|1Cor.|12:8–10}} so that the angels could announce events to come.<ref name="basil16"/>

The usage of the word "[[paraclete]]" (Greek: parakletos) for the Holy Spirit in {{bibleref|John|14:16|31}}, which can be translated as advocate, intercessor, counsellor or protector,<ref name="jerusalem"/> and the Holy Spirit's essence and action characterized by truth, as all three persons of the Trinity are linked with truth (see v. 17),<ref name="zondervan"/> are seen as arguments that he is a divine person; especially that Jesus calls him ''another'' counsellor, in this way expressing that the Holy Spirit is similar to himself in regard to our counsel.<ref name="christians.eu"/>

=== Old Testament parallels ===
[[File:Andrej Rublëv 001.jpg|thumb|left|[[Trinity (Andrei Rublev)|Russian icon of the Old Testament Trinity]] by [[Andrey Rublev]], between 1408 and 1425]]
In addition, the [[Old Testament]] has also been interpreted as foreshadowing the Trinity,<ref name="wisdom"/> by referring to God's word,{{Bibleref2c|Ps|33:6}} his spirit,{{Bibleref2c|Isa|61:1}} and Wisdom,{{Bibleref2c|Prov|9:1}} as well as narratives such as the appearance of the three men to [[Abraham]].{{Bibleref2c|Gen|18}}<ref name="ODCC"/> However, it is generally agreed among Trinitarian Christian scholars that it would go beyond the intention and spirit of the Old Testament to correlate these notions directly with later Trinitarian doctrine.<ref name="CE:Trinity"/><ref name="ERTrinity"/>

Some Church Fathers believed that a knowledge of the mystery was granted to the prophets and saints of the Old Testament, and that they identified the divine messenger of {{bibleref2|Genesis|16:7}},{{bibleref2-nb|Gen|21:17}}, {{bibleref2-nb|Gen|31:11}}, {{bibleref2|Exodus|3:2}} and Wisdom of the sapiential books with the Son, and "the spirit of the Lord" with the Holy Spirit.<ref name="CE:Trinity" /> Other Church Fathers, such as [[Gregory Nazianzen]], argued in his ''Orations'' that the revelation was gradual, claiming that the Father was proclaimed in the Old Testament openly, but the Son only obscurely, because "it was not safe, when the Godhead of the Father was not yet acknowledged, plainly to proclaim the Son".<ref name="nazianzen"/>

Genesis 18–19 has been interpreted by Christians as a Trinitarian text.<ref name="letellier"/> The narrative has the Lord appearing to Abraham, who was visited by three men.{{bibleref2c|Gen|18:1–2}} Then in {{bibleref2|Genesis|19}}, "the two angels" visited [[Lot (Bible)|Lot]] at Sodom. The interplay between Abraham on the one hand and the Lord/three men/the two angels on the other was an intriguing text for those who believed in a single God in three persons. [[Justin Martyr]], and [[John Calvin]] similarly, interpreted it such that Abraham was visited by God, who was accompanied by two angels.<ref name="Watson"/> Justin supposed that the God who visited Abraham was distinguishable from the God who remains in the heavens, but was nevertheless identified as the (monotheistic) God. Justin appropriated the God who visited Abraham to Jesus, the second person of the Trinity.

Augustine, in contrast, held that the three visitors to Abraham were the three persons of the Trinity.<ref name="Watson"/> He saw no indication that the visitors were unequal, as would be the case in Justin's reading. Then in {{bibleref2|Genesis|19}}, two of the visitors were addressed by Lot in the singular: "Lot said to them, 'Not so, my lord.'"{{bibleref2c|Gen|19:18|KJV|Gen 19:18 KJV}}<ref name="Watson"/> Augustine saw that Lot could address them as one because they had a single substance, despite the plurality of persons.<ref group=note>Augustine had poor knowledge of the Greek language, and no knowledge of Hebrew. So he trusted the LXX Septuagint, which differentiates between {{lang|grc|κύριοι}}{{bibleref2c|Gen|19:2|KJV|Gen 19:2}} ('lords', vocative plural) and{{lang|grc|κύριε}}{{bibleref2c|Gen|19:18|KJV|Gen 19:18}} ('lord', vocative singular), even if the Hebrew verbal form,{{hebrew|נא-אדני}} (''na-adoni''), is exactly the same in both cases.</ref>

According to [[Swedenborg]], the three angels which appeared to Abraham do represent the Trinity, but a Trinity of one being: the Divine Itself, the Divine Human and the Divine Proceeding. That one being is represented is indicated by the fact that they are referred to in the singular as Jehovah and Lord.<ref name="swedenborg1"/> The reason why only two of the angels went to visit Sodom and Gomorrah is that they represent the Divine Human and the Divine Proceeding, and to those aspects of the Divine belongs judgment, as Jesus declared that all judgment was entrusted by the Father to the Son.{{Bibleref2c|John|5:22}}<ref name="swedenborg2"/> The three angels did indeed appear to Abraham as three men, but they are only a symbolic representation of the Trinity, which should not be taken literally as three distinct persons. In the Old Testament, Swedenborg finds the earliest direct reference to a Trine in the Divinity in the account of Moses' encounter with the Lord in Exodus which states, "And Jehovah passed by upon his face, and called, Jehovah, Jehovah, a God merciful and gracious."{{bibleref2c|Exodus|34:6}}<ref name="swedenborg3"/>

Some Christians interpret the [[theophany|theophanies]] or appearances of the [[Angel of the Lord]] as revelations of a person distinct from God, who is nonetheless called God.<ref name="trinity-ot"/> This interpretation is found in Christianity as early as [[Justin Martyr]] and [[Melito of Sardis]], and reflects ideas that were already present in [[Philo]].<ref name="hurtado"/> The Old Testament theophanies were thus seen as [[Christophany|Christophanies]], each a "preincarnate appearance of the Messiah".<ref name="bakerdict"/>

== Impact of Stoic philosophy ==
In the introduction to his 1964 translation of ''[[Meditations]]'',<ref>{{cite book |last=Aurelius |first=Marcus |authorlink=Marcus Aurelius| title=Meditations |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WV7Teosv0bIC |year=1964 |location=London |publisher=[[Penguin Books]] |page=25 |id={{ISBN|978-0-140-44140-6}} |isbn=0-14044140-9}}</ref> the Anglican priest Maxwell Staniforth discussed the profound influence of [[Stoicism|Stoic philosophy]] on Christianity. In particular:
<blockquote>
Again in the doctrine of the Trinity, the ecclesiastical conception of Father, Word, and Spirit finds its germ in the different Stoic names of the Divine Unity. Thus [[Seneca the Younger|Seneca]], writing of the supreme Power which shapes the universe, states, 'This Power we sometimes call the All-ruling God, sometimes the incorporeal Wisdom, sometimes the [[Pneuma (Stoic)|holy Spirit]], sometimes Destiny.' The Church had only to reject the last of these terms to arrive at its own acceptable definition of the Divine Nature; while the further assertion 'these three are One', which the modern mind finds paradoxical, was no more than commonplace to those familiar with Stoic notions.</blockquote>

== Artistic depictions ==
{{Main|Trinity in art}}
The Trinity is most commonly seen in [[Christian art]] with the Spirit represented by a dove, as specified in the Gospel accounts of the [[Baptism of Jesus|Baptism of Christ]]; he is nearly always shown with wings outspread. However depictions using three human figures appear occasionally in most periods of art.<ref>See below and G Schiller, ''Iconography of Christian Art, Vol. I'', 1971, Vol II, 1972, (English trans from German), Lund Humphries, London, figs I;5–16 & passim, {{ISBN|0-85331-270-2}} and {{ISBN|0-85331-324-5}}</ref>

The Father and the Son are usually differentiated by age, and later by dress, but this too is not always the case. The usual depiction of the Father as an older man with a white beard may derive from the biblical [[Ancient of Days]], which is often cited in defense of this sometimes controversial representation. However, in [[Eastern Orthodoxy]] the Ancient of Days is usually understood to be God the Son, not God the Father (see below)—early [[Byzantine]] images show Christ as the Ancient of Days,<ref>Cartlidge, David R., and Elliott, J.K.. ''Art and the Christian Apocrypha'', pp. 69–72 (illustrating examples), Routledge, 2001, {{ISBN|0-415-23392-5}}, {{ISBN|978-0-415-23392-7}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=o0LBvOMYArYC&pg=PA240&dq=Dura+Europas+Christian&as_brr=3&ei=RZLkSebpF5KKNbePpZoN#PPA53,M1 Google books]</ref> but this [[iconography]] became rare. When the Father is depicted in art, he is sometimes shown with a [[Halo (religious iconography)|halo]] shaped like an [[equilateral triangle]], instead of a circle. The Son is often shown at the Father's right hand.{{bibleref2c|Acts|7:56}} He may be represented by a symbol—typically the Lamb (''[[agnus dei]]'') or a cross—or on a [[crucifix]], so that the Father is the only human figure shown at full size. In early medieval art, the Father may be represented by a hand appearing from a cloud in a blessing gesture, for example in scenes of the [[Baptism of Jesus|Baptism of Christ]]. Later, in the West, the Throne of Mercy (or "Throne of Grace") became a common depiction. In this style, the Father (sometimes seated on a [[throne]]) is shown supporting either a [[crucifix]]<ref>G Schiller, ''Iconography of Christian Art'', Vol. II, 1972, (English trans from German), Lund Humphries, London, figs I;5–16 & passim, {{ISBN|0-85331-270-2}} and {{ISBN|0-85331-324-5}}, pp. 122–124 and figs 409–414</ref> or, later, a slumped crucified Son, similar to the [[Pietà]] (this type is distinguished in German as the ''Not Gottes'')<ref>G Schiller, ''Iconography of Christian Art'', Vol. II, 1972, (English trans from German), Lund Humphries, London, figs I;5–16 & passim, {{ISBN|0-85331-270-2}} and {{ISBN|0-85331-324-5}}, pp. 219–224 and figs 768–804</ref> in his outstretched arms, while the Dove hovers above or in between them. This subject continued to be popular until the 18th century at least.

By the end of the 15th century, larger representations, other than the Throne of Mercy, became effectively standardised, showing an older figure in plain robes for the Father, Christ with his torso partly bare to display the wounds of his [[Passion (Christianity)|Passion]], and the dove above or around them. In earlier representations both Father, especially, and Son often wear elaborate robes and crowns. Sometimes the Father alone wears a crown, or even a [[papal tiara]].

In the later part of the [[Christian Era]], in Renaissance European iconography, the [[Eye of Providence]] began to be used as an explicit image of the Christian Trinity and associated with the concept of [[Divine Providence]].  Seventeenth-century depictions of the Eye of Providence sometimes show it surrounded by clouds or [[sunburst]]s.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rFvu92GyDQoC&lpg=PA68&pg=PA68#v=onepage&q&f=false|title=The World's Eye|first=Albert M.|last=Potts|publisher=[[University Press of Kentucky]]|pages=68–78}}</ref>

== Nontrinitarianism ==
{{Main|Nontrinitarianism}}
Nontrinitarianism (or antitrinitarianism) refers to Christian belief systems that reject the doctrine of the Trinity as found in the Nicene Creed as not having a scriptural origin. Nontrinitarian views differ widely on the nature of God, Jesus, and the Holy Spirit. Various nontrinitarian views, such as [[Adoptionism]], [[Monarchianism]], and [[Arianism]] existed prior to the formal definition of the Trinity doctrine in AD 325, 360, and 431, at the Councils of Nicaea, Constantinople, and Ephesus, respectively.<ref name="vonharnack"/> Following the final victory of orthodoxy at Constantinople in 381, [[Arianism]] was driven from the Empire, retaining a foothold amongst the Teutonic tribes. When the [[Franks]] converted to Catholicism in 496, however, it gradually faded out.<ref>Cross, F.L. (1958). ''The Oxford Dictionary of the Christian Church''. London: OUP, p. 81.</ref> Nontrinitarianism was later renewed in the [[Gnosticism]] of the [[Cathars]] in the 11th through 13th centuries, in the [[Age of Enlightenment]] of the 18th century, and in some groups arising during the [[Second Great Awakening]] of the 19th century. Also [[binitarianism]].

Arianism was condemned as [[Heresy#Christianity|heretical]] by the [[First Council of Nicaea#Arian controversy#Result of the debate|First Council of Nicaea]] and, lastly, with Sabellianism by the [[Second Ecumenical Council]] (Costantinople, 381 BCE)<ref>{{cite book | url = https://books.google.it/books?id=3QHRJNkbKJgC&pg=PA173&dq=sabellian%2Bheresy%2Bcouncil%2Bconstantinople&hl=it&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwi0w6aaiqLfAhXO3KQKHbDCADEQ6AEIPDAC#v=onepage&q=sabellian%20heresy%20council%20constantinople&f=false | title = The Story of Christian Theology: Twenty Centuries of Tradition & Reform | publisher = InterVarsity Press | year = 1999 | page = 173 | isbn = 9780830815050 | oclc = 40762786 | archive-url = https://archive.fo/PaYZ4 | archive-date =  Oct 15, 2018 | deadurl = no}}</ref>.

Griffith: ''Christians and Christianity''.</ref>

Edward Hulmes writes:
<blockquote>"The Qur'anic interpretation of trinitarian orthodoxy as belief in the Father, the Son, and the Virgin Mary, may owe less to a misunderstanding of the New Testament itself than to a recognition of the role accorded by local Christians (see [[Choloridians]]) to Mary as mother in a special sense."<ref name="oxford">Edward Hulmes: ''Qur'an and the Bible, The''; entry in the ''Oxford Companion to the Bible''.</ref></blockquote>

There is also debate about whether this verse should be taken literally.<ref name="Sirry47">{{cite book|author=Mun'im Sirry|title=Scriptural Polemics: The Qur'an and Other Religions|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Us4sAwAAQBAJ&pg=PA47#v=onepage&q&f=false|date=1 May 2014|publisher=Oxford University Press|page=47}}</ref> For example, Thomas states that verse 5:116 need not be seen as describing actually professed beliefs, but rather, giving examples of ''[[Shirk (Islam)|shirk]]'' (claiming divinity for beings other than God) and a "warning against excessive devotion to Jesus and extravagant veneration of Mary, a reminder linked to the central theme of the Quran that there is only one God and He alone is to be worshipped."<ref name="EoQ"/> When read in this light, it can be understood as an admonition, "Against the divinization of Jesus that is given elsewhere in the Quran and a warning against the virtual divinization of Mary in the declaration of the fifth-century church councils that she is [[Theotokos|'God-bearer']]."<ref name="EoQ">David Thomas, ''Trinity'', [[Encyclopedia of the Qur'an]]</ref>
