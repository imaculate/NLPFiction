The [[Harvard Corporation]] is its first chartered [[corporation]]. Although never formally affiliated with any [[Religious denomination|denomination]], the early College primarily trained [[Congregationalism in the United States|Congregational]] and [[Unitarianism|Unitarian]] clergy. Its curriculum and student body were gradually secularized during the 18th century, and by the 19th century, Harvard had emerged as the central cultural establishment among [[Boston Brahmin|Boston elites]].<ref>{{cite journal|title=Harvard and the Boston Brahmins: A Study in Institutional and Class Development, 1800–1865|last=Story|first=Ronald|journal=Journal of Social History|volume=8|issue=3 |year=1975|pages=94–121|doi=10.1353/jsh/8.3.94}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Farrell|first=Betty G.|title=Elite Families: Class and Power in Nineteenth-Century Boston|year=1993|isbn=0-7914-1593-7|publisher=State University of New York Press}}</ref> Following the [[American Civil War]], President [[Charles W. Eliot]]'s long tenure (1869–1909) transformed the college and affiliated professional schools into a modern [[research university]]; Harvard was a founding member of the [[Association of American Universities]] in 1900.<ref name="AAU">{{cite web |url=http://www.aau.edu/about/article.aspx?id=5476|title=Member Institutions and years of Admission|publisher=Association of American Universities|accessdate=August 28, 2010}}</ref>
[[A. Lawrence Lowell]], who followed Eliot, further reformed the undergraduate curriculum and undertook aggressive expansion of Harvard's land holdings and physical plant. [[James Bryant Conant]] led the university through the [[Great Depression]] and [[World War II]] and began to reform the curriculum and liberalize admissions after the war. The undergraduate college became coeducational after its 1977 merger with [[Radcliffe College]].

The university is organized into eleven<!--there seem to be 14 listed later--> separate academic units—ten faculties and the [[Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study]]—with campuses throughout the [[Greater Boston|Boston metropolitan area]]:<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.provost.harvard.edu/institutional_research/09_03OrgChtFac.pdf|title=Faculties and Allied Institutions|publisher=Office of the Provost, Harvard University|accessdate=August 27, 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100611155105/http://www.provost.harvard.edu/institutional_research/09_03OrgChtFac.pdf|archivedate=June 11, 2010}}</ref> its {{convert|209|acre|ha|adj=on}} main campus is centered on [[Harvard Yard]] in Cambridge, approximately {{convert|3|mi|0}} northwest of Boston; the [[Harvard Business School|business school]] and athletics facilities, including [[Harvard Stadium]], are located across the [[Charles River]] in the [[Allston]] neighborhood of Boston and the [[Harvard Medical School|medical]], [[Harvard School of Dental Medicine|dental]], and [[Harvard School of Public Health|public health]] schools are in the [[Longwood Medical and Academic Area|Longwood Medical Area]].<ref name="Campus">{{cite web|url=http://www.provost.harvard.edu/institutional_research/harvard_fact_book_2012_physical_plant.pdf|title=Faculties and Allied Institutions|year=2012|publisher=Office of the Provost, Harvard University|accessdate=June 15, 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130523000940/http://www.provost.harvard.edu/institutional_research/harvard_fact_book_2012_physical_plant.pdf|archivedate=May 23, 2013}}</ref> [[Harvard University endowment|Harvard's endowment]] is worth $39.2 billion, making it the [[List of colleges and universities in the United States by endowment|largest of any academic institution]].<ref name="harvard.edu">https://www.harvard.edu/sites/default/files/content/hmc_message_final_harvard_university_financial_report_2018.pdf</ref>

Harvard was established in 1636 by vote of the Great and General Court of the [[Massachusetts Bay Colony]].
In 1638, it acquired [[British North America]]'s first known printing press.<ref name="FirstPrintingPress">{{cite web|title=The instrument behind New England's first literary flowering|url=http://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2012/03/harvard's-first-impressions/|publisher=Harvard University|accessdate=January 18, 2014}}</ref><ref name="UHullMHSC">{{cite web |title=Rowley and Ezekiel Rogers, The First North American Printing Press|url=http://www.hull.ac.uk/mhsc/FarHorizons/Documents/EzekielRogers.pdf|publisher=Maritime Historical Studies Centre, University of Hull|accessdate=January 18, 2014}}</ref> In 1639, it was named ''[[Harvard College]]'' after deceased clergyman [[John Harvard (clergyman)|John Harvard]], an alumnus of the [[University of Cambridge]], who had left the school [[Pound sign|£]]779 and his scholar's library of some 400 volumes.<ref name="JH facts">{{cite web|title=John Harvard Facts, Information. |url=http://www.encyclopedia.com/topic/John_Harvard.aspx|publisher=The Columbia Encyclopedia, Sixth Edition. 2008|accessdate=July 17, 2009|quote=He bequeathed £780 (half his estate) and his library of 320 volumes to the new established college at Cambridge, Mass., which was named in his honor.}}</ref>
The charter creating the [[Harvard Corporation]] was granted in 1650.

A 1643 publication gave the school's purpose as "to advance learning and perpetuate it to posterity, dreading to leave an illiterate ministry to the churches when our present ministers shall lie in the dust";<ref>{{cite book|first=Louis B. |last=Wright|title=The Cultural Life of the American Colonies|year=2002|page=116|isbn=978-0-486-42223-7}}</ref>

It offered a classic curriculum on the English university model{{mdashb}}many leaders in the colony had attended the [[University of Cambridge]]{{mdashb}}but conformed to the tenets of [[Puritanism]]. It was never affiliated with any particular denomination, but many of its earliest graduates went on to become clergymen in Congregational and Unitarian churches.<ref>{{cite web|author=Harvard Office of News and Public Affairs |url=http://www.hno.harvard.edu/guide/intro/index.html|title=Harvard guide intro|publisher=Harvard University|date=July 26, 2007|accessdate=August 29, 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070726133429/http://www.hno.harvard.edu/guide/intro/index.html|archivedate=July 26, 2007}}</ref>

The leading Boston divine [[Increase Mather]] served as president from 1685 to 1701. In 1708, [[John Leverett the Younger|John Leverett]] became the first president who was not also a clergyman, marking a turning of the college from Puritanism and toward intellectual independence.

Throughout the 18th century, [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] ideas of the power of reason and free will became widespread among [[Congregationalism in the United States|Congregational]] ministers, putting those ministers and their congregations in tension with more traditionalist, [[Calvinist]] parties.<ref name=Dorrien>Gary J.

In 1846, the natural history lectures of [[Louis Agassiz]] were acclaimed both in New York and on the campus at Harvard College. Agassiz's approach was distinctly idealist and posited Americans' "participation in the Divine Nature" and the possibility of understanding "intellectual existences". Agassiz's perspective on science combined observation with intuition and the assumption that a person can grasp the "divine plan" in all phenomena. When it came to explaining life-forms, Agassiz resorted to matters of shape based on a presumed archetype for his evidence. This dual view of knowledge was in concert with the teachings of [[Common Sense Realism]] derived from Scottish philosophers [[Thomas Reid]] and [[Dugald Stewart]], whose works were part of the Harvard curriculum at the time. The popularity of Agassiz's efforts to "soar with Plato" probably also derived from other writings to which Harvard students were exposed, including Platonic treatises by [[Ralph Cudworth]], [[John Norris (philosopher)|John Norris]] and, in a Romantic vein, [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge]]. The library records at Harvard reveal that the writings of Plato and his early modern and Romantic followers were almost as regularly read during the 19th century as those of the "official philosophy" of the more empirical and more deistic Scottish school.<ref>{{cite journal|first=David K.|last=Nartonis|title=Louis Agassiz and the Platonist Story of Creation at Harvard, 1795–1846|journal=Journal of the History of Ideas|year=2005|volume=66|issue=3|pages=437–449|jstor=3654189|doi=10.1353/jhi.2005.0045}}</ref>

[[Charles W. Eliot]], president 1869–1909, eliminated the favored position of Christianity from the curriculum while opening it to student self-direction. While Eliot was the most crucial figure in the secularization of American higher education, he was motivated not by a desire to secularize education, but by [[Transcendentalism|Transcendentalist]] [[Unitarianism|Unitarian]] convictions. Derived from [[William Ellery Channing]] and [[Ralph Waldo Emerson]], these convictions were focused on the dignity and worth of human nature, the right and ability of each person to perceive truth, and the indwelling God in each person.<ref>{{cite journal|first=Stephen P.|last=Shoemaker|title=The Theological Roots of Charles W.

During the 20th century, Harvard's international reputation grew as a burgeoning endowment and prominent professors expanded the university's scope. Rapid enrollment growth continued as new graduate schools were begun and the undergraduate College expanded. [[Radcliffe College]], established in 1879 as sister school of Harvard College, became one of the most prominent schools for women in the United States. Harvard became a founding member of the [[Association of American Universities]] in 1900.<ref name="AAU" />

In the early 20th century, the student body was predominantly "old-stock, high-status Protestants, especially Episcopalians, Congregationalists, and Presbyterians"—a group later called "WASPs" ([[White Anglo-Saxon Protestants]]). In 1923 a proposal by president [[A. Lawrence Lowell]] that Jews be limited to 15% of undergraduates was rejected, but Lowell did ban blacks from living in Harvard Yard; Lowell believed that "forcing" blacks and whites to live together "would increase a prejudice that{{nbsp}}... is most unfortunate and probably growing." But by the 1970s, Harvard was much more diversified.<ref>{{cite book|author=Jerome Karabel|title=The Chosen: The Hidden History of Admission and Exclusion at Harvard, Yale, and Princeton|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zwf-Ofc--toC&pg=PA23|year=2006|page=23}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last1=Steinberg|first1=Stephen|title=How Jewish Quotas Began|journal=Commentary|date=September 1, 1971|url=https://www.commentarymagazine.com/articles/how-jewish-quotas-began/|accessdate=September 10, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last1=Johnson|first1=Dirk|title=YALE'S LIMIT ON JEWISH ENROLLMENT LASTED UNTIL EARLY 1960'S, BOOK SAYS|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1986/03/04/nyregion/yale-s-limit-on-jewish-enrollment-lasted-until-early-1960-s-book-says.html|publisher=The New York Times|date=March 4, 1986}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Lowell Tells Jews Limits at Colleges Might Help Them|url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1922/06/17/109843455.html|publisher=The New York Times|date=June 17, 1922}}</ref>

[[James Bryant Conant]] (president, 1933–1953) reinvigorated creative scholarship to guarantee its preeminence among research institutions. He saw higher education as a vehicle of opportunity for the talented rather than an entitlement for the wealthy, so Conant devised programs to identify, recruit, and support talented youth. In 1943, he asked the faculty make a definitive statement about what general education ought to be, at the secondary as well as the college level. The resulting ''Report'', published in 1945, was one of the most influential manifestos in the history of American education in the 20th century.<ref>Anita Fay Kravitz, "The Harvard Report of 1945: An historical ethnography", Ph.D. dissertation, University of Pennsylvania, 1994, 367 pages; AAT 9427558</ref>

In 1945–1960 admissions policies were opened up to bring in students from a more diverse applicant pool. No longer drawing mostly from rich alumni of select New England [[University-preparatory school|prep schools]], the undergraduate college was now open to striving middle class students from public schools; many more Jews and Catholics were admitted, but few blacks, Hispanics or Asians.<ref>Malka A.

during World War II, students at [[Radcliffe College]] (which since 1879 had been paying Harvard professors to repeat their lectures for women students) began attending Harvard classes alongside men,<ref>{{cite book|first=Sally|last=Schwager|chapter=Taking up the Challenge: The Origins of Radcliffe|title=Yards and Gates: Gender in Harvard and Radcliffe History|editor=Laurel Thatcher Ulrich (ed.)|location=New York|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|year=2004|isbn=1-4039-6098-4|page=115}}</ref> The first class of women was admitted to [[Harvard Medical School]] in 1945.<ref name="First class of women admitted to Harvard Medical School, 1945">{{cite report |title=First class of women admitted to Harvard Medical School, 1945 |publisher=Countway Repository, Harvard University Library |url=http://repository.countway.harvard.edu/xmlui/handle/10473/1782 |accessdate=May 2, 2016}}</ref>

Harvard's {{convert|209|acre|ha|adj=on}} main campus is centered on [[Harvard Yard]] in Cambridge, about {{convert|3|mi|km|0}} west-northwest of downtown Boston, and extends into the surrounding [[Harvard Square]] neighborhood. Harvard Yard itself contains the central administrative offices and [[Harvard University Library|main libraries of the university]], academic buildings including [[Sever Hall]] and [[University Hall (Harvard University)|University Hall]], Memorial Church, and the majority of the [[List of Harvard dormitories|freshman dormitories]]. Sophomore, junior, and senior undergraduates live in twelve [[Harvard House system|residential Houses]], nine of which are south of Harvard Yard along or near the [[Charles River]]. The other three are located in a residential neighborhood half a mile northwest of the Yard at the [[Quadrangle (Harvard)|Quadrangle]] (commonly referred to as the Quad), which formerly housed [[Radcliffe College]] students until Radcliffe merged its residential system with Harvard. Each residential house contains rooms for undergraduates, House masters, and resident tutors, as well as a dining hall and library. The facilities were made possible by a gift from [[Yale University]] alumnus [[Edward Harkness]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.exeter.edu./documents/Exeter_Bulletin/FA06_Men_Behind_the_Plan.pdf|title=History of Harkness: The Men Behind the Plan|publisher=}}</ref>

Harvard has an intense athletic rivalry with [[Yale University]] culminating in ''[[Harvard–Yale football rivalry|The Game]]'', although the [[Harvard–Yale Regatta]] predates the football game. This rivalry is put aside every two years when the Harvard and Yale [[Track and Field]] teams come together to compete against a combined [[Oxford University]] and [[Cambridge University]] team, a competition that is the oldest continuous international amateur competition in the world.<ref>{{cite web|title=Yale and Harvard Defeat Oxford/Cambridge Team|url=http://www.yalebulldogs.com/sports/w-track/recaps/041009aac.html|publisher=Yale University Athletics|accessdate=September 13, 2011}}</ref>

Harvard's athletic rivalry with [[Yale Bulldogs|Yale]] is intense in every sport in which they meet, coming to a climax each fall in the annual [[American football|football]] meeting, which dates back to 1875 and is usually called simply "[[Harvard–Yale football rivalry|The Game]]". While Harvard's football team is no longer one of the country's best as it often was a century ago during football's early days (it won the [[Rose Bowl Game|Rose Bowl]] in 1920), both it and Yale have influenced the way the game is played. In 1903, [[Harvard Stadium]] introduced a new era into football with the first-ever permanent reinforced concrete stadium of its kind in the country. The stadium's structure actually played a role in the evolution of the college game. Seeking to reduce the alarming number of deaths and serious injuries in the sport, [[Walter Camp]] (former captain of the Yale football team), suggested widening the field to open up the game. But the stadium was too narrow to accommodate a wider playing surface. So, other steps had to be taken. Camp would instead support revolutionary new rules for the 1906 season. These included legalizing the [[forward pass]], perhaps the most significant rule change in the sport's history.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.newsdial.com/sports/football/football-history.html|title=History of American Football|publisher=Newsdial.com|accessdate=August 29, 2010}}</ref><ref>Nelson, David M., ''Anatomy of a Game: Football, the Rules, and the Men Who Made the Game'', 1994, pp. 127–128</ref>

Harvard has several athletic facilities, such as the [[Lavietes Pavilion]], a multi-purpose arena and home to the Harvard basketball teams. The Malkin Athletic Center, known as the "MAC", serves both as the university's primary recreation facility and as a satellite location for several varsity sports. The five-story building includes two cardio rooms, an [[Olympic-size swimming pool]], a smaller pool for aquaerobics and other activities, a mezzanine, where all types of classes are held, an indoor cycling studio, three weight rooms, and a three-court gym floor to play basketball. The MAC offers personal trainers and specialty classes. It is home to Harvard volleyball, fencing and wrestling.

[[Weld Boathouse]] and Newell Boathouse house the women's and men's rowing teams, respectively. The men's crew also uses the Red Top complex in Ledyard, Connecticut, as their training camp for the annual [[Harvard–Yale Regatta]]. The Bright Hockey Center hosts the Harvard hockey teams, and the Murr Center serves both as a home for Harvard's squash and tennis teams as well as a strength and conditioning center for all athletic sports.

{{As of|2013}}, there were 42 Division I intercollegiate [[varsity team|varsity]] sports teams for women and men at Harvard, more than at any other [[Division I (NCAA)|NCAA Division I]] college in the country.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gocrimson.com/sports/fh/2012-13/releases/2012080853mnlh |title=Harvard : Women's Rugby Becomes 42nd Varsity Sport at Harvard University |publisher=Gocrimson.com |date=August 9, 2012 |accessdate=July 5, 2013}}</ref> As with other Ivy League universities, Harvard does not offer [[athletic scholarship]]s.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.hno.harvard.edu/guide/students/stu6.html|title=The Harvard Guide: Financial Aid at Harvard|publisher=Harvard University|date=September 2, 2006|accessdate=August 29, 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060902182731/http://www.hno.harvard.edu/guide/students/stu6.html|archivedate=September 2, 2006}}</ref>
[[File:Bright Hockey Center, Harvard.JPG|thumb|The [[Cornell–Harvard hockey rivalry]] match, 2006]]
Older than ''The Game'' by 23 years, the Harvard–Yale Regatta was the original source of the athletic rivalry between the two schools. It is held annually in June on the [[Thames River (Connecticut)|Thames River]] in eastern Connecticut. The Harvard crew is typically considered to be one of the top teams in the country in [[rowing (sport)|rowing]]. Today, Harvard fields top teams in several other sports, such as the [[Harvard Crimson men's ice hockey]] team (with a strong rivalry against [[Cornell Big Red men's ice hockey|Cornell]]), [[squash (sport)|squash]], and even recently won NCAA titles in Men's and Women's [[Fencing]]. Harvard also won the [[Intercollegiate Sailing Association National Championships]] in 2003.

Harvard's men's ice hockey team won the school's first NCAA Championship in any team sport in 1989. Harvard was also the first Ivy League institution to win a NCAA championship title in a women's sport when its women's lacrosse team won the NCAA Championship in 1990.

''[[Harvard Undergraduate Television]]'' has footage from historical games and athletic events including the 2005 pep-rally before the Harvard-Yale Game.

The school color is [[crimson]], which is also the name of the Harvard sports teams and the daily newspaper, ''[[The Harvard Crimson]]''. The color was unofficially adopted (in preference to [[magenta]]) by an 1875 vote of the student body, although the association with some form of red can be traced back to 1858, when [[Charles William Eliot]], a young graduate student who would later become Harvard's 21st and longest-serving president (1869–1909), bought red bandanas for his crew so they could more easily be distinguished by spectators at a regatta.

=== Song ===
Harvard has several fight songs, the most played of which, especially at football, are "[[Ten Thousand Men of Harvard]]" and "[[Harvardiana]]." While "[[Fair Harvard]]" is actually the [[alma mater (song)|alma mater]], "Ten Thousand Men" is better known outside the university. The [[Harvard University Band]] performs these fight songs, and other cheers at football and hockey games. These were parodied by Harvard alumnus [[Tom Lehrer]] in his song "[[Fight Fiercely, Harvard]]," which he composed while an undergraduate.

Harvard's legacy as a leading research and educational institution has a significant impact in both academy and popular culture. Furthermore, the perception of Harvard as a center of either elite achievement, or elitist privilege, has made it a frequent literary and cinematic backdrop. "In the grammar of film, Harvard has come to mean both tradition, and a certain amount of stuffiness," film critic Paul Sherman has said.<ref name="thomas">{{cite news |last=Thomas |first=Sarah |title='Social Network' taps other campuses for Harvard role |periodical=Boston.com |date=September 24, 2010 |url=http://www.boston.com/yourtown/news/cambridge/2010/09/harvard_at_the_movies_schools.html |quote='In the grammar of film, Harvard has come to mean both tradition, and a certain amount of stuffiness....

=== Film ===

Harvard's policy since 1970 has been to permit filming on its property only rarely, so most scenes set at Harvard (especially indoor shots, but excepting aerial footage and shots of public areas such as Harvard Square) are in fact shot elsewhere.<ref>{{cite news|first=Nathaniel L. |last=Schwartz |url=http://www.thecrimson.harvard.edu/article/1999/9/21/university-hollywood-relationship-not-always-a/ |title=University, Hollywood Relationship Not Always a 'Love Story' |publisher=Harvard Crimson |date=September 21, 1999 |accessdate=September 15, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.boston.com/yourtown/news/cambridge/2010/09/harvard_at_the_movies_schools.html|title='Social Network' taps other campuses for Harvard role| author=Sarah Thomas|date=  September 24, 2010 |website=boston.com}}</ref>
