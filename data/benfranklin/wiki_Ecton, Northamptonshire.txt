'''Ecton''' is a village and [[Civil parishes in England|civil parish]] in the [[Wellingborough (borough)|Borough of Wellingborough]] in [[Northamptonshire]], England. The village is just east of [[Northampton]], just off the [[A4500 road]]. It was one of the first villages in Northamptonshire to be given conservation status.{{citation needed|date= February 2010}}{{Clarify|date= February 2010}}  The [[Toponymy|toponym]] is derived from the [[Old English]] words ''Ecca'' and ''tun'', meaning "Ecca's farm/settlement."

The World's End is at the edge of the village on the A4500 and is known as the world’s end as there is a field behind the pub in which there was a battle where the kings son joined the opposite team and fought against him, the reason it is called the world end is because people thought the world was going to end when the battle took place.

==Demographics==
The [[United Kingdom Census 2011|2011 Census]] recorded 466 people living in the village: 231 male, 235 female, in 211 households.<ref>[http://neighbourhood.statistics.gov.uk/dissemination/LeadKeyFigures.do?a=7&b=11123083&c=ecton&d=16&e=62&g=6452708&i=1001x1003x1032x1004&o=1&m=0&r=1&s=1437005948311&enc=1 Office of National Statistics: Ecton CP: Parish headcounts] Retrieved 16 July 2015.</ref>

==American links==
Ecton is a place of [[pilgrimage]] for many [[United States|Americans]]. [[Benjamin Franklin]]'s ancestors lived here for over 300 years, many generations of them being the village blacksmiths, on a site where now stands the Three Horseshoes Inn. There are still headstones for members of the Franklin family in the village churchyard; inside the church there is a bronze plaque, provided by a group of American visitors in 1910, which has a quotation from one of Benjamin Franklin’s speeches.<ref>Benge & Benge, 2005, page not cited</ref>

==Transport==
Ecton is served by the A4500 which runs east-west past the top of the village. The road connects Ecton to [[Northampton]] and [[Wellingborough]], as well as a number of other villages. To the south of the village is the A45. There are no public transport services that run through the village itself, although [[Stagecoach Group|Stagecoach United Counties]] provide regular bus services that stop on the A4500. Bus services run from early morning to late evening with a reduced service on Sundays and Bank Holidays.<ref>Source: Bus timetable for X4/X46, http://www.stagecoachbus.com/uploads/NNX46Sept2007cropped.pdf{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>

[[File:The shrine ecton.jpg|thumb|left|The Shrine]]
The [[Church of England parish church]] of Saint [[Mary Magdalene]] is just off the High Street. It dates from the 13th century.<ref>Pevsner & Cherry, 1973, page 206</ref> Graves of the Sotheby family of Ecton Hall and the Franklin family are in the churchyard. The church is in the [[Anglican Diocese of Peterborough|Diocese of Peterborough]].

Two former chapels, one off the High Street and the other in West Street, have been converted to residential properties.

From about 1687 to 1703 Henry Bagley ran a [[Bellfounding|bell foundry]] in Ecton.<ref name=Salzman>Salzman, 1937, pages 122-127</ref> Bagley is buried in the parish churchyard.<ref name=Salzman/> The Bagley family also ran a bell-foundry in [[Chacombe#Social and economic history|Chacombe]].<ref>[http://www.chacombeparish.co.uk/church_chapel/bagley.html Chacombe: Church Guide: Bagley bell-founders] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120301165418/http://www.chacombeparish.co.uk/church_chapel/bagley.html |date=1 March 2012 }}</ref>

==Public houses==
Ecton has two [[public house]]s: The World's End which was refurbished and extended in 2006, and The Three Horseshoes, also recently refurbished in April 2011.
