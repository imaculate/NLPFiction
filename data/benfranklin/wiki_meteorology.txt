{{Atmospheric sciences}}

'''Meteorology''' is a branch of the [[atmospheric sciences]] which includes [[atmospheric chemistry]] and [[atmospheric physics]], with a major focus on [[weather forecasting]].  The study of meteorology dates back [[millennia]], though significant progress in meteorology did not occur until the 18th century. The 19th century saw modest progress in the field after [[weather observation]] networks were formed across broad regions. Prior attempts at [[Weather prediction|prediction of weather]] depended on historical data. It was not until after the elucidation of the [[laws of physics]] and more particularly, the development of the computer, allowing for the automated solution of a great many equations that model the weather, in the latter half of the 20th century that significant breakthroughs in weather forecasting were achieved.

[[List of meteorological phenomena|Meteorological phenomena]] are observable weather events that are explained by the science of meteorology. Meteorological phenomena are described and quantified by the variables of [[Earth's atmosphere]]: [[temperature]], [[air pressure]], [[water vapour]], [[mass flow]], and the variations and interactions of those variables, and how they change over time. Different [[Scale (spatial)|spatial scales]] are used  to describe and predict weather on local, regional, and global levels.
 
Meteorology, [[climatology]], [[atmospheric physics]], and [[atmospheric chemistry]] are sub-disciplines of the [[atmospheric sciences]]. Meteorology and [[hydrology]] compose the interdisciplinary field of [[hydrometeorology]]. The interactions between Earth's atmosphere and its oceans are part of a coupled ocean-atmosphere system. Meteorology has application in many diverse fields such as the military, [[energy production]], transport, [[agriculture]], and [[construction]].

The word ''[[wikt:meteorology|meteorology]]'' is from the [[Ancient Greek]] [[wikt:μετέωρος|μετέωρος]] ''metéōros'' (''meteor'') and [[wikt:-λογία|-λογία]] ''-logia'' (''[[wikt:-logy|-(o)logy]]''), meaning "the study of things high in the air".

The ability to predict rains and floods based on annual cycles was evidently used by humans at least from the time of agricultural settlement if not earlier. Early approaches to predicting weather were based on [[astrology]] and were practiced by priests. [[Cuneiform]] inscriptions on [[Babylon]]ian tablets included associations between thunder and rain. The [[Babylon|Chaldean]]s differentiated the [[22° halo|22°]] and [[46° halo]]s.<ref name=":0">{{Cite journal|last=Hellmann|first=G.|date=1908-10-01|title=The dawn of meteorology|journal=Quarterly Journal of the Royal Meteorological Society|language=en|volume=34|issue=148|pages=221–232|doi=10.1002/qj.49703414802|issn=1477-870X|bibcode=1908QJRMS..34..221H}}</ref>

In the late 16th century and first half of the 17th century a range of meteorological instruments was invented – the [[thermometer]], [[barometer]], [[hydrometer]], as well as wind and rain gauges. In the 1650s natural philosophers started using these instruments to systematically record weather observations. Scientific academies established weather diaries and organised observational networks.<ref name="ModScience">{{Cite book|title = The Oxford Companion to the History of Modern Science|publisher=Oxford University Press|date=2003|author=John L. Heilbron|isbn=9780199743766|pages=518}}</ref> In 1654, [[Ferdinando II de Medici]] established the first ''weather observing'' network, that consisted of meteorological stations in [[Florence]], [[Cutigliano]], [[Vallombrosa]], [[Bologna]], [[Parma]], [[Milan]], [[Innsbruck]], [[Osnabrück]], Paris and [[Warsaw]]. The collected data were sent to Florence at regular time intervals.<ref>Raymond S. Bradley, Philip D. Jones, ''Climate Since A.D. 1500'', Routledge, 1992, {{ISBN|0-415-07593-9}}, p.144</ref> In the 1660s [[Robert Hooke]] of the [[Royal Society of London]] sponsored networks of weather observers. [[Hippocrates]]' treatise ''Airs, Waters, and Places'' had linked weather to disease. Thus early meteorologists attempted to correlate weather patterns with epidemic outbreaks, and the climate with public health.<ref name="ModScience" />

During the [[Age of Enlightenment]] meteorology tried to rationalise traditional weather lore, including astrological meteorology. But there were also attempts to establish a theoretical understanding of weather phenomena. [[Edmond Halley]] and [[George Hadley]] tried to explain [[trade winds]]. They reasoned that the rising mass of heated equator air is replaced by an inflow of cooler air from high latitudes. A flow of warm air at high altitude from equator to poles in turn established an early picture of circulation. Frustration with the lack of discipline among weather observers, and the poor quality of the instruments, led the early modern [[nation states]] to organise large observation networks. Thus by the end of the 18th century meteorologists had access to large quantities of reliable weather date.<ref name="ModScience" /> In 1832, an electromagnetic telegraph was created by [[Baron Schilling]].<ref>Rebecca Martin (2009) [http://www.abc.net.au/cgi-bin/common/printfriendly.pl?/catapult/indepth/telegraph.htm Catapult - Indepth - Communication: telegraph] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303171042/http://www.abc.net.au/cgi-bin/common/printfriendly.pl?%2Fcatapult%2Findepth%2Ftelegraph.htm |date=2016-03-03 }}, [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]], Retrieved on 2009-05-12</ref> The arrival of the [[electrical telegraph]] in 1837 afforded, for the first time, a practical method for quickly gathering [[surface weather observation]]s from a wide area.<ref>[[Library of Congress]], [http://memory.loc.gov/ammem/sfbmhtml/sfbmtelessay.html The Invention of the Telegraph], Retrieved on 2009-01-01</ref>

This data could be used to produce maps of the state of the atmosphere for a region near the Earth's surface and to study how these states evolved through time.

The first daily weather forecasts made by FitzRoy's Office were published in ''[[The Times]]'' newspaper in 1860.

[[File:IBM 7090 console used by a meteorologist, 1965.jpg|thumb|A meteorologist at the console of the IBM 7090 in the Joint Numerical Weather Prediction Unit. c. 1965]]

In 1904, Norwegian scientist [[Vilhelm Bjerknes]] first argued in his paper ''Weather Forecasting as a Problem in Mechanics and Physics'' that it should be possible to forecast weather from calculations based upon [[physical law|natural laws]].<ref>Berknes, V. (1904) "Das Problem der Wettervorhersage, betrachtet vom Standpunkte der Mechanik und der Physik" (The problem of weather prediction, considered from the viewpoints of mechanics and physics), ''Meteorologische Zeitschrift'', '''21''' : 1–7.

It was not until later in the 20th century that advances in the understanding of atmospheric physics led to the foundation of modern [[numerical weather prediction]]. In 1922, [[Lewis Fry Richardson]] published "Weather Prediction By Numerical Process",<ref>Richardson, Lewis Fry, ''Weather Prediction by Numerical Process'' (Cambridge, England:  Cambridge University Press, 1922).  Available on-line at:  [https://archive.org/stream/weatherpredictio00richrich#page/n7/mode/2up Internet Archive.org].</ref> after finding notes and derivations he worked on as an ambulance driver in World War I. He described how small terms in the prognostic fluid dynamics equations that govern atmospheric flow could be neglected, and a numerical calculation scheme that could be devised to allow predictions. Richardson envisioned a large auditorium of thousands of people performing the calculations. However, the sheer number of calculations required was too large to complete without electronic computers, and the size of the grid and time steps used in the calculations led to unrealistic results. Though numerical analysis later found that this was due to [[numerical instability]].

Starting in the 1950s, [[number|numerical]] forecasts with computers became feasible.<ref>American Institute of Physics. [http://www.aip.org/history/sloan/gcm/ Atmospheric General Circulation Modeling.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080325084036/http://www.aip.org/history/sloan/gcm/ |date=2008-03-25 }} Retrieved on 2008-01-13.</ref> The first [[weather forecast]]s derived this way used [[barotropic]] (single-vertical-level) models, and could successfully predict the large-scale movement of midlatitude [[Rossby wave]]s, that is, the pattern of [[low pressure area|atmospheric lows]] and [[high pressure area|highs]].<ref>{{cite book |title=Storm Watchers |page=208 |year=2002 |author=Cox, John D. |publisher=John Wiley & Sons, Inc. |isbn=978-0-471-38108-2}}</ref> In 1959, the UK Meteorological Office received its first computer, a [[Ferranti Mercury]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/research/modelling-systems/history-of-numerical-weather-prediction|title=The history of Numerical Weather Prediction at the Met Office|last=|first=|date=|website=Met Office|access-date=}}</ref>

In the 1960s, the [[Chaos theory|chaotic]] nature of the atmosphere was first observed and mathematically described by [[Edward Lorenz]], founding the field of [[chaos theory]].<ref>Edward N. Lorenz, "Deterministic non-periodic flow", ''Journal of the Atmospheric Sciences'', vol.&nbsp;20, pages 130–141 (1963).</ref> These advances have led to the current use of [[ensemble forecasting]] in most major forecasting centers, to take into account uncertainty arising from the chaotic nature of the atmosphere.<ref name="HPCens">{{cite web |url=http://www.wpc.ncep.noaa.gov/ensembletraining |author=Manousos, Peter |publisher=[[Hydrometeorological Prediction Center]] |date=2006-07-19 |accessdate=2010-12-31 |title=Ensemble Prediction Systems}}</ref> Mathematical models used to predict the long term weather of the Earth ([[climate model]]s), have been developed that have a resolution today that are as coarse as the older weather prediction models.

==Meteorologists==
{{further|Weather forecasting}}

'''Meteorologists''' are scientists who study meteorology.<ref>{{cite book|first1=Todd S.|last1=Glickman|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts|date=June 2009|url=http://glossary.ametsoc.org/wiki/Meteorologist |title=Meteorology Glossary|format=electronic|edition=2nd|publisher=[[American Meteorological Society]]|accessdate=March 10, 2014}}</ref> The American Meteorological Society published and continually updates an authoritative electronic ''Meteorology Glossary''.<ref>{{cite book|first1=Todd S.|last1=Glickman|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts|date=June 2000|url=http://glossary.ametsoc.org/?p=1&query=doldrums|title=Meteorology Glossary|format=electronic|edition=2nd|publisher=[[American Meteorological Society]]|accessdate=March 10, 2014}}</ref> Meteorologists work in [[Government agency|government agencies]], private consulting and [[research]] services, industrial enterprises, utilities, radio and [[television stations]], and in [[education]]. In the United States, meteorologists held about 9,400 jobs in 2009.<ref name="BLS">[http://www.bls.gov/oco/ocos051.htm Bureau of labor statistics: "Occupational Outlook Handbook, 2010–11 Edition"]</ref>

Meteorologists are best known by the public for [[weather forecasting]]. Some radio and television weather forecasters are professional meteorologists, while others are [[reporters]] (weather specialist, weatherman, etc.) with no formal meteorological training. The [[American Meteorological Society]] and [[National Weather Association]] issue "Seals of Approval" to weather broadcasters who meet certain requirements.

==Equipment==
[[File:Huracán Hugo.jpg|thumb|Satellite image of [[Hurricane Hugo]] with a [[polar low]] visible at the top of the image]]
{{Main|Meteorological instrumentation}}
Each science has its own unique sets of laboratory equipment. In the atmosphere, there are many things or qualities of the atmosphere that can be measured. Rain, which can be observed, or seen anywhere and anytime was one of the first atmospheric qualities measured historically. Also, two other accurately measured qualities are wind and humidity. Neither of these can be seen but can be felt. The devices to measure these three sprang up in the mid-15th century and were respectively the [[rain gauge]], the anemometer, and the hygrometer. Many attempts had been made prior to the 15th century to construct adequate equipment to measure the many atmospheric variables. Many were faulty in some way or were simply not reliable. Even [[Aristotle]] noted this in some of his work as the difficulty to measure the air.

Sets of surface measurements are important data to meteorologists. They give a snapshot of a variety of weather conditions at one single location and are usually at a [[weather station]], a ship or a [[weather buoy]]. The measurements taken at a weather station can include any number of atmospheric observables. Usually, temperature, [[atmospheric pressure|pressure]], wind measurements, and [[humidity]] are the variables that are measured by a thermometer, barometer, anemometer, and hygrometer, respectively.<ref>Office of the Federal Coordinator of Meteorology. [http://www.ofcm.gov/fmh-1/fmh1.htm Federal Meteorological Handbook No. 1 - Surface Weather Observations and Reports: September 2005.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/19990420051036/http://www.ofcm.gov/fmh-1/fmh1.htm |date=1999-04-20 }} Retrieved on 2009-01-02.</ref> Professional stations may also include air quality sensors ([[carbon monoxide]], [[carbon dioxide]], [[methane]], [[ozone]], [[dust]], and [[smoke]]), [[ceilometer]] (cloud ceiling), falling precipitation sensor,  [[level sensor|flood sensor]], [[lightning|lightning sensor]], [[microphone]] ([[explosion]]s, [[sonic boom]]s, [[thunder]]), [[pyranometer]]/[[pyrheliometer]]/[[spectroradiometer]] (IR/Vis/UV [[photodiodes]]), [[rain gauge]]/[[snow gauge]], [[scintillation counter]] ([[background radiation]], [[fallout]], [[radon]]), [[seismometer]] ([[earthquake]]s and tremors), [[transmissometer]] (visibility), and a [[GPS clock]] for [[data logging]]. Upper air data are of crucial importance for weather forecasting. The most widely used technique is launches of [[radiosonde]]s. Supplementing the radiosondes a [[Aircraft Meteorological Data Relay|network of aircraft collection]] is organized by the [[World Meteorological Organization]].

[[Remote sensing]], as used in meteorology, is the concept of collecting data from remote weather events and subsequently producing weather information. The common types of remote sensing are [[Radar]], [[Lidar]], and [[satellites]] (or [[photogrammetry]]). Each collects data about the atmosphere from a remote location and, usually, stores the data where the instrument is located. Radar and Lidar are not passive because both use [[EM radiation]] to illuminate a specific portion of the atmosphere.<ref>Peebles, Peyton, [1998], ''Radar Principles'', John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York, {{ISBN|0-471-25205-0}}.</ref>  Weather satellites along with more general-purpose Earth-observing satellites circling the earth at various altitudes have become an indispensable tool for studying a wide range of phenomena from forest fires to [[El Niño]].

==Spatial scales==
The study of the atmosphere can be divided into distinct areas that depend on both time and spatial scales. At one extreme of this scale is climatology. In the timescales of hours to days, meteorology separates into micro-, meso-, and synoptic scale meteorology. Respectively, the [[geospatial]] size of each of these three scales relates directly with the appropriate timescale.

Other subclassifications are used to describe the unique, local, or broad effects within those subclasses.

===Microscale===
{{Main|Microscale meteorology}}

Microscale meteorology is the study of atmospheric phenomena on a scale of about {{convert|1|km|mi}} or less. Individual thunderstorms, clouds, and local turbulence caused by buildings and other obstacles (such as individual hills) are modeled on this scale.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://amsglossary.allenpress.com/glossary/search?query=micrometeorology |title=AMS Glossary of Meteorology |accessdate=2008-04-12 |publisher=[[American Meteorological Society]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110606101802/http://amsglossary.allenpress.com/glossary/search?query=micrometeorology |archivedate=2011-06-06 |df= }}</ref>

===Mesoscale===
{{Main|Mesoscale meteorology}}

Mesoscale meteorology is the study of atmospheric phenomena that has horizontal scales ranging from 1&nbsp;km to 1000&nbsp;km and a vertical scale that starts at the Earth's surface and includes the atmospheric boundary layer, troposphere, [[tropopause]], and the lower section of the [[stratosphere]]. Mesoscale timescales last from less than a day to weeks. The events typically of interest are [[thunderstorm]]s, [[squall line]]s, [[weather front|fronts]], [[rainbands|precipitation bands]] in [[tropical cyclone|tropical]] and [[extratropical cyclone]]s, and topographically generated weather systems such as mountain waves and [[sea breeze|sea and land breezes]].<ref>''[http://amsglossary.allenpress.com/glossary Online Glossary of Meteorology]'', [[American Meteorological Society]] [http://www.ametsoc.org/], 2nd Ed., 2000, [http://www.allenpress.com Allen Press].</ref>

===Synoptic scale===
[[File:Surface analysis.gif|thumb|upright=1.35|[[NOAA]]: Synoptic scale weather analysis.]]
{{Main|Synoptic scale meteorology}}

Synoptic scale meteorology predicts atmospheric changes at scales up to 1000&nbsp;km and 10<sup>5</sup> sec (28 days), in time and space. At the synoptic scale, the [[Coriolis acceleration]] acting on moving air masses (outside of the tropics) plays a dominant role in predictions. The phenomena typically described by [[synoptic meteorology]] include events such as extratropical cyclones, baroclinic troughs and ridges, [[weather front|frontal zones]], and to some extent [[jet stream]]s. All of these are typically given on [[weather map]]s for a specific time. The minimum horizontal scale of synoptic phenomena is limited to the spacing between [[weather station|surface observation stations]].<ref>Bluestein, H., ''<u>Synoptic-Dynamic Meteorology in Midlatitudes: Principles of Kinematics and Dynamics, Vol. 1</u>'', Oxford University Press, 1992; {{ISBN|0-19-506267-1}}</ref>

===Global scale===
[[File:WOA09 sea-surf TMP AYool.png|thumb|upright=1.35|Annual mean sea surface temperatures.]]

Global scale meteorology is the study of weather patterns related to the transport of heat from the [[tropics]] to the [[Geographical pole|poles]]. Very large scale oscillations are of importance at this scale. These oscillations have time periods typically on the order of months, such as the [[Madden–Julian oscillation]], or years, such as the [[El Niño–Southern Oscillation]] and the [[Pacific decadal oscillation]]. Global scale meteorology pushes into the range of climatology. The traditional definition of climate is pushed into larger timescales and with the understanding of the longer time scale global oscillations, their effect on climate and weather disturbances can be included in the synoptic and mesoscale timescales predictions.

Numerical Weather Prediction is a main focus in understanding air–sea interaction, tropical meteorology, atmospheric predictability, and tropospheric/stratospheric processes.<ref>[http://www.nrlmry.navy.mil/sec7532.htm Global Modelling], US Naval Research Laboratory, Monterey, Ca.</ref> The [[Naval Research Laboratory]] in Monterey, California, developed a global atmospheric model called [[Navy Operational Global Atmospheric Prediction System]] (NOGAPS). NOGAPS is run operationally at [[Fleet Numerical Meteorology and Oceanography Center]] for the United States Military. Many other global atmospheric models are run by national meteorological agencies.

==Some meteorological principles==

===Boundary layer meteorology===
[[Boundary layer]] meteorology is the study of processes in the air layer directly above Earth's surface, known as the [[Planetary boundary layer|atmospheric boundary layer]] (ABL). The effects of the surface&nbsp;– heating, cooling, and [[friction]]&nbsp;– cause [[turbulence|turbulent mixing]] within the air layer. Significant movement  of [[sensible heat|heat]], [[matter]], or [[momentum]] on time scales of less than a day are caused by turbulent motions.<ref>''Garratt, J.R., ''<u>The atmospheric boundary layer</u>'', Cambridge University Press, 1992; {{ISBN|0-521-38052-9}}.</ref> Boundary layer meteorology includes the study of all types of surface–atmosphere boundary, including ocean, lake, urban land and non-urban land for the study of meteorology.

===Dynamic meteorology===
Dynamic meteorology generally focuses on the [[fluid dynamics]] of the atmosphere. The idea of [[air parcel]] is used to define the smallest element of the atmosphere, while ignoring the discrete molecular and chemical nature of the atmosphere. An air parcel is defined as a point in the fluid continuum of the atmosphere. The fundamental laws of fluid dynamics, thermodynamics, and motion are used to study the atmosphere. The physical quantities that characterize the state of the atmosphere are temperature, density, pressure, etc. These variables have unique values in the continuum.<ref>Holton, J.R. [2004].

===Aviation meteorology===
Aviation meteorology deals with the impact of weather on [[air traffic control|air traffic management]]. It is important for air crews to understand the implications of weather on their flight plan as well as their aircraft, as noted by the [[Aeronautical Information Manual]]:<ref>An international version called the [[Aeronautical Information Publication]] contains parallel information, as well as specific information on the international airports for use by the international community.</ref>
<blockquote>''The effects of ice on aircraft are cumulative—thrust is reduced, drag increases, lift lessens, and weight increases. The results are an increase in stall speed and a deterioration of aircraft performance. In extreme cases, 2 to 3 inches of ice can form on the leading edge of the airfoil in less than 5 minutes. It takes but 1/2 inch of ice to reduce the lifting power of some aircraft by 50 percent and increases the frictional drag by an equal percentage.''<ref>''"7-1-22. PIREPs Relating to Airframe Icing"'', [February 16, 2006], [[Aeronautical Information Manual]], [http://www.faa.gov/air_traffic/publications/ATpubs/AIM/ FAA AIM Online] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090712031134/http://www.faa.gov/air_traffic/publications/ATpubs/AIM/ |date=2009-07-12 }}</ref></blockquote>

===Agricultural meteorology===
Meteorologists, [[soil science|soil scientists]], agricultural hydrologists, and [[agronomy|agronomists]] are people concerned with studying the effects of weather and climate on plant distribution, [[crop yield]], water-use efficiency, [[phenology]] of plant and animal development, and the energy balance of managed and natural ecosystems. Conversely, they are interested in the role of vegetation on climate and weather.<ref>[http://www.elsevier.com/wps/find/journaldescription.cws_home/503295/description?navopenmenu=-2 Agricultural and Forest Meteorology], Elsevier, {{ISSN|0168-1923}}.</ref>

===Hydrometeorology===
[[Hydrometeorology]] is the branch of meteorology that deals with the [[hydrologic cycle]], the water budget, and the rainfall statistics of [[storm]]s.<ref>[http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9041744/hydrometeorology Encyclopædia Britannica], 2007.</ref> A hydrometeorologist prepares and issues forecasts of accumulating (quantitative) precipitation, heavy rain, heavy snow, and highlights areas with the potential for flash flooding. Typically the range of knowledge that is required overlaps with climatology, mesoscale and synoptic meteorology, and other geosciences.<ref>[http://www.wpc.ncep.noaa.gov/html/about2.shtml About the HPC], NOAA/ National Weather Service, National Centers for Environmental Prediction, [http://www.wpc.ncep.noaa.gov/ Hydrometeorological Prediction Center], Camp Springs, Maryland, 2007.</ref>

The multidisciplinary nature of the branch can result in technical challenges, since tools and solutions from each of the individual disciplines involved may behave slightly differently, be optimized for different hard- and software platforms and use different data formats. There are some initiatives – such as the DRIHM project<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.drihm.eu/|title=Home|author=Super User|publisher=|accessdate=16 June 2015}}</ref> – that are trying to address this issue.<ref>[http://www.drihm.eu/images/newsletter/newsletter%20drihm%2001.pdf DRIHM News, number 1, March 2012, p2] "An ideal environment for hydro-meteorology research at the European level"</ref>

===Maritime meteorology===
Maritime meteorology deals with air and wave forecasts for ships operating at sea. Organizations such as the [[Ocean Prediction Center]], Honolulu [[National Weather Service]] forecast office, United Kingdom [[Met Office]], and [[Japan Meteorological Agency|JMA]] prepare high seas forecasts for the world's oceans.

===Military meteorology===
{{Main|Military meteorology}}

Military meteorology is the research and application of meteorology for [[military]] purposes. In the United States, the [[United States Navy]]'s [[Commander, Naval Meteorology and Oceanography Command]] oversees meteorological efforts for the Navy and [[United States Marine Corps|Marine Corps]] while the [[United States Air Force]]'s [[Air Force Weather Agency]] is responsible for the Air Force and [[United States Army|Army]].

===Environmental meteorology===
Environmental meteorology mainly analyzes industrial pollution dispersion physically and chemically based on meteorological parameters such as temperature, humidity, wind, and various weather conditions.

===Renewable energy===
Meteorology applications in renewable energy includes basic research, "exploration", and potential mapping of wind power and solar radiation for wind and solar energy.
