'''Bethlehem''' is a city in [[Lehigh County, Pennsylvania|Lehigh]] and [[Northampton County, Pennsylvania|Northampton]] counties in the [[Lehigh Valley]] region of the eastern portion of the [[U.S. state]] of [[Pennsylvania]]. The city is named after the Palestinian city Bethlehem that is located in the West Bank. As of the 2010 census, the city had a total population of 74,982, making it the seventh largest city in Pennsylvania, after [[Philadelphia]], [[Pittsburgh]], [[Allentown, Pennsylvania|Allentown]], [[Erie, Pennsylvania|Erie]], [[Reading, Pennsylvania|Reading]], and [[Scranton, Pennsylvania|Scranton]].<ref>[http://2010.census.gov/news/releases/operations/cb11-cn74.html.csv U.S. Census Bureau, 2010. Retrieved 25 March 2011.]{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> Of this, 55,639 were in Northampton County, and 19,343 were in Lehigh County.

Bethlehem lies in the center of the Lehigh Valley, a region of <span style="white-space:nowrap">{{convert|731|sqmi|abbr=on}}</span> that is home to more than 800,000 people.  Together with Allentown and [[Easton, Pennsylvania|Easton]], the Valley embraces the '''Allentown-Bethlehem-Easton, PA-NJ metropolitan area''', including Lehigh, Northampton, and [[Carbon County, Pennsylvania|Carbon]] counties within Pennsylvania, and [[Warren County, New Jersey|Warren County]] in the adjacent state of [[New Jersey]]. Smaller than Allentown but larger than Easton, Bethlehem is the Lehigh Valley's second most populous city. In turn, this [[metropolitan area]] comprises Pennsylvania's third-largest metropolitan area and the state's largest and most populous contribution to the greater [[New York metropolitan area|New York City metropolitan area]].

There are four general sections of the city: central Bethlehem, the south side, the east side, and the west side. Each of these sections blossomed at different times in the city's development and each contains areas recognized under the [[National Register of Historic Places]]. ZIP codes that use the address Bethlehem totaled 116,000 in population in the year 2000. These ZIP codes include [[Bethlehem Township, Northampton County, Pennsylvania|Bethlehem Township]] and [[Hanover Township, Northampton County, Pennsylvania|Hanover Township]].

The [[Norfolk Southern Railway]]'s [[Lehigh Line (Norfolk Southern)|Lehigh Line]] (formerly the main line of the [[Lehigh Valley Railroad]]), runs through Bethlehem heading east to [[Easton, Pennsylvania]] and [[Phillipsburg, New Jersey]] across the Delaware River. The Norfolk Southern Railway's [[Reading Line]] runs through Bethlehem heading west to Allentown and Reading.

In July 2006, ''[[Money (magazine)|Money]]'' magazine placed Bethlehem as number 88 on its "Top 100 Best Places to Live."<ref>{{cite news| url=http://money.cnn.com/magazines/moneymag/bplive/2006/top100/index4.html | work=CNN | title=MONEY Magazine: Best places to live 2006: Top 100 76–100}}</ref>

== History ==
[[File:Colonial Industrial Quarter-Bethlehem, Pa..jpg|thumb|left|The Colonial Industrial Quarter on the east bank of Monocacy Creek in Bethlehem.]]
The areas along the Delaware River and its tributaries in eastern Pennsylvania were long inhabited by [[indigenous peoples]] of various cultures.  By the time of European contact, these areas were the historic territory of the [[Algonquian languages|Algonquian]]-speaking [[Lenape Nation]], which had three main divisions, the [[Unami people|Unami]], [[Unalachtigo Lenape|Unalachtigo]], and [[Munsee people|Munsee]].  They traded with the Dutch and then English colonists in the mid-Atlantic area.

On Christmas Eve in 1741, [[David Nitschmann der Bischof|David Nitschmann]] and Count Nicolaus von [[Zinzendorf]], leading a small group of [[Moravian Church|Moravians]], founded the [[Mission (Christian)|mission]] community of Bethlehem along the banks of the [[Monocacy Creek (Lehigh River)|Monocacy Creek]] by the [[Lehigh River]] in the colony of [[Pennsylvania]]. They came to set up missionary communities among the Native Americans and unchurched German-speaking Christians. They named the settlement after the Biblical town [[Bethlehem]] of [[Judea (Roman province)|Judea]], the birthplace of Jesus. "Count Zinzendorf said, 'Brothers, how more fittingly could we call our new home than to name it in honor of the spot where the event we now commemorate took place. We will call this place Bethlehem.' And so was Bethlehem named after the birthplace of the Man of Peace.'" (from a letter by Gordon Dent to Mr. T. Donald Bain March 3, 1965 quoting from "Story of Bethlehem Steel" by Arundel Cotter, more details are given in this article) Originally it was a typical Moravian Settlement Congregation, where the Church owned all the property.  Until the 1850s, supposedly only members of the Moravian Church were permitted to lease land plots in Bethlehem. However, a member of a group of families that were part of a [[Huguenot]] settlement in the [[Delaware River Valley]] also landed in Bethlehem, and a decade or two before 1800 had established grist and saw mills known as Calvin's Mills. One member of this family was part of the Bethlehem Township council from 1798 to 1802.<ref name="Calvin">{{cite book|last=Calvin|first=Claude|title=The Calvin Families|publisher=University of Wisconsin|date=1945|url=https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=wu.89062866439;view=1up;seq=1|p=59}}</ref> The historic Brethren's House, Sisters' House, Widows' House and ''[[Gemeinhaus-Lewis David De Schweinitz Residence|Gemeinhaus]]'' (Congregation House) with the Old Chapel are remnants of this period of communal living.<ref>{{cite web|title=Exploring the Religious History of the Lehigh Valley at the Moravian Historical Society Museum|url=https://uncoveringpa.com/moravian-historical-society-museum|website=Uncovering PA|accessdate=25 December 2017}}</ref>

The Moravians ministered to regional Lenape [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native Americans]] through their mission in the area, as well as further east in the New York colony.  In the historic Bethlehem [[God's Acre]] cemetery, converted Lenape lie buried alongside the Moravians.

In 1762, Bethlehem built the first water-works in America to pump water for public use. While [[George Washington]] and his troops stayed in [[Valley Forge]], Washington stored his personal effects at the farm of James Burnside in Bethlehem – {{as of | 1998 | lc = on}} a historical museum (Burnside Plantation).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tnonline.com/archives/news/1998_weeklies/09.23/lehigh/briefs.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040709174002/http://www.tnonline.com/archives/news/1998_weeklies/09.23/lehigh/briefs.html|title=weekly news briefs|archivedate=July 9, 2004|work=tnonline.com}}</ref>

The prosperous village was incorporated into a free borough in the County of Northampton in 1845.  After the Unity Synod of 1848, Bethlehem became the headquarters of the Northern Province of the Moravian Church in North America.<ref>[http://www.moravian.org/history/ "Moravian Church in North America: Our History"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080829134130/http://www.moravian.org/history/ |date=August 29, 2008 }}</ref>

On March 27, 1900, [[the Bach Choir of Bethlehem]] presented the United States debut of German [[Lutheran]] [[Johann Sebastian Bach]]'s [[Mass in B Minor]] in the city's Central Moravian Church.

=== Boroughs merge ===
After the [[American Civil War|Civil War]] the Borough of South Bethlehem was formed. In 1886 the Borough of West Bethlehem (in Lehigh County) was formed. In 1904, the Boroughs of West Bethlehem (in Lehigh County) and Bethlehem (in Northampton County) merged. In 1917, the Borough of South Bethlehem and Bethlehem merged to become the City of Bethlehem, with Archibald Johnston (1865-1948) selected as the new city's first mayor. [[Bethlehem Township, Pennsylvania]] has remained a separate political entity. Even after the merger of the two boroughs, the bureau initially provided a count for the original sections.

=== Bethlehem Steel ===
[[File:Bethlehem steel c.1896.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Blast furnace]]s of Bethlehem Steel seen in a panoramic view from the north bank of the [[Lehigh River]]. South Mountain is in the distance. (c. 1896).]]

Bethlehem became a center of heavy industry and trade during the [[industrial revolution]]. The [[Bethlehem Steel|Bethlehem Steel Corporation]] (1857–2003), founded and based in Bethlehem, was once the second-largest steel producer in the United States, after [[Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania]]-based [[U.S. Steel]]. Bethlehem Steel was also one of the largest [[shipbuilding]] companies in the world and one of the most powerful symbols of American industrial manufacturing leadership.

Bethlehem Steel began producing the first wide-flange structural shapes made in the United States and they pioneered the production of the now-ubiquitous "I-beam" used in construction of steel-framed buildings, including skyscrapers. It manufactured construction materials for numerous New York and other city skyscrapers, as well as for major bridges.

The company became a major supplier of [[armor]] plate and ordnance products during [[World War I]] and [[World War II]], including the manufacture of 1,100 [[warship]]s. After roughly 140 years of metal production at its Bethlehem plant, Bethlehem Steel ceased operations there in 1995, in the face of overseas competition and declining demand.

=== Christmas star ===
{{Unreferenced section|date=March 2011}}

On December 7, 1937, at a grand ceremony during the [[Great Depression]], Mrs. Marion Brown Grace pulled a large switch to turn on the new Christmas street lights and a large wooden star. Mrs. Grace was the daughter of former South Bethlehem burgess, Charles F. Brown, and wife of Eugene Grace, President of [[Bethlehem Steel]] Corporation. Hundreds of citizens attended the ceremony and thousands more listened to the speeches and musical performances on the radio. This was the first year the Bethlehem [[Chamber of Commerce]] adopted the nickname "Christmas City, USA".

[[File:Star of Bethlehem Main Street 2382px.jpg|thumb|The star of Bethlehem viewed from Main Street at night, in 2007. The Hotel Bethlehem is located on the right side of the street.]]
The Hotel Bethlehem was chosen for the ceremony because it was built on the site of the first building in Bethlehem – a two-room log house – where on Christmas Eve 1741, the original settlers conducted their evening worship. As their benefactor, Count Zinzendorf, observed the farm animals that shared the space and listened to them sing the hymn, "Not Jerusalem, But Lowly Bethlehem", he proclaimed the name of the settlement to be Bethlehem. The people gathered at the 1937 ceremony heard the same words when the Bach Choir sang the old German hymn, "Jesu, Rufe Mich (Jesus, Call Thou Me)", by Adam Drese.

The ''Bethlehem Globe-Times'' paid for the large wooden star erected on the top of South Mountain, at a cost of $460. The original star was created with four wooden planks, overlapped to create an eight-point star, 60 feet high by 51 feet wide, mounted on two wooden poles, and lit by 150 50-watt light bulbs. The installation of the star was done by [[PPL (utility)|Pennsylvania Power and Light]] and the Bethlehem Water Department. The star was erected on the top of South Mountain, on property owned by the Water Department, located in Lower Saucon Township.

In 1939, the wooden star was replaced with a star made of Bethlehem steel, at a cost of $5,000. It had eight rays, with the main horizontal ray 81 feet wide and the main vertical ray 53 feet high. In 1967, the current star, 91 feet high, was installed on the old steel frame and set in a concrete base 25 feet wide by 5 feet deep. Plexiglas was installed to protect the 250 50-watt light bulbs. In the summer of 2006, the city repaired the base. A crew of municipal electricians changes the bulbs every two years.  Beginning in the mid-1990s, the star was lit from 4:30&nbsp;p.m. until midnight, every day of the year.

During World War II, from 1941 to 1945, none of the Christmas decorations in Bethlehem were lit. City officials said the lit star made "too good of an air raid target"{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}} and "during the global strife it didn't seem right for the lights to be all lit up when our boys were out in the darkness fighting for us".{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}} When lit, the star can be seen from as far as Wind Gap, {{convert|20|mi|km}} away. The star has become an important symbol for Bethlehem.

[[File:Monocacy Creek Bethlehem.jpg|thumb|right|[[Monocacy Creek (Lehigh River)|Monocacy Creek]] near downtown Bethlehem in 2007.]]
According to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of {{convert|19.4|sqmi|km2}}, of which, {{convert|19.3|sqmi|km2}} of it is land and {{convert|0.2|sqmi|km2}} of it (0.88%) is water. Bethlehem is about {{convert|50|mi|km}} north of [[Philadelphia]] and about {{convert|80|mi|km}} west of [[New York City]].

Because large volumes of water were required in the steelmaking process, the city purchased <span style="white-space:nowrap">{{convert|22,000|acre}}</span> of land in the [[Pocono Mountains]], where its water is stored in reservoirs.

=== Climate ===
Bethlehem has a [[humid continental climate]] (''Dfa''). Summers are typically hot and humid, fall and spring are generally mild, and winter is cold. Precipitation is distributed throughout the year, with thunderstorms in the summer, showers in spring and fall, and snow in winter. The average high temperature varies widely, from {{convert|36|°F|°C}} in January to {{convert|84|°F|°C}} in July. The highest recorded temperature was {{convert|105|°F|°C}}, while the lowest recorded temperature was {{convert|-16|°F|°C}}.
