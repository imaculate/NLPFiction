Their settlement was initially limited to the [[Shawmut Peninsula]], at that time surrounded by the [[Massachusetts Bay]] and [[Charles River]] and connected to the mainland by a narrow [[isthmus]]. The peninsula is thought to have been inhabited as early as 5000 BC.<ref>

In 1629, the [[Massachusetts Bay Colony]]'s first governor [[John Winthrop]] led the signing of the [[Cambridge Agreement]], a key founding document of the city. Puritan ethics and their focus on education influenced its early history;{{sfn|Christopher|2006|p=46}} America's first public school was founded in Boston in 1635.<ref name="BPS"/> Over the next 130 years, the city participated in four [[French and Indian Wars]], until the British defeated the French and their Indian allies in North America.

Boston was the largest town in [[British America]] until [[Philadelphia]] grew larger in the mid-18th century.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://bostonhistorycollaborative.com/pdf/Era2.pdf|title="Growth" to Boston in its Heyday, 1640s to 1730s|format=PDF |publisher=Boston History & Innovation Collaborative |year=2006 | page=2 | accessdate=March 5, 2013}}</ref> Boston's [[shore|oceanfront location]] made it a lively [[port]], and the city primarily engaged in [[shipping]] and fishing during its colonial days. However, Boston stagnated in the decades prior to the Revolution. By the mid-18th century, [[New York City]] and Philadelphia surpassed Boston in wealth. Boston encountered financial difficulties even as other cities in New England grew rapidly.<ref name="newamernation">{{cite book|last1=Smith|first1=Robert W.|title=Encyclopedia of the New American Nation|date=2005|publisher=Charles Scribners & Sons|location=Detroit, MI|isbn=978-0684313467|pages=214–219|edition=1st}}</ref><ref name="empireontheedge">{{cite book|last1=Bunker|first1=Nick|title=An Empire on the Edge: How Britain Came to Fight America|date=2014|publisher=Knopf|isbn=978-0307594846}}</ref>

Boston's penchant for mob action along with the colonists' growing distrust in Britain fostered a revolutionary spirit in the city.<ref name="newamernation" /> When the British government passed the [[Stamp Act 1765|Stamp Act]] in 1765, a Boston mob ravaged the homes of [[Andrew Oliver]], the official tasked with enforcing the Act, and [[Thomas Hutchinson (governor)|Thomas Hutchinson]], then the Lieutenant Governor of Massachusetts.<ref name="newamernation" /><ref>{{cite journal|last1=Morgan|first1=Edmund S.|title=Thomas Hutchinson and the Stamp Act|journal=The New England Quarterly|date=1946|volume=21|issue=4|pages=459–492|doi=10.2307/361566}}</ref> The British sent two regiments to Boston in 1768 in an attempt to quell the angry colonists. This did not sit well with the colonists. In 1770, during the [[Boston Massacre]], the army killed several people in response to a mob in Boston. The colonists compelled the British to withdraw their troops. The event was widely publicized and fueled a revolutionary movement in America.<ref name="empireontheedge" />

In 1773, Britain passed the [[Tea Act]]. Many of the colonists saw the act as an attempt to force them to accept the taxes established by the [[Townshend Acts]]. The act prompted the [[Boston Tea Party]], where a group of rebels threw an entire shipment of tea sent by the British [[East India Company]] into [[Boston Harbor]]. The Boston Tea Party was a key event leading up to the revolution, as the British government responded furiously with the [[Intolerable Acts]], demanding compensation for the lost tea from the rebels.<ref name="newamernation" /> This angered the colonists further and led to the [[American Revolutionary War]]. The war began in the area surrounding Boston with the [[Battles of Lexington and Concord]].<ref name="newamernation" /><ref name="frothingham">{{cite book | last = Frothingham, Jr | first = Richard | authorlink = | title = History of the Siege of Boston and of the Battles of Lexington, Concord, and Bunker Hill |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Cu9BAAAAIAAJ| publisher = Little and Brown | year = 1851}}</ref>

Boston itself was besieged for almost a year during the [[Siege of Boston]], which began on April 19, 1775. The New England militia impeded the movement of the [[British Army]]. [[William Howe, 5th Viscount Howe]], then the commander-in-chief of the British forces in North America, led the British army in the siege. On June 17, the British captured the [[Charlestown, Boston|Charlestown peninsula]] in Boston, during the [[Battle of Bunker Hill]]. The British army outnumbered the militia stationed there, but it was a [[Pyrrhic victory]] for the British because their army suffered devastating casualties. It was also a testament to the power and courage of the militia, as their stubborn defending made it difficult for the British to capture Charlestown without losing many troops.<ref name="allemn">{{cite book | last = French | first = Allen | authorlink =Allen French | title = The Siege of Boston | publisher = McMillan  | year = 1911 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PqZcY9z3Vn4C |ref=French }}</ref><ref name="1776book">{{cite book |last1=McCullough |first1=David |title=[[1776 (book)|1776]] |date=2005 |publisher=Simon & Schuster |location=New York, NY |isbn=978-0-7432-2671-4}}</ref>

Several weeks later, [[George Washington]] took over the militia after the [[Continental Congress]] established the [[Continental Army]] to unify the revolutionary effort. Both sides faced difficulties and supply shortages in the siege, and the fighting was limited to small-scale raids and skirmishes. On March 4, 1776, Washington commanded his army to [[Fortification of Dorchester Heights|fortify Dorchester Heights]], an area of Boston. The army placed cannons there to repel a British invasion against their stake in Boston. Washington was confident the army could resist a small-scale invasion with their fortifications. Howe planned an invasion into Boston, but bad weather delayed their advance. Howe decided to withdraw, because the storm gave Washington's army more time to improve their fortifications. British troops evacuated Boston on March 17, which solidified the revolutionaries' control of the city.<ref name="frothingham" /><ref name="allemn" />

Foreign trade returned after these hostilities, but Boston's merchants had found alternatives for their capital investments in the interim. Manufacturing became an important component of the city's economy, and the city's industrial manufacturing overtook international trade in economic importance by the mid-19th century. Boston remained one of the nation's largest manufacturing centers until the early 20th century, and was known for its garment production and leather-goods industries.<ref name="economy">{{cite web |title=Boston Economy |publisher=Advameg Inc.|work=City-Data.com|year=2007|url=http://www.city-data.com/us-cities/The-Northeast/Boston-Economy.html|accessdate=June 20, 2007}}</ref> A network of small rivers bordering the city and connecting it to the surrounding region facilitated shipment of goods and led to a proliferation of mills and factories.

In the 1820s, Boston's population grew rapidly, and the city's ethnic composition changed dramatically with the first wave of European [[Immigration to the United States|immigrants]].

The city went into decline by the early to mid-20th century, as factories became old and obsolete and businesses moved out of the region for cheaper labor elsewhere.{{sfn|Bluestone|Stevenson|2002|p=13}} Boston responded by initiating various [[urban renewal]] projects, under the direction of the [[Boston Planning and Development Agency|Boston Redevelopment Authority]] (BRA) established in 1957. In 1958, BRA initiated a project to improve the historic West End neighborhood. Extensive demolition was met with strong public opposition.<ref>{{cite news |author=Collins, Monica |url=http://www.boston.com/news/globe/magazine/articles/2005/08/07/born_again/ |title=Born Again |work=The Boston Globe |date=August 7, 2005|accessdate=May 8, 2007}}</ref>

The BRA subsequently re-evaluated its approach to urban renewal in its future projects, including the construction of the [[Government Center, Boston|Government Center]]. In 1965, the Columbia Point Health Center opened in the [[Dorchester, Boston|Dorchester]] neighborhood, the first [[Community health centers in the United States|Community Health Center]] in the United States. It mostly served the massive [[Columbia Point (Boston)|Columbia Point]] public housing complex adjoining it, which was built in 1953.

By the 1970s, the city's economy had recovered after 30 years of economic downturn. A large number of high-rises were constructed in the [[Financial District, Boston|Financial District]] and in Boston's [[Back Bay, Boston|Back Bay]] during this period.{{sfn|Kennedy|1994|p=195}} This boom continued into the mid-1980s and resumed after a few pauses. Hospitals such as [[Massachusetts General Hospital]], [[Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center]], and [[Brigham and Women's Hospital]] lead the nation in medical innovation and patient care. Schools such as [[Boston College]], [[Boston University]], the [[Harvard Medical School]], [[Tufts University School of Medicine]], [[Northeastern University]], [[Massachusetts College of Art and Design]], [[Wentworth Institute of Technology]], [[Berklee College of Music]], and [[Boston Conservatory]] attract students to the area. Nevertheless, the city experienced conflict starting in 1974 over [[desegregation busing]], which resulted in unrest and violence around public schools throughout the mid-1970s.{{sfn|Kennedy|1994|pp=194–195}}

Boston is surrounded by the "[[Greater Boston]]" region and is contiguously bordered by the [[New England town|cities and towns]] of [[Winthrop, Massachusetts|Winthrop]], [[Revere, Massachusetts|Revere]], [[Chelsea, Massachusetts|Chelsea]], [[Everett, Massachusetts|Everett]], [[Somerville, Massachusetts|Somerville]], [[Cambridge, Massachusetts|Cambridge]], [[Watertown, Massachusetts|Watertown]], [[Newton, Massachusetts|Newton]], [[Brookline, Massachusetts|Brookline]], [[Needham, Massachusetts|Needham]], [[Dedham, Massachusetts|Dedham]], [[Canton, Massachusetts|Canton]], [[Milton, Massachusetts|Milton]], and [[Quincy, Massachusetts|Quincy]]. The [[Charles River]] separates Boston from [[Watertown, Massachusetts|Watertown]] and the majority of Cambridge, and the mass of Boston from its own Charlestown neighborhood. To the east lie [[Boston Harbor]] and the [[Boston Harbor Islands National Recreation Area]] (which includes part of the city's territory, specifically [[Calf Island (Massachusetts)|Calf Island]], [[Gallops Island]], [[Great Brewster Island]], [[Green Island (Massachusetts)|Green Island]], [[Little Brewster Island]], [[Little Calf Island]], [[Long Island]], [[Lovells Island]], [[Middle Brewster Island]], [[Nixes Mate]], [[Outer Brewster Island]], [[Rainsford Island]], [[Shag Rocks (Massachusetts)|Shag Rocks]], [[Spectacle Island (Massachusetts)|Spectacle Island]], [[The Graves (Massachusetts)|The Graves]], and [[Thompson Island (Massachusetts)|Thompson Island]]). The [[Neponset River]] forms the boundary between Boston's southern neighborhoods and the city of [[Quincy, Massachusetts|Quincy]] and the town of [[Milton, Massachusetts|Milton]]. The [[Mystic River]] separates Charlestown from Chelsea and Everett, and Chelsea Creek and Boston Harbor separate East Boston from Boston proper.<ref>{{cite web

Like many major American cities, Boston has seen a great reduction in violent crime since the early 1990s. Boston's low crime rate since the 1990s has been credited to the [[Boston Police Department]]'s collaboration with neighborhood groups and church parishes to prevent youths from joining gangs, as well as involvement from the [[United States Attorney|United States Attorney and District Attorney]]'s offices. This helped lead in part to what has been touted as the "Boston Miracle". Murders in the city dropped from 152 in 1990 (for a murder rate of 26.5 per 100,000 people) to just 31—not one of them a juvenile—in 1999 (for a murder rate of 5.26 per 100,000).<ref name="End of a Miracle">{{cite web |author=Winship, Christopher |date=March 2002 |url=http://www.wjh.harvard.edu/soc/faculty/winship/End_of_a_Miracle.pdf |format=PDF |title=End of a Miracle? |publisher=Harvard University |accessdate=February 19, 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120522063733/http://www.wjh.harvard.edu/soc/faculty/winship/End_of_a_Miracle.pdf |archivedate=May 22, 2012}}</ref>

==Environment==

===Pollution control===
[[Air quality]] in Boston is generally very good. Between 2004–2013, there were only four days in which the air was unhealthy for the general public, according to the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|EPA]].<ref name="EPA AirCompare">{{cite web|title=EPA AirCompare Historical Profile|url=http://www.epa.gov/cgi-bin/broker?_service=aircomp&_debug=0&_program=dataprog.wcj_byyearhealth.sas&geocode=25025&condition=none&citycounty=county|publisher=Environmental Protection Agency|accessdate=December 26, 2014}}</ref>

Some of the cleaner energy facilities in Boston include the Allston green district, with three ecologically compatible housing facilities.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.allaccessboston.com/Green-District-Allston|title=The Green District Allston|work=Encore Realty}}</ref> Boston is also breaking ground on multiple [[green affordable housing]] facilities to help reduce the carbon impact of the city while simultaneously making these initiatives financially available to a greater population. Boston's climate plan is updated every three years and was most recently modified in 2013. This legislature includes the Building Energy Reporting and Disclosure Ordinance, which requires the city's larger buildings to disclose their yearly energy and water use statistics and to partake in an energy assessment every five years. These statistics are made public by the city, thereby increasing incentives for buildings to be more environmentally conscious.<ref name="scorecard.goodguide.com">{{cite web|url=http://scorecard.goodguide.com/community/index.tcl?zip_code=02108&set_community_zipcode_cookie_p=t&x=16&y=7|title=About Your Community|work=goodguide.com}}</ref>

Mayor Thomas Menino introduced the Renew Boston Whole Building Incentive which reduces the cost of living in buildings that are deemed energy efficient. This gives people an opportunity to find housing in neighborhoods that support the environment. The ultimate goal of this initiative is to enlist 500 Bostonians to participate in a free, in-home energy assessment.<ref name="scorecard.goodguide.com"/>

===Water purity and availability===
Many older buildings in certain areas of Boston are supported by wooden piles driven into the area's fill; these piles remain sound if submerged in water, but are subject to [[dry rot]] if exposed to air for long periods.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bsces.org/index.cfm/page/Where-Has-All-the-Water-Gone-Left-Piles-Rotting.../cdid/10778/pid/10371|title=Where Has All the Water Gone?

In addition to city government, numerous commissions and state authorities—including the Massachusetts [[Department of Conservation and Recreation]], the [[Boston Public Health Commission]], the [[Massachusetts Water Resources Authority|Massachusetts Water Resources Authority (MWRA)]], and the [[Massachusetts Port Authority|Massachusetts Port Authority (Massport)]]—play a role in the life of Bostonians. As the capital of Massachusetts, Boston plays a major role in [[Massachusetts#Politics|state politics]].

The city has several federal facilities, including the [[John F. Kennedy Federal Office Building]], the [[Thomas P. O'Neill Jr. Federal Building (Boston)|Thomas P. O'Neill Jr. Federal Building]],<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gsa.gov/portal/content/104959 |title=Massachusetts Real Estate Portfolio |publisher=United States General Services Administration |accessdate=March 11, 2014 }}</ref> the [[John W. McCormack Post Office and Courthouse]], the [[Federal Reserve Bank of Boston]], the [[United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit]], and the [[United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts]]. Both courts are housed in the [[John Joseph Moakley United States Courthouse]].

Federally, Boston is split between two congressional districts. The northern three-fourths of the city is in the [[Massachusetts's 7th congressional district|7th district]], represented by [[Ayanna Pressley]]. The southern fourth is in the [[Massachusetts's 8th congressional district|8th district]], represented by [[Stephen Lynch (politician)|Stephen Lynch]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.govtrack.us/congress/findyourreps.xpd?state=MA |title=Massachusetts's Representatives – Congressional District Maps |year=2007 |publisher=GovTrack.us |accessdate=April 28, 2007}}</ref> Both are Democrats; a Republican has not represented a significant portion of Boston in over a century. The state's senior member of the [[United States Senate]] is Democrat [[Elizabeth Warren]], first elected in 2012. The state's junior member of the United States Senate is Democrat [[Ed Markey]], who was elected in 2013 to succeed [[John Kerry]] after Kerry's appointment and confirmation as the [[United States Secretary of State]].

The city uses an algorithm created by the Walsh administration, called CityScore, to measure the effectiveness of various city services. This score is available on a public online dashboard and allows city managers in police, fire, schools, emergency management services, and [[3-1-1]] to take action and make adjustments in areas of concern.<ref>{{cite news |last=Irons |first=Meghan E. |url=https://www.bostonglobe.com/metro/2016/08/17/city-hall-always-above-average-you-ask-city-hall/GUvNcsQlIhJYt8SPgjLzCN/story.html |title=City Hall is always above average – if you ask City Hall |work=[[The Boston Globe]] |date=August 17, 2016 |accessdate=August 18, 2016 }}</ref>
