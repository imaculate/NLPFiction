'''''The Pennsylvania Gazette''''' was one of the [[United States]]' most prominent newspapers from 1728, before the time period of the [[American Revolution]], until 1800.

==History==
[[Image:Pennsylvania Gazette (May 9, 1754), page 1.jpg|thumb|left|upright|''The Pennsylvania Gazette'' for May 9, 1754]]
The newspaper was first published in 1728 by [[Samuel Keimer]] and was the second newspaper to be published in [[Pennsylvania]] under the name ''The Universal Instructor in all Arts and Sciences: and Pennsylvania Gazette'', alluding to Keimer's intention to print out a page of [[Ephraim Chambers]]' ''[[Cyclopaedia, or Universal Dictionary of Arts and Sciences]]'' in each copy.<ref name="loc">{{cite web|title=Pennsylvania Gazette, Philadelphia|url=https://www.loc.gov/rr/news/circulars/pagazette.txt|accessdate=December 7, 2006|date=2006|publisher=Library of Congress}}</ref> On October 2, 1729, [[Benjamin Franklin]] and [[Hugh Meredith]] bought the paper and shortened its name, as well as dropping Keimer's grandiose plan to print out the ''Cyclopaedia''.<ref name="loc" /> Franklin not only printed the paper but also often contributed pieces to the paper under [[pseudonym|aliases]]. His newspaper soon became the most successful in the colonies.

On August 6, 1741 Franklin published an editorial about deceased [[Andrew Hamilton (lawyer)|Andrew Hamilton]], a lawyer and public figure in Philadelphia who had been a friend. The editorial praised the man highly and showed Franklin had held the man in high esteem.<ref>{{cite book|last=Konkle|first=Burton Alva|title=Benjamin Chew 1722–1810: Head of the Pennsylvania Judiciary System Under Colony and Commonwealth|year=1932|publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press|location=Philadelphia, PA|pages=17–29 (28–29)}}</ref>

On October 19, [[1752]] <ref>Tom Tucker, ''Bolt Of Fate: Benjamin Franklin And His Fabulous Kite'' (PublicAffairs, 2009) p135</ref> , Franklin published a third-person account of his pioneering [[kite experiment]] in ''The Pennsylvania Gazette'', without mentioning that he himself had performed it.<ref>Steven Johnson (2008) ''The Invention of Air'', p. 39 {{ISBN|978-1-59448-401-8}}</ref>

Primarily a publication for classified ads, merchants and individuals listed notices of employment, lost and found goods and items for sale; the newspaper also reprinted foreign news. Most entries involved stories of travel.<ref>[https://www.academia.edu/4563002/Travel_Writing_Travel_Reading_in_Benjamin_Franklins_1747_Pennsylvania_Gazette Zach Hutchins, "Travel Writing, Travel Reading, and the Boundaries of Genre: Embracing the Banal in Franklin's 1747 Pennsylvania Gazette," Studies in Travel Writing 17.3 (2013):300-19.]</ref>

This newspaper, among other firsts, would print the first [[editorial cartoon|political cartoon]] in America, ''[[Join, or Die]]'', authored by Franklin himself.<ref>{{cite web|title=Today in History: January 17|url=http://memory.loc.gov/ammem/today/jan17.html|accessdate=December 8, 2006|year=2006|publisher=Library of Congress}}</ref> It ceased publication in 1800, ten years after Franklin's death.<ref name="accessible.com">[http://www.accessible.com/accessible/aboutPG.jsp]</ref>

It is claimed that the publication later reemerged as the ''[[Saturday Evening Post]]'' in 1821.<ref>[http://saturdayeveningpost.com/About-The-Saturday-Evening-Post.html About the ''Saturday Evening Post''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090222211321/http://saturdayeveningpost.com/About-The-Saturday-Evening-Post.html |date=February 22, 2009 }}</ref>

There are three known copies of the original issue, which are held by the Historical Society of Pennsylvania, the Library Company of Philadelphia, and the Wisconsin State Historical Society.<ref name="loc" />

{{Anchor| alumni magazine}}Today, ''The Pennsylvania Gazette'' moniker is used by an unrelated bi-monthly alumni magazine of the [[University of Pennsylvania]], which Franklin founded and served as a trustee.
