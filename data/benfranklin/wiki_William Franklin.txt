'''William Franklin''' [[Royal Society of Edinburgh|FRSE]] ({{circa}} 1730 – November 1813) was an [[British America|American-born]] attorney, soldier, politician, and [[Colonialism|colonial administrator]]. He was the acknowledged illegitimate son of [[Benjamin Franklin]], one of the most prominent of the [[Patriot (American Revolution)|Patriot leaders of the American Revolution]] and a [[Founding Fathers of the United States|Founding Father of the United States]]. The last colonial [[Governor of New Jersey]] (1763–1776), Franklin was a steadfast [[Loyalist (American Revolution)|Loyalist]] throughout the [[American Revolutionary War]]. 

Following imprisonment by Patriots in 1776-78, he became the chief leader of the Loyalists.  From his base in New York City he organized military units to fight on the British side. In 1782 he went into exile in Britain. He lived in London until his death.

==Early life==
William Franklin was born in [[Philadelphia]], [[Pennsylvania]], then a colony in [[British America]]. He was the illegitimate son of [[Benjamin Franklin]], a leading figure in the city. His mother's identity is unknown.<ref name="britannica.com" /> Confusion exists about William's birth and parentage because Benjamin was secretive about his son's origins. In 1750, Ben told his own mother that William was nineteen years old,<ref name="Randall, p. 43" /> but this may have been an attempt to make the youth appear legitimate.

William was raised by Benjamin Franklin and [[Deborah Read]], his [[common-law marriage|common-law wife]]; William always called her his mother.<ref name= "Randall, p. 43" /> There is some speculation{{Sfn | Hart | 1911}} that Deborah Read was William's mother, and that because of his parents' common-law relationship, the circumstances of his birth were obscured so as not to be politically harmful to him or to their marital arrangement.

William joined a company of Pennsylvania provincial troops in 1746 and fought in [[Albany, New York|Albany]] in [[King George's War]], obtaining the rank of captain in 1747.{{Sfn|Skemp|1990|p=10}} As he grew older, he accompanied his father on several missions, including trips to [[England]]. Although often depicted as a young child when he assisted his father in the famed [[kite experiment]] of 1752, William was at least 21&nbsp;years old at the time.

==Marriage and family==
As a young man, William became engaged to [[Elizabeth Graeme Ferguson|Elizabeth Graeme]], daughter of prominent Philadelphia physician Dr. Thomas Graeme<ref name="ushistory.org" /> and granddaughter of Pennsylvania's 14th Governor, [[William Keith (colonial governor)|Sir William Keith]]. Neither family approved of the match, but when William went to London to study [[law]] about 1759, he left with the understanding that Elizabeth would wait for him.

While in London, Franklin sired an illegitimate son, [[William Temple Franklin]], who was born 22 February 1762. His mother has never been identified, and Temple was placed in foster care.<ref name="WTFpapers" />

Later that year, Franklin married Elizabeth Downes on 4 September 1762 at [[St George's, Hanover Square]] in London. She was born in the English colony of [[Barbados]] to the sugar [[Plantation|planter]] John Downes and his wife Elizabeth ({{nee|Parsons}}). She met Franklin while visiting England with her father in 1760.<ref name = "Burstyn" /> They moved to the New Jersey colony in 1763. Elizabeth died in 1777 while he was imprisoned as a Loyalist during the [[American Revolutionary War]]. She was interred beneath the altar of [[St. Paul's Chapel]] in lower Manhattan, where she had resided after the British evacuated [[Perth Amboy]]. The memorial plaque on the wall at St. Paul's was commissioned by William Franklin from London, where he went into exile following the war.<ref name="Burstyn" /> He was a widower for more than ten years.

On 14 August 1788, William married Mary Johnson d'Evelin, a wealthy Irish widow with children, to become his second wife.<ref name="WTFpapers" /> William's son Temple, after a failed business career in the U.S., lived with his father and stepmother for a time, and followed his grandfather and father's footsteps and had an illegitimate daughter, Ellen (May 15, 1798 [[London]] – 1875 [[Nice]], [[France]]), with the sister-in-law of his stepmother Mary named Ellen Johnson d'Evelin.<ref>Daniel Mark Epstein (2017), ''The Loyal Son: The War in Ben Franklin's House'', pp 382</ref> William took responsibility for his granddaughter Ellen. Temple moved to Paris, where he lived the remainder of his life and never saw his father again.<ref>Sheila L. Skemp (1990) ''William Franklin: Son of a Patriot, Servant of a King'', pp 274</ref> After Mary died in 1811, William continued to live with Ellen, age 13 at the time, and when he died in 1813 he left most of his small estate to Ellen.<ref>Skemp, pp 274</ref>

==Career==
William Franklin completed his law education in England, and was admitted to the bar. William and Benjamin Franklin became partners and confidants, working together to pursue land grants in what was then called the Northwest (now [[Midwest]]). Before they left England, the senior Franklin lobbied hard to procure his son an appointment, especially working with the Prime Minister [[John Stuart, 3rd Earl of Bute|Lord Bute]].

In 1763, William Franklin was appointed as the Royal Governor of [[Province of New Jersey|New Jersey]].  He had asked Prime Minister [[John Stuart, 3rd Earl of Bute|Bute]] for the position. It was the secret decision of the Prime Minister Bute, who kept it secret even from Benjamin Franklin. It was a reward for his father's role, and done to weaken the Penn faction.<ref>H. W. Brands, ''The First American: The life and times of Benjamin Franklin'' (2000) pp 327-28.</ref><ref>R. C.  Simmons, "Colonial Patronage: Two Letters from William Franklin to the Earl of Bute, 1762." ''William and Mary Quarterly'' 59.1 (2002): 123-134. </ref>  He replaced [[Josiah Hardy]], a merchant and colonial administrator who sided with the New Jersey legislature against the government in London. Randall states:
:Franklin proved an able governor; avoiding quarrels with the assembly, he put forth effort to bring about popular reforms, such as the improvement of roads and construction of bridges. He also worked to secure crop subsidies from England and founded the colony's chancery courts. He encouraged the assembly to grant a charter to Rutgers, the state university, and curtailed imprisonment for debt. He pardoned 105 women sentenced to jail for adultery during his fourteen-year term. The Delaware Indians nicknamed him "Dispenser of Justice" after he hanged two Sussex County men for beheading a prisoner during the Pontiac Rebellion. He also established the first Indian reservation in America at Brotherton in Burlington County.<ref>Randall, ''American National Biography'' (2000)</ref>

===American War of Independence===
[[File:ProprietaryHousePerthAmboy.JPG|thumb|[[Proprietary House]] in [[ Perth Amboy]], where Franklin lived as governor]]
Owing to his father's role as a [[Founding Father]] and William's loyalty to Britain, the relationship between father and son became strained past the breaking point. When Benjamin decided to take up the Patriot cause, he tried to convince William to join him, but the son refused.  After Ben Franklin was systematically ridiculed and humiliated by [[Solicitor General for England and Wales|Solicitor-General]] [[Alexander Wedderburn, 1st Earl of Rosslyn|Alexander Wedderburn]] before the [[Privy Council of the United Kingdom|Privy Council]] on January 29, 1774, he expected his son to resign in protest. Instead, William advised his father to take his medicine and retire from office.<ref> Sheila L. Skemp,  "Benjamin Franklin, Patriot, and William Franklin, Loyalist." ''Pennsylvania History'' 65.1 (1998): 35-45.</ref>   Skemp  says  "He did not abandon Benjamin, but Benjamin abandoned him."  
His Loyalist position reflected his respect for benevolent authority and was consistent with his father's earlier anglophilia.  William was a devout member of the Church of England, which reinforced his anglophilia. Financially he needed the salary and perquisites. <ref> Sheila L. Skemp, "William Franklin: His Father's Son." ''Pennsylvania Magazine of History and Biography'' 109.2 (1985): 145-178.</ref>

William Franklin remained as governor of New Jersey, and secretly reported Patriot activities to London. He continued as governor until January 1776, when colonial militiamen placed him under house arrest, which lasted until the middle of June. After the Declaration of Independence, Franklin was formally taken into custody by order of the [[Provincial Congress of New Jersey]], an entity which he refused to recognize, regarding it as an "illegal assembly."{{Sfn|Skemp|1990|p=211}} He was incarcerated in Connecticut for two years, in [[Wallingford, Connecticut|Wallingford]] and [[Middletown, Connecticut|Middletown]]. He surreptitiously engaged Americans in supporting the Loyalist cause. Discovered, he was held in solitary confinement at [[Litchfield, Connecticut]] for eight months. When finally released in a prisoner exchange in 1778, he moved to New York City, which was still occupied by the British.<ref name="Info please" />

Once in New York, Boyd Schlenther says he became, "the acknowledged leader of the American loyalists, for whom he struggled to secure aid. He also built up an unofficial yet active spy network. "<ref> Schlenther, ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography'' (2008).</ref> He set up  Loyalist military units to fight the Patriots, such as  "[[John Bacon (Loyalist)|Bacon's Refugees]]". In 1779, he had learned through his friend [[Jonathan Odell]], and British Secret Service agent [[John André]], that [[Benedict Arnold]] was secretly defecting to the British.<ref name="Randall 1990" />

===Asgill Affair===
{{Main |Asgill Affair}}
While in New York, Franklin tried to encourage a [[guerrilla war]] and active reprisals against the rebels but was frustrated by British Commander-in-Chief [[General Clinton]], who did not support this. In 1782 Franklin was implicated in the Loyalist officer [[Richard Lippincott (Loyalist)|Richard Lippincott]]'s hanging of [[Joshua Huddy]]. During a raid, Loyalist troops under Franklin's general oversight captured Joshua Huddy, an officer of the New Jersey [[militia]]. The Loyalist soldiers hanged Huddy in revenge for similar killings of Loyalists, particularly Phillip White. Huddy was a member of the Association of Retaliation, a [[vigilante]] body with a history of attacking and killing Loyalists and Neutrals in New Jersey.<ref>Fleming, pp. 188–89.</ref> At the time, some alleged that Franklin had sanctioned the killing of Huddy. This claim was theoretically substantiated by a note left on Huddy's body, which read, "Up goes Huddy for Philip White."

When he heard of Huddy's death, General [[George Washington]] threatened to execute Captain [[Sir Charles Asgill, 2nd Baronet|Charles Asgill]], a British officer who had been [[Siege of Yorktown|captured at Yorktown]], unless Lippincott were handed over to the American military. The British refused, but tried Lippincott. The British acquitted him of charges in the hanging. Due to the intervention of the French King [[Louis XVI]], who interceded with his American allies to prevent Asgill's execution, the British officer was eventually exchanged by the Americans. Despite the speed with which it was terminated, the Asgill Affair temporarily stalled peace talks between American and British authorities, extending uncertainty over the United States' prospects. Ironically, Benjamin Franklin was a senior negotiator for the revolutionary Americans in Paris when the Asgill Affair occurred.

==Exile==
The [[Surrender at Yorktown]] in October 1781 dimmed British hopes for victory, and in 1782, William Franklin departed for Britain, never to return. Once in London, he became a leading spokesman for the Loyalist community. Because of the continued strength of British forces in North America, in spite of the disaster at Yorktown, many expected Britain to continue fighting the war. The British naval victory against the French at the [[Battle of the Saintes]] and the successful [[Great Siege of Gibraltar|defence of Gibraltar]] also raised their hopes. In summer 1782, a [[Shelburne Ministry|new British government]] came to power, who still hoped to achieve a reconciliation with the American colonies.

In 1783 he visited Scotland and was asked to be a founding member of the [[Royal Society of Edinburgh]].<ref name="RSE 2006" />

Benjamin Franklin dedicated his autobiography (written before the war) to his son,<ref name="Franklin (2)" /> though the only mention of William within the manuscript is the inclusion of a newspaper article in which Franklin noted that his son was authorized to make contracts to purchase carts for the British army.<ref name="Franklin (3)" /> But Ben and his son were never reconciled; the elder Franklin became known for his uncompromising position related to not providing compensation nor amnesty for the Loyalists who left the colonies, during the negotiations in Paris for the [[Peace of Paris (1783)|Peace of Paris]]. His son's reputation as a Loyalist contributed to his position.<ref> Fleming, Thomas, The Perils of Peace: America's Struggle for Survival, (Collins, New York, 2007) 236</ref> The British government gave him £1,800 from the Commissioners of Loyalist Claims. That was the value of his furniture; there was no payment for his lands. He also received a brigadier's half-pay pension of £800 per year.<ref>W.S. Randall, ''American National Biography'' (2000).</ref>
 
William Franklin sent a letter to his father, dated 22 July 1784, in an attempt at reconciliation. His father never accepted his position, but responded in a letter dated 16 August 1784, in which he states "[We] will endeavor, as you propose mutually to forget what has happened relating to it, as well we can."<ref name="Franklin" /> William saw his father one last time in 1785, when Benjamin stopped in Britain on his return journey to the U.S. after his time in France. The meeting was brief and involved tying up outstanding legal matters. In a reconciliation attempt, Benjamin also proposed that his son give land that he owned in New York and New Jersey to William's son [[William Temple Franklin|Temple]], who had served as Ben's secretary during the war and for whom the elder Franklin had great affection, in order to repay a debt William owed his father; in the event, William only ever transferred the New York portion of the land.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://yalealumnimagazine.com/articles/4292-ben-franklins-family-quarrel|title=Ben Franklins family quarrel|last=Asmar|first=Melanie|date=May 2016|website=Yale Alumni Magazine|publisher=|access-date=2016-09-14}}</ref> In his 1788 will, Benjamin left William virtually none of his wealth, except some nearly worthless territory in [[Nova Scotia]] and some property already in William's possession. He said that had Britain won the war, he would have had no wealth to leave his son.<ref name=" Franklin (1)" />

William died in 1813, and was buried in London's [[St Pancras Old Church]] churchyard. The grave is lost.
