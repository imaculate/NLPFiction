A '''Leyden jar''' (or '''Leiden jar''') stores a high-voltage [[electric charge]] (from an external source) between [[electrical conductor]]s on the inside and outside of a glass jar.  A Leyden jar typically consists of a glass jar with metal foil cemented to the inside and the outside surfaces, and a metal terminal projecting vertically through the jar lid to make contact with the inner foil. It was the original form of the [[capacitor]]<ref name="Dummer">{{cite book| last1  = Dummer| first1 = G. W.

Its invention was a discovery made independently by German cleric [[Ewald Georg von Kleist]] on 11 October 1745 and by Dutch scientist [[Pieter van Musschenbroek]] of [[Leiden]] (Leyden) in 1745–1746.<ref>{{Cite book | last = Heilbron| first = J.L.| author-link=John L.

The Leyden jar was used to conduct many early experiments in electricity, and its discovery was of fundamental importance in the study of [[electrostatics]]. The Leyden jar was the first means of accumulating and preserving electric charge in large quantities that could be discharged at the experimenter's will, thus overcoming a significant limit to early research into electrical conduction.<ref>{{cite book | last = Baigrie | first = B.  | year = 2007 | title = Electricity and Magnetism: A Historical Perspective | url =  | page =  29 | publisher = [[Greenwood Publishing Group|Greenwood Press]] | isbn = 978-0-313-33358-3}}</ref> Leyden jars are still used in education to demonstrate the principles of electrostatics.

The [[Ancient Greeks]] already knew that pieces of [[amber]] could attract lightweight particles after being rubbed. The amber becomes electrified by [[triboelectric effect]],{{efn|The prefix ''tribo-'' (Greek for ‘rub’) refers to ‘friction’}} mechanical separation of charge in a [[dielectric]]. The Greek word for amber is ἤλεκτρον ("ēlektron") and is the origin of the word "electricity".<ref>{{cite web|title=electric|url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/electric|website=Merriam-Webster|accessdate=12 May 2017|quote=Origin and Etymology of ''electric'': New Latin ''electricus'' 'produced from amber by friction, electric', from Medieval Latin, 'of amber', from Latin ''electrum'' 'amber, electrum', from Greek ''ēlektron''; akin to Greek ''ēlektōr'' 'beaming sun'. First Known Use: 1722}}</ref>

Around 1650, [[Otto von Guericke]] built a crude [[electrostatic generator]]: a [[sulfur|sulphur]] ball that rotated on a shaft. When Guericke held his hand against the ball and turned the shaft quickly, a static [[electric charge]] built up. This experiment inspired the development of several forms of "friction machines", that greatly helped in the study of electricity.

The Leyden jar was effectively discovered independently by two parties: German deacon [[Ewald Georg von Kleist]], who made the first discovery, and Dutch scientists [[Pieter van Musschenbroek]] and Andreas Cunaeus, who figured out how it worked only when held in the hand.<ref>{{Gutenberg |bullet=none |no=5641 |name=Man or Matter |first=Ernst |last=Lehrs |accessdate=2017-05-12 |authorlink=Ernst Lehrs |origyear=1951 |publisher=Klostermann |year=1953 |edition=3rd  |ISBN= 3-465-00285-7}}</ref>

Despite its mundane and safe appearance, the Leyden jar is a high voltage device, and it is estimated that at a maximum the early Leyden jars could collect electrical energy from friction in a range from 20,000 to 60,000 volts.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Anders |first1=A. |title=Tracking down the origin of arc plasma science I.

===Von Kleist===
[[Ewald Georg von Kleist]] discovered the immense storage capability of the Leyden jar while working under a theory that saw electricity as a fluid, and hoped a glass jar filled with alcohol would "capture" this fluid.<ref>Thomas S. Kuhn, ''The Structure of Scientific Revolutions'' (Chicago, Illinois: University of Chicago Press, 1996) page 17.</ref> He was the deacon at the cathedral of Camin in Pomerania.

In October 1745 von Kleist tried to accumulate electricity in a small medicine bottle filled with alcohol with a nail inserted in the cork. He was following up on an experiment developed by [[Georg Matthias Bose]] where electricity had been sent through water to set alcoholic spirits alight. He attempted to charge the bottle from a large prime conductor (invented by Bose) suspended above his friction machine.

Kleist was convinced that a substantial electric charge could be collected and held within the glass which he knew would provide an obstacle to the escape of the 'fluid'. He received a significant shock from the device when he accidentally touched the nail through the cork while still cradling the bottle in his other hand. He communicated his results to at least five different electrical experimenters,<ref>{{Cite book | last = Heilbron| first = J.L.| author-link=John L.

Gralath (in collabration with {{ill |Gottfried Reyger|de}}) succeeded in getting the intended effect on 5 March 1746, holding a small glass medicine bottle with a nail inside in one hand, moving it close to an electrostatic generator, and then moving the other hand close to the nail.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Silva|first1=C.S.|last2=Heering|first2=P. | title=Re-examining the early history of the Leiden jar: Stabilization and variation in transforming a phenomenon into a fact| journal=History of Science|volume=56|issue=3|pages=314–342| date=2018| doi=10.1177/0073275318768418 |pmid=29683000}}</ref> Kleist didn't understand the significance of his conducting hand holding the bottle—and both he and his correspondents were loath to hold the device when told that the shock could throw them across the room.

===Musschenbroek and Cunaeus===
{{refimprove section|date=July 2016}}
The Leyden jar's invention was long credited to [[Pieter van Musschenbroek]], the physics professor at [[University of Leiden]], who also ran a family foundry which cast brass cannonettes, and a small business (''De Oosterse Lamp'' – "The Eastern Lamp") which made scientific and medical instruments for the new university courses in physics and for scientific gentlemen keen to establish their own 'cabinets' of curiosities and instruments.

Like Kleist, Musschenbroek was also interested in and attempting to repeat Bose's experiment.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Heilbron|first1=John L.|authorlink=John L. Heilbron |title=G. M. Bose: The prime mover in the invention of the Leyden jar?|journal=Isis|date=1966|volume=57|issue=2|pages=264–267|jstor=227966}}</ref> During this time, Andreas Cunaeus, a lawyer, came to learn about this experiment from visiting Musschenbroek's laboratory and Cunaeus attempted to duplicate the experiment at home with household items.<ref>{{cite book  |title=Electricity in the 17th and 18th centuries: a study of early Modern physics |last=Heilbron |authorlink=John L.

He reported his procedure and experience to [[Jean-Nicolas-Sébastien Allamand|Allamand]], Musschenbroek's colleague.  Allamand  and Musschenbroek also received severe shocks.  Musschenbroek communicated the experiment in a letter from 20 January 1746 to [[René Antoine Ferchault de Réaumur]],  who was Musschenbroek's appointed correspondent at the Paris Academy. [[Jean-Antoine Nollet|Abbé Nollet]] read this report, confirmed the experiment, and then read Musschenbroek's letter in a public meeting of the Paris Academy in April 1746<ref>{{cite book  |title=Electricity in the 17th and 18th centuries: a study of early Modern physics |last=Heilbron |authorlink=John L.

Musschenbroek's outlet in France for the sale of his company's  'cabinet' devices was the Abbé Nollet (who started building and selling duplicate instruments in 1735<ref>{{cite encyclopedia|title=Nollet, Jean-Antoine|edition=2nd | date=2000 | publisher=Charles Scribner's Sons |work=Concise dictionary of scientific biography |page=652| url=https://archive.org/stream/concisedictionar00#page/652/mode/2up}}</ref>).  Nollet then gave the electrical storage device the name "Leyden jar" and promoted it as a special type of flask to his market of wealthy men with scientific curiosity.
The "Kleistian jar" was therefore promoted as the ''Leyden jar'', and as having been discovered by [[Pieter van Musschenbroek]] and his acquaintance Andreas Cunaeus.  Musschenbroek, however, never claimed that he had invented it, <ref>{{cite book  |title=Electricity in the 17th and 18th centuries: a study of early Modern physics |last=Heilbron |authorlink=John L.

===Further developments===
Within months after Musschenbroek's report about how to reliably create a Leyden jar, other electrical researchers were making and experimenting with their own Leyden jars.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Priestley|first1=Joseph|title=The History and Present State of Electricity, with original experiments|date=1775|location=London|pages=108|edition=3rd|url=https://archive.org/stream/historyandprese00priegoog#page/n154/mode/2up/|accessdate=25 April 2018|publisher=London : Printed for C.

This functioning apparatus, without glass, created a problem for Benjamin Franklin's explanation of the Leyden jar, which maintained that the charge was located in the glass.<ref>{{Cite book | last = Heilbron| first = J.L.| author-link=John L.

By the middle of the 19th century, the Leyden jar had become common enough for writers to assume their readers knew of and understood its basic operation.{{Citation needed|date=December 2011}} Around the turn of the century it began to be widely used in [[spark-gap transmitter]]s and medical [[electrotherapy]] equipment. By the early 20th century, improved dielectrics and the need to reduce their size and undesired [[inductance]] and [[Electrical resistance|resistance]] for use in the new technology of [[radio]] caused the Leyden jar to evolve into the modern compact form of [[capacitor]].

== Design ==
[[Image:Leyden jar showing construction.png|thumb|upright=0.7|left|Leyden jar construction.]]
A typical design consists of a [[glass]] jar with conducting tin foil coating the inner and outer surfaces. The foil coatings stop short of the mouth of the jar, to prevent the charge from arcing between the foils. A metal rod [[electrode]] projects through the stopper at the mouth of the jar, electrically connected by some means (usually a hanging chain) to the inner foil, to allow it to be charged. The jar is charged by an [[electrostatic generator]], or other source of electric charge, connected to the inner electrode while the outer foil is [[ground (electricity)|grounded]]. The inner and outer surfaces of the jar store equal but opposite charges.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://electronics.howstuffworks.com/capacitor3.htm | title=How Capacitors Work| date=2007-09-17}}</ref>

The original form of the device was just a glass bottle partially filled with water, with a metal wire passing through a cork closing it. The role of the outer plate was provided by the hand of the experimenter. Soon [[John Bevis]] found (in 1747) that it was possible to coat the exterior of the jar with metal foil, and he also found that he could achieve the same effect by using a plate of glass with metal foil on both sides.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Wolf|first1=A|last2=McKie|first2=D.|title=A history of science, technology and philosophy in the 18th century|date=1962|publisher=George Allen & Unwin|location=London|page=224|edition=2nd|url=https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.460063/2015.460063.A-History#page/n261/mode/2up}}</ref> These developments inspired [[William Watson (scientist)|William Watson]] in the same year to have a jar made with a metal foil lining both inside and outside, dropping the use of water.<ref>{{multiref|{{cite book|last1=Wolf|first1=A|last2=McKie|first2=D.|title=A history of science, technology and philosophy in the 18th century|date=1962|publisher=George Allen & Unwin|location=London|page=224|edition=2nd|url=https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.460063/2015.460063.A-History#page/n261/mode/2up}}|{{cite journal|last1=Watson|first1=W.|title=III.

Early experimenters (such as [[Benjamin Wilson (painter)|Benjamin Wilson]] in 1746) reported that the thinner the [[dielectric]] and the greater the surface, the greater the charge that could be accumulated.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Anders |first1=André |title=Cathodic Arcs: From Fractal Spots to Energetic Condensation |volume=50 |date=2008 |publisher=Springer |location=New York |isbn=978-0-387-79108-1 |url=https://books.google.dk/books?id=rwIUhsbBHQYC&pg=PA9|page=9 |doi=10.1007/978-0-387-79108-1_2|chapter=A Brief History of Cathodic Arc Coating |series=Springer Series on Atomic, Optical, and Plasma Physics }}</ref>

Further developments in electrostatics revealed that the dielectric material was not essential, but increased the storage capability ([[capacitance]]) and prevented arcing between the plates. Two plates separated by a small distance also act as a capacitor, even in a [[vacuum]].

== Storage of the charge ==
[[File:Dissectible Leyden jar.png|thumb|upright=0.4|"Dissectible" Leyden jar, 1876]]
[[File:Leyden unit jar.png|thumb|upright|Measuring Leyden jar]]
It was initially believed that the charge was stored in the water in early Leyden jars. In the 1700s American statesman and scientist [[Benjamin Franklin]] performed extensive investigations of both water-filled and foil Leyden jars, which led him to conclude that the charge was stored in the glass, not in the water. A popular experiment, due to Franklin, which seems to demonstrate this involves taking a jar apart after it has been charged and showing that little charge can be found on the metal plates, and therefore it must be in the [[dielectric]].  The first documented instance of this demonstration is in a 1749 letter by Franklin.<ref>Letter IV: Benjamin Franklin to Peter Collinson, April 29, 1749 (Bigelow vol II p. 237-253) [http://www.compadre.org/precollege/items/Load.cfm?ID=3430 (PDF containing extracts)]</ref>  Franklin designed a "dissectible" Leyden jar ''(right)'', which was widely used in demonstrations. The jar is constructed out of a glass cup nested between two fairly snugly fitting metal cups. When the jar is charged with a high voltage and carefully dismantled, it is discovered that all the parts may be freely handled without discharging the jar. If the pieces are re-assembled, a large [[electric spark|spark]] may still be obtained from it.

This demonstration appears to suggest that [[capacitor]]s store their charge inside their dielectric. This theory was taught throughout the 1800s. However, this phenomenon is a special effect caused by the high voltage on the Leyden jar.<ref name="Mills">{{cite journal | last = Mills | first = Allan | authorlink =  | title = Part 6: The Leyden jar and other capacitors | journal = Bulletin of the Scientific Instrument Society | volume =  | issue = 99 | pages = 20–22 | date = December 2008 | url = http://www.sis.org.uk/bulletin/99/mills.pdf | issn =  | doi =  | id =  | accessdate = 2010-06-13 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110727024546/http://www.sis.org.uk/bulletin/99/mills.pdf | archivedate = 2011-07-27 | df =  }}</ref> In the dissectible Leyden jar, charge is transferred to the surface of the glass cup by [[corona discharge]] when the jar is disassembled; this is the source of the residual charge after the jar is reassembled. Handling the cup while disassembled does not provide enough contact to remove all the surface charge. [[Soda glass]] is [[hygroscopic]] and forms a partially conductive coating on its surface, which holds the charge.<ref name="Mills" /> Addenbrooke (1922) found that in a dissectible jar made of paraffin wax, or glass baked to remove moisture, the charge remained on the metal plates.<ref>{{cite journal | last = Addenbrooke | first = G.

==Quantity of charge==
Originally, the amount of [[capacitance]] was measured in number of '[[jar (unit)|jars]]' of a given size, or through the total coated area, assuming reasonably standard thickness and composition of the glass. A typical Leyden jar of one [[pint]] size has a capacitance of about 1 [[farad|nF]].

== Residual charge ==
If a charged Leyden jar is discharged by shorting the inner and outer coatings and left to sit for a few minutes, the jar will recover some of its previous charge, and a second spark can be obtained from it.<ref>{{cite EB1911| wstitle = Electrostatics | volume = 9 | page = 246  |first=John Ambrose |last=Fleming}}</ref> Often this can be repeated, and a series of 4 or 5 sparks, decreasing in length, can be obtained at intervals. This effect is caused by [[dielectric absorption]].<ref>{{cite book | last = Graf | first = Rudolf F. | authorlink = | title = Modern dictionary of electronics, 7th Ed. | publisher = [[Newnes]] | year = 1999 | location = | pages = 192 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=uah1PkxWeKYC&pg=PA192 | doi = | id = | isbn = 978-0-7506-9866-5}}</ref>
