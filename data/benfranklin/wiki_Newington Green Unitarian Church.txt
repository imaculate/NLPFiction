'''Newington Green Unitarian Church (NGUC)''' in [[north London]] is one of England's oldest [[Unitarianism|Unitarian]] churches. It has had strong ties to political radicalism for over 300 years, and is London's oldest [[Nonconformist]] place of worship still in use. It was founded in 1708 by [[English Dissenters]], a community of which had been gathering around [[Newington Green]] for at least half a century before that date. The church belongs to the [[umbrella organisation]] known as the [[General Assembly of Unitarian and Free Christian Churches]], and has had an upturn in its fortunes since the turn of the millennium.

Its most famous minister was Dr [[Richard Price]], a political radical who is remembered for his role in the [[Revolution Controversy]], a British debate about the [[French Revolution]], but who also did pioneering work in finance and statistics.  The most famous member of its congregation was [[Mary Wollstonecraft]], who drew inspiration from Price's sermons in her work, both in [[A Vindication of the Rights of Men|arguing for the new French republic]] and in [[A Vindication of the Rights of Woman|raising the issue of the rights of women]].

The building, which faces the north side of [[village green|the green]], was extended in 1860, and was [[listed building|listed]] in 1953. It lies within the [[London Borough of Hackney]], although the rest of the green is part of the [[London Borough of Islington]].

==Background to its creation==
After the end of [[Oliver Cromwell]]'s [[Commonwealth of England|Commonwealth]] and the [[English Restoration|Restoration]] of [[Charles II of England|Charles II]], those in England and Wales who were not members of the [[Church of England]] found themselves in an uncomfortable position. Several pieces of legislation, known collectively as the [[Clarendon Code]], made their lives difficult.  [[Corporation Act 1661|The first]] restricted public office to Anglicans.  The [[Act of Uniformity 1662|Act of Uniformity]] the following year was a step too far for many clergymen, and about 2,000 of them left the [[established church]] in the [[Great Ejection]] of 1662.  [[Conventicle Act 1664|The third act]] forbad unauthorised religious meetings of more than five people.  [[Five Mile Act 1665|The final one]] prohibited Nonconformist clergymen from living within five miles of a parish from which they had been banned.  Where the ministers went, their flocks tended to follow.<ref>page 4. {{cite book | last = Thorncroft | first = Michael | title = Trust in Freedom: The Story of Newington Green Unitarian Church 1708–1958 | publisher = Private publication for the trustees of the church | year = 1958 | location = London | pages = 35}}</ref> Some of these restrictions were ameliorated a generation later, with the passing of the [[Act of Toleration 1689]], which guaranteed [[freedom of worship]] for certain groups. It allowed Nonconformists (or [[Dissenters]]) their own places of worship and their own teachers and preachers, subject to certain oaths of allegiance and to the registering of these locations and leaders, but it perpetuated their existing social and political disabilities, including their exclusion from political office and also from universities ([[Oxford University|Oxford]] and [[Cambridge University|Cambridge]] were the only universities in England and Wales at that time).

[[Roman Catholic]]s were specifically targeted by these acts, and many of them [[Recusancy|went underground]]. Some Christians who had hoped for a more [[Protestant Reformation]] within the [[Established Church]] chose to emigrate, especially to the American colonies, as the [[Pilgrim Fathers]] had done in 1620.  Others maintained their faith openly, and lived with the restrictions the state placed upon them, moving to areas where they were tolerated. Often they set up educational establishments, known in general as [[dissenting academies]], which were intellectually and morally more rigorous than the universities.<ref>Thorncroft p5</ref> One such was at [[Newington Green]], then an agricultural village a few miles from London, but now within [[Inner London]]. Unitarianism or Rational Dissent&nbsp;– "that intellectual aristocracy in the ranks of Dissent, as historians often characterise it"&nbsp;– had an obvious affinity with education, critical enquiry, and challenges to the ''status quo'', and is "one of the roots of modern English Culture".<ref>[https://www.theguardian.com/books/2003/apr/05/society.history "Spirit of the Age"] by Tom Paulin. 5 April 2003 ''[[The Guardian]]''</ref> A critical mass of such people, including "dissident intellectuals, pedagogues with reforming ideas and Dissenters"<ref>{{cite book | last = Tomalin | first = Claire | title = The Life and Death of Mary Wollstonecraft (rev. ed. 1992)|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QaIOAQAAMAAJ| publisher = Penguin Books | location = London | page =46}}</ref><ref>{{cite book | last = Jacobs | first = Diane | title = Her Own Woman: The Life of Mary Wollstonecraft | publisher = Simon & Schuster | year = 2001 | location = London | pages = 334.

Not all of these free-thinkers were Unitarians, such as Quaker [[John Coakley Lettsome]] (physician, philanthropist, and [[Abolitionism in the United Kingdom|abolitionist]]) or the Anglicans [[Vicesimus Knox]] (pacifist and writer) and [[George Gaskin]] (minister and long-time secretary of the [[Society for Promoting Christian Knowledge]]), but most had some connections to the chapel on the green.

==The building and its religious neighbours==

The original building of 1708 was financed with £300 from Edward Harrison, a goldsmith, {{Inflation|UK|300|1708|fmt=eq|cursign=£}}.{{Inflation-fn|UK|df=y}} He leased it to the trustees of the congregation, who furnished it with pulpit, pews, and so on, raising the necessary £96 from about 20&nbsp;subscribers, primarily by hiring or selling pews.<ref name="Thorncroft, p8">Thorncroft, p8</ref> It was a "substantial brick building, of nearly square form, with the high, tiled, projecting roof, common at its era",<ref>''History and Topoography of the Parish of St Mary, Islington'' by Samuel Lewis, 1842, cited in Allardyce, p9.</ref> "Historic views show that the original façade had a small pediment against a large hipped roof, with a central oval window below."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hackney.gov.uk/ep-newington-green-church.htm |title=Hackney - Archives and local history |publisher= |accessdate=29 June 2016 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304053927/http://www.hackney.gov.uk/ep-newington-green-church.htm |archivedate=4 March 2016 |df= }}</ref> It was too plain for Wollstonecraft's Anglican tastes,<ref name="Gordon, p42">Gordon, p42.</ref> and one of her biographers thought it defiantly stark.<ref>Jacobs, p38-39.</ref> This building was substantially extended and improved in the mid-nineteenth century. An internal gallery was built to increase the seating available, and a few years later the roof and [[apse]] were renewed, and a "[[stucco]]ed frontage" was built, "mirroring the original façade with a three-bay front with two round-headed windows, but with added Tuscan [[pilaster]]s and a large [[pediment]]".<ref>Allardyce, p35.</ref> In the mid-twentieth century, the building was damaged by enemy action.

Other religious institutions existed nearby. [[St Matthias Church (Stoke Newington)|St Matthias]], one of London's foremost [[High Church]]es, was built a couple of hundred yards away between 1849 and 1853, partly with money from a rich doctor named Robert Brett,<ref name="Allardyce, p33">Allardyce, p33.</ref> who thought that the Dissenting chapels were attracting so many worshippers in part because the Anglican pews were full.<ref name=SNC>'Stoke Newington: Churches', [http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=4732 ''A History of the County of Middlesex'']: Volume 8: Islington and Stoke Newington parishes (1985), pp. 204–211.  Accessed 29 May 2009.</ref>  Jews fleeing the [[pogrom]]s of the [[Russian Empire]] established a congregation in the area by 1876, and built the [[Dalston Synagogue]] in adjoining Poets Road in 1885.

Newington Green fell within the old [[Stoke Newington (parish)|parish boundaries of Stoke Newington]]. Although the latter village, centred on [[Stoke Newington Church Street|Church Street]], was a mile away from the hamlet of the Green, across farmland or along the ancient [[drovers' road]] of [[Green Lanes (London)|Green Lanes]], the two places had and still have a close connection. From the mid-1640s to the mid-1650s, [[Stoke Newington]]'s [[parish church]] was led by [[Thomas Manton]], "a principal person among the non-conformist ministers",;<ref>Robinson, p141.</ref> a staunch and popular defender of [[Reformed churches|Reformed principles]], he participated in the [[Westminster Assembly]], acted as chaplain to [[Oliver Cromwell]], and preached before [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament]] on several occasions. Another Dissenting [[meeting house]] was built in Stoke Newington about 1700, near the house of [[Mary Abney]], who had inherited the manor.<ref>{{cite book|last=Robinson|first=William|title=The history and antiquities of the parish of Stoke Newington in the county of Middlesex: containing an account of the prebendal manor, the church, charities, schools, meeting houses, &c., with appendices|publisher=J.B.

As the NGUC lacks its own cemetery, some of its congregants, such as the poet and banker [[Samuel Rogers]], are buried in St Mary's churchyard. However, as the [[Church of England]] normally limits its cemeteries to its members, most of the Newington Green Unitarians opted for [[Bunhill Fields]] until the middle of the nineteenth century, and then [[Abney Park Cemetery]] thereafter.  ([[Robert Southey]] called the former the [[Camposanto Monumentale|Campo Santo]] of the Dissenters, but the phrase was used for both.)  Wollstonecraft was married and later buried at [[St Pancras Old Church]] a few miles away.

==Earliest years: to the mid-eighteenth century==
Newington Green Unitarian Church has been associated with many historically significant people on both sides of the pulpit, especially but not exclusively in the eighteenth century.  [[Charles Morton (educator)|Charles Morton]] (1626–1698), the great educator who ended his career as vice-president of [[Harvard University]], ran an influential [[Dissenting academies|Dissenting Academy]], "probably on the site of the current Unitarian church".<ref>Allardyce, p7.</ref>  One of his friends, James Ashurst, founded a group that worshipped in private houses licensed for the purpose, and, in time, this small congregation decided to build a proper meeting house.<ref name="Thorncroft, p8"/> (It is worth mentioning here the early religious evolution of this church. It started as [[Presbyterian]], with views on the [[Trinity]] as orthodox as those held by the Church of England. In fact, several of its first [[Minister (Christianity)|ministers]] chose to conform, i.e. rejoin, the established church:<ref>Thorncroft, ch.3 "The Early Years: 1714–1758"</ref> one of these was [[Richard Biscoe]], who gave the [[Boyle Lectures]] in the late 1730s. However, NGUC soon acquired ministers who were [[Arian]], that is, who [[Nontrinitarianism|denied the Trinity]], although they retained their belief in the divinity of [[Jesus Christ]].<ref>Thorncroft, p11</ref> Thus was the [[Unitarianism|Unitarian]] nature of the church created. In the mid-nineteenth century it was described by a local historian as a [[Socinianism|Socinian]] Independent meeting house.<ref>Robinson, p210.</ref>)  The author [[Daniel Defoe]], who attended school at Newington Green, is believed to have attended the church.<ref>"Defoe in Stoke Newington".

==Later eighteenth century: the voices heard round the world==

===Richard Price===
[[File:Dr Richard Price, DD, FRS - Benjamin West.jpg|thumb|right|[[Richard Price]]]]
The minister whose name is still remembered centuries later is Dr [[Richard Price]], a libertarian and republican who cemented the village's "reputation as a centre for radical thinkers and social reformers".<ref>Allardyce, p18.</ref> He arrived in 1758 with his wife Sarah, and took up residence in No. 54 the Green, in the middle of a terrace even then a hundred years old. (The building still survives as London's oldest brick [[Terraced house|terrace]], dated 1658.) In that house, or the church itself, he was visited by [[Founding Fathers of the United States]] such as [[Benjamin Franklin]], [[Thomas Jefferson]], and [[Thomas Paine]]; other American politicians such as [[John Adams]], who later became the second [[president of the United States]], and his wife [[Abigail Adams|Abigail]]; British politicians such as [[George Lyttelton, 1st Baron Lyttelton|Lord Lyttleton]], [[William Petty, 2nd Earl of Shelburne|the Earl of Shelburne]], [[Earl Stanhope]] (known as "Citizen Stanhope"), and even the [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]] [[William Pitt, 1st Earl of Chatham|William Pitt]]; philosophers [[David Hume]] and [[Adam Smith]]; agitators such as prison reformer [[John Howard (prison reformer)|John Howard]], gadfly [[John Horne Tooke]], and husband and wife [[John Jebb (1736–1786)|John]] and [[Ann Jebb]], who between them campaigned on [[Suffrage#Forms of exclusion from suffrage|expansion of the franchise]], opposition to the [[American Revolutionary War|war with America]], support for the [[French Revolution]], [[Abolitionism in the United Kingdom|abolitionism]], and [[Catholic Emancipation|an end to legal discrimination against Roman Catholics]]; writers such as poet and banker [[Samuel Rogers]];<ref name="Thorncroft, p15">Thorncroft, p15.</ref> and clergyman-mathematician [[Thomas Bayes]], known for [[Bayes' theorem]].

Price was fortunate in forming close friendships among his neighbours and congregants. One was Thomas Rogers, father of the above, a merchant turned banker who had married into a long-established Dissenting family and lived at No. 56 the Green. More than once, Price and the elder Rogers rode on horseback to Wales.<ref name="Thorncroft, p15"/> Another was the Rev. [[James Burgh]], author of ''The Dignity of Human Nature'' and ''Thoughts on Education'', who opened his Dissenting Academy on the green in 1750 and sent his pupils to Price's sermons.<ref name="Gordon, p42"/> Price, Rogers, and Burgh formed a dining club, eating at each other's houses in rotation.<ref>Allardyce, p23.</ref>  When in 1770 Price became morning preacher at the [[Gravel Pit Chapel]] in [[Homerton]], he continued his afternoon sermons at NGUC.

[[File:Newington green terrace 1.jpg|thumb|left|52–55 Newington Green, including the houses of Price and Rogers. This is the oldest brick terrace in London.]]

There were many at a distance who acknowledged their debt to Price, such as the Unitarian theologians [[William Ellery Channing]] and [[Theophilus Lindsey]], and the formidable [[polymath]] and Dissenting clergyman, [[Joseph Priestley]], discoverer of oxygen.  When [[Joseph Priestley and Dissent|Priestley's support of dissent]] led to the [[Priestley Riots|riots named after him]], he fled [[Birmingham]] and headed for the sanctuary of Newington Green, where Rogers took him in.

The support Price gave to the revolt of the colonies of [[British North America]], arguing that the [[American Revolution]] was justified, made his name as a famous or notorious preacher. He rejected traditional Christian notions of [[original sin]] and moral punishment, preaching the perfectibility of human nature,<ref>Gordon, p50.</ref> and he wrote on theological questions. However, his interests were wide-ranging, and during the decades Price spent as minister of NGUC, he also wrote on finance, economics, probability, and life insurance, being inducted into the [[Royal Society]] in recognition of his work.  On the 101st anniversary of the [[Glorious Revolution]], he preached a sermon titled "[[A Discourse on the Love of Our Country]]", thus igniting a so-called "pamphlet war" known as the [[Revolution Controversy]], furiously debating the issues raised by the [[French Revolution]]. Burke's rebuttal "[[Reflections on the Revolution in France]]" attacked Price, whose friends Paine and Wollstonecraft leapt into the fray to defend their mentor. The reputation of Price for speaking without fear of the government on these political and philosophical matters drew huge crowds to the church, and were published and sold as [[pamphleteer|pamphlets]] (i.e. publications easily printed and circulated).

===Mary Wollstonecraft===
[[File:Mary Wollstonecraft by John Opie (c. 1797).jpg|right|thumb|[[Mary Wollstonecraft]] (c. 1797)]]
Arguably the congregant Price most influenced was the early feminist [[Mary Wollstonecraft]], who moved her fledgling school for girls from Islington to the Green in 1784, with the help of a "[[fairy godmother]]"<ref>Gordon, p40.</ref> whose good auspices found her a house to rent and twenty students to fill it.<ref>Jacobs, p38.</ref>  Her patron — or matron — was the well-off Mrs Burgh, widow of the educationalist, who treated her almost as a daughter.<ref>Gordon, p46.</ref> The new arrival attended services at NGUC: she was a lifelong Anglican, but, in keeping with the church's and Price's ethos of logical enquiry and individual conscience, believers of all kinds were welcomed without any expectation of conversion.<ref name="Tomalin, p60">Tomalin, p60.</ref> The approach of these Rational Dissenters appealed to Wollstonecraft: they were hard-working, humane, critical but uncynical, and respectful towards women,<ref>Tomalin, p51.</ref> and in her hour of need proved kinder to her than her own family.<ref name="Tomalin, p60"/>  She, an unmarried woman making her own way in the world, was marginal to the dominant society in just the same way that the Dissenters were.<ref>Gordon, p48.</ref>

Wollstonecraft was then a young schoolmistress, as yet unpublished, but Price saw something in her worth fostering, and became a friend and mentor. Through the minister (and through the young Anglican [[John Hewlett]],<ref>Jacobs, p45.</ref> who also introduced her to the eminent lexicographer [[Samuel Johnson]]<ref>Tomalin, p50 and 57</ref>), she met the great humanitarian and radical publisher [[Joseph Johnson (publisher)|Joseph Johnson]], who was to guide her career and serve as a father figure.  Through him, with a title alluding to the husband of her other benefactor, she published ''[[Thoughts on the Education of Daughters]]'' (subtitled: ''with reflections on female conduct, in the more important duties of life''). The ideas Wollstonecraft ingested from the sermons at NGUC pushed her towards a political awakening.<ref>Gordon, p51 passim.</ref> A couple of years after she had had to leave Newington Green, these seeds germinated into ''[[A Vindication of the Rights of Men]]'', a response to Burke's denunciation of the French Revolution and attack on Price. In 1792 she published the work for which she is best remembered, ''[[A Vindication of the Rights of Woman]]'', in the spirit of rationalism extending Price's arguments about equality to women: Her biographer [[Claire Tomalin]] argues that just as the Dissenters were "excluded as a class from education and civil rights by a lazy-minded majority", so too were women, and the "character defects of both groups" could be attributed to this discrimination.<ref>Tomalin, p61.</ref>

===Joseph Towers===
{{main|Joseph Towers}}
It would have been hard for anyone to step into the shoes of Dr Price, but the minister from 1778 to his death in 1799 was a remarkable character in his own right. [[Joseph Towers]] was born in about 1738, the son of a poor bookseller, and was apprenticed as a printer to [[Robert Goadby]] of [[Sherborne]].  Lacking formal education, he read all he could and educated himself, eventually writing learned works such as ''Criminal Libel and the Duty of Juries'', and being awarded a Doctor of Law degree by [[Edinburgh University]]. Towers assisted fellow minister [[Andrew Kippis]] in developing the ''Biographia Britannica'', a forerunner of the ''[[Dictionary of National Biography]]''.  He was secretary of the highly respectable [[Society for Constitutional Information]], which lobbied for political liberties, but it was suppressed by the authorities, who lived in fear of the [[Reign of Terror]] crossing the Channel. Towers was put under arrest until the [[Archbishop of Canterbury]] intervened on his behalf.<ref>Thorncroft, p17-18</ref>

==Early nineteenth century: The Barbaulds==
[[File:Clissold park new river 1.jpg|thumb|The [[New River (England)|New River]] in [[Clissold Park]].]]
In 1808, Rochemont Barbauld was appointed minister, first as the morning preacher. His wife, [[Anna Laetitia Barbauld]] (1743–1825), was a prolific writer, admired by [[Samuel Johnson]] and [[William Wordsworth]].<ref>Thorncroft, p19</ref>  She enjoyed a long friendship with [[Joseph Priestley]] and [[William Enfield]], starting from their years together at the [[Warrington Academy]] in the 1760s, where her father [[John Aikin (Unitarian)|John Aikin]] was tutor.  She wrote poems (including a tribute to Priestley), hymns, [[children's literature]], and political and religious tracts. She was an abolitionist, addressing one of her works to [[William Wilberforce]]. 1793 saw her contribution to the Pamphlet War, "Sins of the Government, Sins of the Nation". Two years later she wrote ''The Rights of Women'', but this was not published until her death thirty years later.

Rochemont eventually went violently insane, attacked his wife, and committed suicide by drowning himself in the [[New River (England)|New River]] that runs through Islington. Anna remained a member of the congregation until her death and is commemorated in the church with a plaque which praises her work for "the Cause of Humanity, Peace, and Justice, [and] of Civil and Religious Liberty".  Her brother Dr [[John Aikin]] lived nearby, and together they co-authored books such as ''[[Evenings at Home]]''. As he had been a Unitarian minister in his youth, it is likely that he worshipped at NGUC, with [[Arthur Aikin|his son Arthur]], a prominent scientist, and [[Lucy Aikin|his daughter Lucy]], a biographer.  They lived in a house previously occupied by [[Adam Anderson (economist)|Adam Anderson]], clerk to the [[South Sea Company]].<ref>Robinson, p91-92.</ref>

==Early nineteenth century: legal acceptance==
[[Thomas Rees (Unitarian minister)|Thomas Rees]] took over after Barbauld's death. He was a leading authority of the [[history of Unitarianism]], and made connections with the [[Unitarian Church of Transylvania]]. In 1813 two things occurred, key to the understanding of the development of the church: Parliament passed the [[Doctrine of the Trinity Act 1813|Doctrine of the Trinity Act]], and Rees was succeeded by James Gilchrist, who remained for 15 years. ([[Alexander Gilchrist|His son Alexander]] wrote [[Life of Blake|the standard biography]] of poet and artist [[William Blake]].)  The larger public event meant that the civil and religious liberties that Dissenters had been fighting for were won, the battle of a century and a half was over. The more particular event sowed its own seeds of destruction, as Gilchrist gradually changed his opinions and eventually wrote a pamphlet called "Unitarianism Abandoned", which infuriated his very Unitarian congregation. For a long time he refused to resign, but in the end he was forced out, and the church built a safeguard against such a future occurrence by holding annual elections for the minister. NGUC then entered a very low ebb, with at one point as few as nine subscribers and a rapid turnover of ministers.  The causes it had agitated for had been successful, and the church looked backwards with pride, but saw little to look forward to. Energy drained away. "Legal recognition did not prosper the cause of the church, however, which at this time began to decline."<ref>Thorncroft, p20 and throughout ch 5, "New Causes for Old".</ref>

==Mid-nineteenth century: social challenges==
"New causes and fresh ideals were needed to revitalise the church, and, fortunately, they were forthcoming." The nature of Newington Green had changed—the fresh bucolic village had been swallowed up by London's relentless growth, and had become a "thriving and expanding suburb".<ref>Thorncroft, p20.</ref> With this growth of prosperity also came a tide of poverty,<ref name="Allardyce, p33"/> and this was to prove the [[Religious ministry (Christian)|mission]] for the [[Victorian era]].  A hundred years before, the ethos had been one of almost [[Puritan]] self-reliance, but now the [[Dickens]]ian poverty, evident in cholera epidemics and rampant malnutrition, made social responsibility an urgent necessity.<ref>Thorncroft, p2-23.</ref>  The minister who guided the first 25 years of this (1839–64) was [[Thomas Cromwell (antiquary)|Thomas Cromwell]], [[Society of Antiquaries of London|FSA]] (1792–1870). (Like many Anglican vicars,<ref>cf [[William Bedwell]] (1561–1632), nearby Vicar of Tottenham, and W.A. Diggens, Vicar of [[St Keverne]], Cornwall 1896–1913 [http://www.st-keverne.com/History/Diggens/index.html Index]</ref> one of his hobbies was [[local history]].)

A charity school for 14 girls and a [[Monitorial System|monitorial]] Sunday school for 150 children had been set up in the vicinity by Dissenters in 1790 and 1808 respectively, but these efforts were augmented in the middle of the century.<ref>Robinson, p209.</ref> In 1840, a [[Sunday school]] was set up for poor children, and soon thereafter a Domestic Mission Society, to visit the poor in their homes.  A library and a savings club emphasised self-help.  A regular day school ran from 1860 for ten years, until primary education became the responsibility of the state with the passing of the [[Elementary Education Act 1870]].

One of the first actions of Cromwell's tenure, in terms of changing the church services, was to introduce the hymnbook of [[James Martineau]]. [[Samuel Sharpe (scholar)|Samuel Sharpe]], named after his uncle, the poet [[Samuel Rogers]], came to Newington Green in 1828, and maintained his connection for 30 years, including as trustee.  He was an erudite and generous man, a banker by day and an Egyptologist and Bible translator in his leisure hours.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Clayden|first1=PW|title=Samuel Sharpe|page=82|url=https://archive.org/stream/cu31924026852180/cu31924026852180_djvu.txt|accessdate=7 May 2016}}</ref> In 1870 he was elected Chairman of the British and Foreign Unitarian Society. [[Andrew Pritchard]] (1804–1882) was treasurer of NGUC 1850–73, during which time donations doubled.  He was a microscope and slide maker who made significant [[History of optics|improvements to microscopy]] and studied microscopic organisms; he was a friend of [[Michael Faraday]] and for him, [[Relationship between religion and science|science and religion]] were one. He led the Newington Green Conversation Society, membership restricted to 16, a successor to the Mutual Instruction Society.<ref>Thorncroft, p23-24.</ref> The "small but energetic community" continued to campaign on the larger political stage, presenting petitions to Parliament on subjects touching religious matters, such as the [[Dissenting Chapels Bill]] (made law as Nonconformists Chapels Act 1844), [[Emancipation of the Jews in England|the removal of civil disabilities from the Jews]] (1847), permission for Dissenters to attend Oxford and Cambridge Universities, and the revision of the [[King James Bible]].<ref>Thorncroft, p25.</ref> Religious freedom and self-improvement were their watchwords.

==Later nineteenth century: towards the high water==
NGUC thrived during the last decades of the nineteenth century, and its congregation grew to 80&nbsp;subscribers. The London Sunday School Society recognised the one at NGUC as the best in its class, educating up to 200&nbsp;children and necessitating the construction in 1887 of the schoolhouse immediately behind the main church building.  A range of groups sprung up, ranging from intellectual (a Society for Mutual Theological Study) to recreational (cycling and cricket). Young Men's and Young Women's groups met, as did the Mothers' Meeting, a [[Industrial and Provident Society|Provident Society]], and [[teetotalism]] (abstinence from alcohol) support [[Temperance movement|for adults]] [[Hope UK|and children]]. Other issues of concern were education, social reform, and [[women's suffrage]].

Sister and brother Marian and Ion Pritchard continued the work of their father. The cause of [[liberal religion]] in general, and the development of the [[General Assembly of Unitarian and Free Christian Churches]], were overarching themes. Marian in particular is described as an unsung heroine, and "one of the leaders of modern Unitarianism". She set up Oxford Summer Schools for the training of Sunday School teachers, and Winifred House Invalid Children's Convalescent Home.<ref>Thorncroft, p28, and throughout ch7 "The Lights Go Out".</ref>

==Early twentieth century: wars and crises==
Thorncroft, author of the church's semiquincentennial history, ''Trust in Freedom'', concludes that NGUC reached its high-water mark at its bicentenary in 1908.  Immediately after this, NGUC suffered a religious schism in miniature, when the incoming minister, Dr F. W. G. Foat, backed the New Theology of [[Reginald John Campbell]] and the League of Progressive Thought and Service.  This [[Social Gospel]] movement was not to the taste of all his congregants, and Foat left for the Richmond Free Christian Church. Then came 1914, and 
Christian faith all over the world was shaken by the horrors of World War I. Unitarians as a body have never been pacifists, unlike the [[Quakers]], and some fifteen members of the congregation and Sunday School fell during the war.  Society as a whole found less solace in religion, perhaps particularly liberal religion, with its message of human dignity ringing hollow beside the great guns. Meanwhile, many of the older people with long family ties to Newington Green simply died. The professional middle class had largely left the area. Numbers in the pews dropped. By 1930 "it was whispered that the church could not survive".<ref>Thorncroft, p31.</ref>

Nonetheless, survive it did. One influential supporter was an alderman and councillor in the Borough of Stoke Newington, and in 1938 a new lay pastor and his family breathed new life into the church. Although attendance at services was low, other activities drew in crowds: 100 to the temperance meetings, for example.  The outbreak of World War II meant that children were evacuated temporarily from London, so the Sunday Schools and Young People's Leagues ceased for a time. The Sunday services never missed a week, however, even when the building was badly damaged by a landmine blast: they just moved to the schoolhouse.  After the war, the ministry focused on building bridges between races and faiths, e.g. with the Jewish community of North London, and was recognised by the World Congress of Faiths, an organisation founded by [[Francis Younghusband]]. Services were often attended by local politicians, including the Mayor of Stoke Newington. Leaders for the [[General Assembly of Unitarian and Free Christian Churches|national Unitarian movement]] continued to be found within the congregation at Newington Green.<ref>Thorncroft, p32-33.</ref>

==Later twentieth century/early twenty-first century: rejuvenation==
[[File:London anti-war protest banners.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Protesters filled London's streets]]
In the late twentieth century, faced with declining numbers, Newington Green Unitarian Church developed closer ties with Islington Unitarian Church a couple of km away. They started to share a minister and publicise events together under the name New Unity, while remaining legally distinct entities. The 1969 sale of the (New) [[Gravel Pit Chapel]] near the centre of  [[Hackney Central|the historic village of Hackney]] released funding via the [[Charity Commission]] for maintenance of the Newington Green chapel.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=22714 |title=Hackney: Protestant Nonconformity |author=T.F.T.

By the turn of the millennium, NGUC's community was reduced in numbers.

===Richard Price Memorial Lecture===
Courtney revived the Richard Price Memorial Lecture, which had last been given in 1981.<ref name=MacWilliam/> NGUC now sponsors it annually, to address "a topical or important aspect of liberty, reason and ethics".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lecturelist.org/content/view_lecture/5819|title="Dishonesty" Evan Davis|publisher=|accessdate=29 June 2016}}</ref> In September 2003 the first of the new series took place under the auspices of the Stoke Newington Unitarian Conference, where Barbara Taylor, author of ''Mary Wollstonecraft and the Feminist Imagination'', spoke on "Radical Dissent and Women's Rights in Eighteenth-Century Britain".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.uel.ac.uk/ssmcs/staff/barbara_taylor/|title=University of East London - UEL - University of East London|publisher=|accessdate=29 June 2016|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20070502194127/http://www.uel.ac.uk/ssmcs/staff/barbara_taylor/|archivedate=2 May 2007|df=dmy-all}}</ref> In 2005 [[Will Self]] addressed the need to [[disestablishmentarianism|disestablish]] the Church of England <ref>[https://www.independent.co.uk/opinion/commentators/will-self-the-soggy-wafer-of-meekness-is-backed-up-by-air-strikes-517218.html "The soggy wafer of meekness is backed up by air strikes"] 28 November 2005 ''[[The Independent]]''</ref> under the title "Why Religion Needs Satire".

===Stance on gay marriage===
In March 2008, Newington Green Unitarian Church became the first religious establishment in Britain to refuse to carry out any weddings at all until all couples have [[same-sex marriage|equal marriage rights]].<ref>[http://www.newingtongreen-nowandthen.org.uk/img/studentwork/magazine/nowandthenmag.pdf "Radicalism and Richard Price" by Rhasan Brunner, in ''Newington Green Now and Then: N16 magazine'', December 2008]{{dead link|date=February 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> Unity Church Islington followed suit a couple of months later.

The church's decision was in response to the case brought by the [[Christian Institute]], backing the claim of Lillian Ladele, a [[Registrar General|registrar]] employed by [[Islington London Borough Council]] who wished to be exempted from having to perform [[civil partnership]] ceremonies on the grounds of her religion.<ref name=Evans>[https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/belief/2009/mar/16/religion-unitarian "Strength in Unity?"] by Judith Evans. 19 March 2009 ''[[The Guardian]]''</ref> The move was praised by Rev.

===Tercentenary celebrations===
NGUC celebrated its tercentenary in 2008 under the slogan "300 years of dissent", marking this with events such as planting a [[crab apple]] tree,<ref>[http://www.newingtongreen.org.uk/image/planting-unitarian-churchs-tree 25 Feb 2009 Newington Green Action Group] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120224055737/http://newingtongreen.org.uk/image/planting-unitarian-churchs-tree |date=24 February 2012 }}</ref> organising a picnic in conjunction with the Newington Green Action Group, and hosting a concert of [[Ottoman classical music]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.new-unity.org/#/tercentenary/4525765558|title=Home|publisher=|accessdate=29 June 2016}}</ref> (There is a strong [[Turkish community of London|Turkish community]] in Newington Green and along the nearest section of [[Green Lanes (London)|Green Lanes]], an ancient road which starts from the northwest corner of the Green.)

===250th anniversary of Wollstonecraft's birth===
The following year it commemorated the 250th anniversary of the birth of Mary Wollstonecraft,<ref>[http://www.thecnj.com/islington/2009/041709/inews041709_11.html "Festival for ‘first feminist’"] by Peter Gruner, 17&nbsp;April 2009, ''Islington Tribune''</ref> attaching a large banner to the railings outside the building, proclaiming it the "birthplace of feminism", in a nod to the formative years that she spent worshipping there.<ref name=Evans/> NGUC sponsored a series of events,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.new-unity.org/#/mary-wollstonecraft/4533317582|title=Home|publisher=|accessdate=29 June 2016}}</ref> including a return visit and lecture by biographer [[Barbara Taylor]]; a panel discussion about women and power, between female politicians [[Diane Abbott]] MP, [[Jean Lambert]] MEP, and [[Emily Thornberry]] MP;<ref>[https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2009/may/19/emily-thornberry-islington-mps-expenses "Right, so just what do you do all day?"] by Aida Edemariam, 19 May 2009 ''[[The Guardian]]''</ref> an art exhibition titled Mother of Feminism; a concert featuring [[Carol Grimes]] and Adey Grummet, to raise money for [[Stop the Traffik]], an [[Human trafficking|anti-trafficking]] charity; a tombstone tribute at [[St Pancras Old Church]]; a birthday cake baked by men; and other activities.<ref>"Birthplace of Feminism" by Guy Bentham, in N16, issue 41, spring 2009</ref>

Pakula's sermon in honour of the Wollstonecraft anniversary stressed her role as a prophet. This excerpt serves as a flavour of the emphasis given to social action within the church:<ref>[http://www.new-unity.org/sermons-online/2009/prophetic-mary "Prophetic Mary" New Unity website. For 26 April 2009.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111002043431/http://www.new-unity.org/sermons-online/2009/prophetic-mary |date=2 October 2011 }}</ref> 
<blockquote>Mary Wollstonecraft was a unique individual&nbsp;– brilliant and strong. She was one who would not be swept along in stream of the common beliefs and understandings of her time. Hers was a keener sight&nbsp;– a vision that saw beyond what most people take for granted. She saw, contrary to the assumptions of her time, that women were the equals of men. Her bold stance&nbsp;– a position that proved to be many years ahead of her time&nbsp;– was met with broad condemnation. Today, we recognise that Mary Wollstonecraft spoke with the voice of prophesy.  We honour her for her courage and for the gifts she has given to future generations of women and men.</blockquote>

===Regular and occasional activities===
Services occur every Sunday at Newington Green Unitarian Church and include special events such as the yearly [[Flower Communion]]; twice-monthly poetry readings and weekly meditation sessions are also held at NGUC.  It participates in the annual festival of architecture, [[Open House London]]. It hosts occasional concerts, such as that given by the London Gallery Quire, which "performs [[west gallery music|West Gallery Music]], the [[Anglican chant|psalmody]] heard in [[parish church]]es and non-conformist chapels during the [[Georgian period]], from about 1720 to 1850",<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lgq.org.uk/|title=London Gallery Quire - Welcome|publisher=|accessdate=29 June 2016}}</ref><ref>[http://www.newingtongreen.org.uk/event/london-gallery-quire-concert-unitarian-church-20th-september 20 Sept 2008 Newington Green Action Group] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120224055752/http://newingtongreen.org.uk/event/london-gallery-quire-concert-unitarian-church-20th-september |date=24 February 2012 }}</ref> and the Psallite Women's Choir.<ref>[http://www.newingtongreen.org.uk/event/psallite-womens-choir-unitarian-church-4th-october 4 Oct 2008 Newington Green Action Group] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120224055805/http://newingtongreen.org.uk/event/psallite-womens-choir-unitarian-church-4th-october |date=24 February 2012 }}</ref> The congregation was reported to have grown to 70 as of 2009,<ref name="thecnj.com"/> with 30 at one Sunday service;<ref name="Islington News"/> it is one of the most rapidly growing Unitarian churches in Britain.<ref name="edition.pagesuite-professional.co.uk"/>
