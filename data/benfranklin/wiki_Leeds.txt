Leeds was a small manorial borough in the 13th century, and in the 17th and 18th centuries it became a major centre for the production and trading of wool, and in the [[Industrial Revolution]] a major [[mill town]]; wool was still the dominant industry, but [[flax]], engineering, iron [[Foundry|foundries]], printing, and other industries were also important.<ref>{{Harvnb|Burt and Grady|1994|p=92}}</ref> From being a market town in the valley of the [[River Aire]] in the 16th century, Leeds expanded and absorbed the surrounding villages to become a populous urban centre by the mid-20th century. It now lies within the [[West Yorkshire Urban Area]], the United Kingdom's fourth-most populous urban area, with a population of 2.6&nbsp;million.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nomisweb.co.uk/articles/747.aspx|title=2011 Census - Nomis - Official Labour Market Statistics|website=www.nomisweb.co.uk}}</ref>

Leeds has one of the most diverse economies of all the UK's main employment centres and has seen the fastest rate of private-sector jobs growth of any UK city. It also has the highest ratio of private to public sector jobs of all the UK's Core Cities, with 77% of its workforce working in the private sector. Leeds has the third-largest jobs total by local authority area, with 480,000 in employment and self-employment at the beginning of 2015.<ref name="leeds.gov.uk">{{cite web|url=http://www.leeds.gov.uk/Business/Pages/Leeds-economy.aspx|title=Leeds economy|publisher=|deadurl=yes|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170118082315/http://www.leeds.gov.uk/Business/Pages/Leeds-economy.aspx|archivedate=18 January 2017}}</ref> Leeds is ranked as a [[Global city#GaWC study|gamma world city]] by the [[Globalization and World Cities Research Network]].<ref name="TheWorld">{{cite web|url=http://www.lboro.ac.uk/gawc/world2010t.html |title=The World According to GaWC 2010 |accessdate=18 September 2011 |publisher=Globalization and World Cities Research Network. |deadurl=yes |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131010004859/http://www.lboro.ac.uk/gawc/world2010t.html |archivedate=10 October 2013  }}</ref> Leeds is the cultural, financial and commercial heart of the West Yorkshire Urban Area.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.planetware.com/england/leeds-eng-wy-lee.htm |title= Leeds Tourism |publisher=Planet Ware Travel Guide |accessdate=1 February 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.yorkshirepost.co.uk/businessnews/Leeds-stakes-its-claim-to.1864465.jp |title= Leeds stakes it claim to financial hub |work=The Yorkshire Post |accessdate=1 February 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bookinghome.com/en/United_Kingdom/England/Leeds-Hotels.html |title=About Leeds |publisher=www.bookinghime.com |accessdate=1 February 2009 |deadurl=yes |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080509134854/http://www.bookinghome.com/en/United_Kingdom/England/Leeds-Hotels.html |archivedate=9 May 2008  }}</ref> Leeds is served by four universities, and has the fourth largest student population in the country and the country's [[List of UK cities by GVA|fourth largest urban economy]].<ref name="BrookingsMetroEconomy">{{cite web |url=http://www.brookings.edu/research/interactives/global-metro-monitor-3 |title=Global MetroMonitor |accessdate=23 December 2013 |last1=Istrate |first1=Emilia |last2=Nadeau |first2=Carey Anne |date=November 2012 |place=Washington, DC |publisher=The Brookings Institution |deadurl=yes |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/6H7Jql2A9?url=http://www.brookings.edu/research/interactives/global-metro-monitor-3 |archivedate=4 June 2013  }}</ref>

Leeds developed as a [[market town]] in the [[Middle Ages]] as part of the local agricultural economy. Before the [[Industrial Revolution]], it became a co-ordination centre for the manufacture of woollen cloth, and white [[broadcloth]] was traded at its [[1st White Cloth Hall|White Cloth Hall]].<ref name=cloth>{{Cite journal|title=Houses as Museums: The Case of the Yorkshire Wool Textile Industry |journal=Transactions of the Royal Historical Society |first=S.A. |last=Caunce |pages=329–343 |year=2003 |volume=13 |publisher=Royal Historical Society|ref=harv}}</ref>

Leeds was a manor and township in the large ancient parish of ''Leeds St Peter'', in the [[Skyrack]] [[Hundred (county division)|wapentake]] of the [[West Riding of Yorkshire|West Riding]] of [[Yorkshire]].<ref name=vision_parish>{{cite web |title=Relationships / unit history of LEEDS |url=http://www.visionofbritain.org.uk/relationships.jsp?u_id%3D10443337 |deadurl=yes |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110814071837/http://www.visionofbritain.org.uk/relationships.jsp?u_id=10443337 |archivedate=14 August 2011  |accessdate=2 February 2017}}</ref> The Borough of Leeds was created in 1207, when Maurice Paynel, lord of the manor, granted a charter to a small area of the manor, close to the river crossing, in what is now the city centre. Four centuries later, the inhabitants petitioned [[Charles I of England|Charles I]] for a charter of incorporation, which was granted in 1626. The new charter incorporated the entire parish, including all eleven townships, as the [[County Borough of Leeds|Borough of Leeds]] and withdrew the earlier charter. [[Improvement commissioners]] were set up in 1755 for paving, lighting, and cleansing of the main streets, including [[Briggate, Leeds|Briggate]] and further powers were added in 1790 to improve the water supply.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.leodis.net/discovery/discovery.asp?page=2003218_676159084&topic=2003218_372249783&subsection=200342_125637234|title=Briggate: Improvement Acts |publisher=Leeds City Council |work=Discovering Leeds |accessdate=27 September 2009}}</ref>

[[File:Leeds Town Hall, General Election results.jpg|thumb|A crowd gathers outside Leeds Town Hall during the 1880 general elections.]]

The borough corporation was reformed under the provisions of [[Municipal Corporations Act 1835]]. [[Leeds City Police|Leeds Borough Police]] force was formed in 1836, and [[Leeds Town Hall]] was completed by the corporation in 1858. In 1866, Leeds and each of the other townships in the borough became [[civil parish]]s. The borough became a [[county borough]] in 1889, giving it independence from the newly formed West Riding County Council and it gained [[City status in the United Kingdom|city status]] in 1893. In 1904 the Leeds parish absorbed [[Beeston, Leeds|Beeston]], [[Chapel Allerton]], [[Farnley, West Yorkshire|Farnley]], [[Headingley cum Burley]] and [[Potternewton]] from within the borough. In the twentieth century the county borough initiated a series of significant territorial expansions, growing from {{convert|21593|acres|km2}} in 1911 to {{convert|40612|acres|km2}} in 1961.<ref name=vision_cb>{{cite web |url=http://www.visionofbritain.org.uk/relationships.jsp?u_id%3D10108809%26c_id%3D10001043 |map=http://www.visionofbritain.org.uk/boundary_map_page.jsp?u_id=10108809&c_id=10001043 |title=Leeds MB/CB |deadurl=yes |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120213031954/http://www.visionofbritain.org.uk/relationships.jsp?u_id=10108809&c_id=10001043 |archivedate=13 February 2012  |accessdate=2 February 2017}}</ref> In 1912 the parish and county borough of Leeds absorbed [[Leeds Rural District]], consisting of the parishes of [[Roundhay]] and [[Seacroft]]; and [[Shadwell, West Yorkshire|Shadwell]], which had been part of Wetherby Rural District. On 1 April 1925, the parish of Leeds was expanded to cover the whole borough.<ref name=vision_parish/>

The county borough was abolished on 1 April 1974, and its former area was combined with that of the municipal boroughs of [[Municipal Borough of Morley|Morley]] and [[Municipal Borough of Pudsey|Pudsey]]; the urban districts of [[Aireborough]], [[Horsforth]], [[Otley]], [[Garforth]] and [[Rothwell, West Yorkshire|Rothwell]]; and parts of the rural districts of [[Tadcaster Rural District|Tadcaster]], [[Wetherby Rural District|Wetherby]], and [[Wharfedale Rural District|Wharfedale]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Fraser|1982|p=459}}</ref> This area formed a metropolitan district in the county of [[West Yorkshire]]. It gained both borough and city status and is known as the [[City of Leeds]]. Initially, local government services were provided by [[Leeds City Council]] and [[West Yorkshire County Council]]. When the county council was abolished in 1986, the city council absorbed its functions, and some powers passed to organisations such as the [[West Yorkshire Metro|West Yorkshire Passenger Transport Authority]]. From 1988 two run-down and derelict areas close to the [[Leeds city centre|city centre]] were designated for regeneration and became the responsibility of [[Leeds Development Corporation]], outside the planning remit of the city council.<ref name=leeds_dc>{{cite web|url=http://www.communities.gov.uk/archived/general-content/citiesandregions/impacturban/ |title=Impact of Urban Development Corporations in Leeds, Bristol & Central Manchester |date=18 November 1998 |publisher=[[Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions]] |accessdate=25 September 2009 |deadurl=yes |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081211110418/http://www.communities.gov.uk/archived/general-content/citiesandregions/impacturban/ |archivedate=11 December 2008}}</ref> Planning powers were restored to the local authority in 1995 when the development corporation was wound up.

===Suburban growth===

[[File:James Valentine The Briggate Leeds.jpg|thumb|19th-century [[Briggate, Leeds]]]]
In 1801, 42% of the population of Leeds lived outside the township, in the wider borough. [[Cholera]] outbreaks in 1832 and 1849 caused the authorities to address the problems of drainage, sanitation, and water supply. Water was pumped from the River Wharfe, but by 1860 it was too heavily polluted to be usable. Following the Leeds Waterworks Act of 1867 three reservoirs were built at Lindley Wood, Swinsty, and Fewston in the Washburn Valley north of Leeds.<ref>{{Harvnb|Burt and Grady|1994|p=163}}</ref>

Residential growth occurred in Holbeck and Hunslet from 1801 to 1851, but, as these townships became industrialised new areas were favoured for middle class housing.<ref>{{Harvnb|Fraser|1982|p=96}}</ref> Land south of the river was developed primarily for industry and secondarily for [[Back-to-back house|back-to-back]] workers' dwellings. The Leeds Improvement Act 1866 sought to improve the quality of working class housing by restricting the number of homes that could be built in a single terrace.<ref name=discover_house>{{cite web|url= http://www.leodis.net/discovery/discovery.asp?page=2003218_676159084&topic=2003218_372249783&subsection=200342_125637234 |publisher=Leeds City Council |work=Discovering Leeds |title=The Working Classes: Housing |accessdate=26 September 2009}}</ref>

Holbeck and Leeds formed a continuous built-up area by 1858, with Hunslet nearly meeting them.<ref name="Fraser 1982 98">{{Harvnb|Fraser|1982|p=98}}</ref> In the latter half of the nineteenth century, population growth in Hunslet, Armley, and Wortley outstripped that of Leeds. When pollution became a problem, the wealthier residents left the industrial conurbation to live in Headingley, Potternewton and Chapel Allerton which led to a 50% increase in the population of Headingley and Burley from 1851 to 1861. The middle-class flight from the industrial areas led to development beyond the borough at Roundhay and Adel.<ref name="Fraser 1982 98"/> The introduction of the [[Leeds Tramway|electric tramway]] led to intensification of development in Headingley and Potternewton and expansion outside the borough into Roundhay.<ref>{{Harvnb|Fraser|1982|p=57}}</ref>

Two private gas supply companies were taken over by the corporation in 1870, and the municipal supply provided street lighting and cheaper gas to homes. From the early 1880s, the Yorkshire House-to-House Electricity Company supplied electricity to Leeds until it was purchased by Leeds Corporation and became a municipal supply.<ref>{{Harvnb|Burt and Grady|1994|p=193}}</ref>

[[Slum clearance]] and rebuilding began in Leeds during the [[interwar period]] when over 18,000 houses were built by the council on 24 estates in [[Cross Gates]], Middleton, Gipton, Belle Isle and Halton Moor. The slums of [[Quarry Hill, Leeds|Quarry Hill]] were replaced by the innovative Quarry Hill flats, which were demolished in 1975. Another 36,000 houses were built by private sector builders, creating suburbs in Gledhow, Moortown, Alwoodley, Roundhay, Colton, Whitkirk, [[Oakwood, Leeds|Oakwood]], Weetwood, and Adel. After 1949 a further 30,000 sub-standard houses were demolished by the council and replaced by 151 medium-rise and high-rise blocks of council flats in estates at Seacroft, Armley Heights, Tinshill, and Brackenwood.<ref>{{Harvnb|Unsworth and Stillwell|2004|p=77}}</ref>

Leeds has seen great expenditure on regenerating the city, attracting in investments and flagship projects,<ref name=leeds_skyscraper>{{cite web|url= http://www.skyscrapernews.com/news.php?ref=565 |website=www.skyscrapernews.com |title=Light Shines on Leeds Skyscraper Bids |accessdate=24 May 2010}}</ref> as found in [[Leeds city centre]].

[[File:Park Square and Leeds Town Hall - geograph.org.uk - 183544.jpg|left|thumb|Sunny early-June 2006 day at [[Park Square, Leeds|Park Square]]]]
Leeds has a climate that is [[Oceanic climate|oceanic]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]]: ''Cfb''), and influenced by the [[Pennines]]. Summers are usually mild, with moderate rainfall, while winters are chilly, cloudy with occasional snow and frost. The nearest official weather recording station is at Bingley, some twenty kilometres away at a higher altitude.<ref>[https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/public/weather/climate/gcwfhf1w0 Met Office Bingley temperatures] Retrieved 3 March 2018</ref>

July is the warmest month, with a mean temperature of {{convert|16|°C|0|abbr=on}}, while the coldest month is January, with a mean temperature of {{convert|3|°C|0|abbr=on}}. Temperatures above {{convert|30|°C|0|abbr=on}} and below {{convert|-10|°C|0|abbr=on}} are not very common but can happen occasionally.

===Green belt===
{{further|South and West Yorkshire Green Belt}}
Leeds is within a [[Green belt (United Kingdom)|green belt]] region that extends into the wider surrounding counties and is in place to reduce [[urban sprawl]], prevent the settlements in the West Yorkshire conurbation from further convergence, protect the identity of outlying communities, encourage [[Brownfield land|brownfield]] reuse, and preserve nearby countryside. This is achieved by restricting inappropriate development within the designated areas, and imposing stricter conditions on permitted building.<ref name="belt1">{{cite web|title=Unitary Development Plan|url=https://www.leeds.gov.uk/your-council/planning/unitary-development-plan|website=www.leeds.gov.uk}}</ref>

Over 60% of the Leeds district is green belt land and it surrounds the settlement, preventing further sprawl towards nearby communities. Larger outlying towns and villages are exempt from the green belt area. However, smaller villages, hamlets and rural areas are 'washed over' by the designation. The green belt was first adopted in 1960,<ref name="belt1"/> and the size in the borough in 2017 amounted to some {{convert|33,970|ha|km2+sqmi}}.<ref>{{cite web|title=Green belt statistics - GOV.UK|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/green-belt-statistics|website=www.gov.uk}}</ref>

A subsidiary aim of the green belt is to encourage recreation and leisure interests,<ref name="belt1"/> with rural landscape features, greenfield areas and facilities including Temple Newsam Park and House with golf course, Rothwell Country Park, Middleton Park, Kirkstall Abbey ruins and surrounding park, Bedquilts recreation grounds, Waterloo lake, Roundhay castle and park, and Morwick, Cobble and Elmete Halls.

[[File:Civic Hall Leeds West Yorkshire.jpg|right|thumb|[[Leeds Civic Hall]] is the seat of local government.]]
The [[City of Leeds]] is the [[Districts of England|local government district]] covering Leeds, and the local authority is [[Leeds City Council]]. The council is composed of 99 councillors, three for each of the district's [[wards of the United Kingdom|wards]]. Elections are held three years out of four, on the first Thursday of May. One third of the councillors are elected, for a four-year term, in each election. The council is currently controlled by [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]]. [[West Yorkshire]] does not have a county council, so Leeds City Council is the primary provider of local government services for the city. The district is in the [[Yorkshire and the Humber]] region of England.

Most of the district is an [[unparished area]]. In the unparished area, there is no lower tier of government. Outside the unparished area, there are 31 [[civil parish]]es, represented by [[Parish councils in England|parish councils]].

The district is represented by eight [[Member of Parliament|MP]]s, for the constituencies of [[Elmet and Rothwell (UK Parliament constituency)|Elmet and Rothwell]] ([[Alec Shelbrooke]], Conservative); [[Leeds Central (UK Parliament constituency)|Leeds Central]] ([[Hilary Benn]], Labour); [[Leeds East (UK Parliament constituency)|Leeds East]] ([[Richard Burgon]], Labour); [[Leeds North East (UK Parliament constituency)|Leeds North East]] ([[Fabian Hamilton]], Labour); [[Leeds North West (UK Parliament constituency)|Leeds North West]] ([[Alex Sobel]], Labour); [[Leeds West (UK Parliament constituency)|Leeds West]] ([[Rachel Reeves]], Labour); [[Morley and Outwood (UK Parliament constituency)|Morley and Outwood]] (constituency shared with [[City of Wakefield]]) ([[Andrea Jenkyns]], Conservative); and [[Pudsey (UK Parliament constituency)|Pudsey]] ([[Stuart Andrew]], Conservative). Leeds is within the [[Yorkshire and the Humber (European Parliament constituency)|Yorkshire and the Humber]] European constituency, which {{as of|May 2017|lc=on}} is represented by two [[United Kingdom Independence Party|UKIP]], two [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]], and two [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] [[Member of the European Parliament|Members of the European Parliament]].

Although the centre is below the average typical size for out of town shopping malls like the [[Trafford Centre]] or [[Meadowhall Centre|Meadowhall]] in nearby Yorkshire city [[Sheffield]], it remains popular with national and international chains. Of the 40,000 people who work in retailing in Leeds 75% work in places which are not located in the city centre. There are additional shopping centres located in the many villages that became part of the county borough and in the towns that were incorporated in the City of Leeds in 1974.<ref>{{Harvnb|Unsworth and Stillwell|2004|p=245}}</ref>

The main reason for these problems is the fact that unlike other cities in the UK similar in size to Leeds, such as [[Manchester]] and [[Sheffield]], Leeds does not have a rapid transport system (such as the [[Manchester Metrolink]] or [[Sheffield Supertram]]). Therefore, commuters tend to either drive or use buses, which can be delayed when the roads are congested. There were plans for a [[Leeds Supertram]] in the 1990s, and £500&nbsp;million in funding was to be provided; however, due to spiraling costs the plans were cancelled by the Transport Minister [[Alistair Darling]] in 2005, even though £40&nbsp;million had already been spent on the project. Hopes were renewed with the proposal for a £250&nbsp;million [[Trolleybuses in Leeds|New Generation Transport]] Trolleybus service in 2007; however, after a long wait and millions of pounds spent on inquiries, the plans were cancelled in May 2016 citing little value for money.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.yorkshireeveningpost.co.uk/news/transport/not-suitable-for-development-leeds-trolleybus-scheme-is-thrown-out-1-7907098 |title='Not suitable for development': Leeds trolleybus scheme is thrown out |work=Yorkshire Evening Post |date= |accessdate=12 August 2016}}</ref>

Leeds will introduce a clean air zone from January 2020, which will charge the most polluting buses, coaches HGVs £50 a day to enter the city, while taxis and private hire vehicles which are not clean enough will be charged £12.50 a day. The proposals came after the government ordered the council to come up with ways to lower the air pollution in the city, which causes around 29,000 premature deaths in the UK.<ref>https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/oct/09/drivers-faced-with-50-daily-charge-in-leeds-to-cut-air-pollution</ref>

===Art===
[[File:Leeds. Henry Moore town - geograph.org.uk - 353135.jpg|thumb|Henry Moore Statue outside [[Leeds Art Gallery]] ]]
Although the city's municipal art gallery did not open until 1888, the history of art practise and collecting has a long history in Leeds. [[J. M. W. Turner]] painted numerous scenes in and around the city,<ref>David Hill, ''Turner and Leeds'' (Leeds: Northern Arts Publications, 2008) p.1f</ref> and the city was home to one of Britain's largest collections of Pre-Raphaelite Art, owned by Thomas Plint, during the nineteenth century.<ref>Caroline Arscott, 'Without Distinction of Party' in Janet Wolff and John Seed (eds.)''The Culture of Capital'' (Manchester: Manchester University Press, 1988) p.135</ref> There was also an early history of holding large-scale public exhibitions in the city, most notably the series of 'Polytechnic Exhibitions' held regularly from 1839.<ref>Toshio Kusamitsu, 'Great Exhibitions before 1851' in ''History Workshop'', No. 9 (Spring, 1980), p.76f. See also Caroline Arscott, 'Without Distinction of Party' in Janet Wolff and John Seed (eds.)''The Culture of Capital'' (Manchester: Manchester University Press, 1988) p.135</ref>

Leeds produced many notable artists and sculptors, including [[Kenneth Armitage]], [[John Atkinson Grimshaw]], [[Jacob Kramer]], [[Barbara Hepworth]], [[Henry Moore]], [[Edward Wadsworth]] and [[Joash Woodrow]], and was the centre for a particularly radical strain of British art. Before the First World War Leeds was the home of an unusual modernist arts organisation, called the [[Leeds Arts Club]], founded by [[Alfred Richard Orage|Alfred Orage]], which lasted from 1903 to 1923. Notable members included [[Jacob Kramer]], [[Herbert Read]], [[Frank Rutter]] and [[Michael Sadler (educationist)|Michael Sadler]]. As well as advocating a radical political agenda, supporting the [[Suffragette]]s, the [[Independent Labour Party]] and the [[Fabian Society]], and promoting the philosophy of [[Friedrich Nietzsche]], the Leeds Arts Club was almost unique in Britain as being an exponent of [[German Expressionism|German Expressionist]] ideas about art and culture. As a result, it staged very early British exhibitions of work by European expressionist artists, such as [[Wassily Kandinsky]], showing their work in the city as early as 1913,<ref>Tom Steele, ''Alfred Orage and the Leeds Arts Club'' (London: Orage Press, 2009)</ref> and produced its own English Expressionist artists, including Jacob Kramer and Bruce Turner.<ref>Michael Paraskos, ''The Yorkshire Art Exhibition'' (Scarborough: Scarborough Museum and Art Gallery, 2000); see also Michael Paraskos, ''English Expressionism'' (unpublished academic dissertation, University of Leeds, 1997)</ref>

In the 1920s Leeds College of Art was the starting point for the careers of the sculptors [[Barbara Hepworth]] and [[Henry Moore]], and in the 1950s, and 1960s it was one of the leading centres for radical art education in Britain under the guidance of artists such as [[Harry Thubron]] and [[Thomas Hudson (painter)|Tom Hudson]], and the art historian [[Norbert Lynton]]. Their attempts to redefine what art education should mean in the post-[[World War II|Second World War]] period led the artist [[Patrick Heron]] to claim in 1971 in ''The Guardian'' newspaper that "Leeds is the most influential art school in Europe since the [[Bauhaus]]".<ref>Patrick Heron, 'Murder of the Art Schools', in ''The Guardian'' (UK newspaper), 12 October 1971, p.8</ref> This willingness to push at the boundaries of acceptable public behaviour from artists was also evident in 1966 when Leeds College of Art staged an exhibition of paintings by the Cypriot artist [[Stass Paraskos]], who taught at the College, which was raided by the police after allegations of obscenity.<ref>Norbert Lynton, ''Stass Paraskos'' (Mitcham: Orage Press, 2003) p.7f</ref>

This radicalism continued into the 1970s when the higher education component of Leeds College of Art was split from the college to form the nucleus of the new multidisciplinary Leeds Polytechnic, now called [[Leeds Beckett University]]. Performance art had been taught earlier at Leeds College of Art, notably by the [[Fluxus]] artist [[Robin Page]] during his time as a tutor there in the mid-1960s, but in 1977 a performance art work hit the national news headlines when the students Pete Parkin and Derek Wain used an air pistol to shoot a line up of live [[budgerigar]]s in front of an audience at Leeds Polytechnic.<ref>Paul Rooney, ''Thin Air'' (Leeds: Leeds Metropolitan University, 2009) p.10f</ref>

The [[University of Leeds]] was the ''alma mater'' of [[Herbert Read]], one of the leading international theorists of modern art from the mid-twentieth century,<ref>Michael Paraskos, 'Herbert Read and Leeds', in Benedict Read and David Thistlewood, ''Herbert Read: A British Vision of World Art'' (Leeds: Leeds City Art Gallery, 1993) p.25</ref> and also the teaching base for the [[Marxism|Marxist]] art historian [[Arnold Hauser]] from 1951 to 1985.<ref>Katharina Scherke, 'Arnold Hauser and the Social History of Art', in Peter Weibel, ''Beyond Art: A Third Culture: A Comparative Study in Cultures, Art and Science in 20th Century Austria and Hungary'' (Berlin: Springer, 2005) p.478</ref> Partly due to Herbert Read's connection with the University, from 1950 to 1970 the University was the host of one of the first [[artist-in-residence]] schemes in Britain, using funding from the then owner of [[Ashgate Publishing|Lund Humphries]] books, Peter Gregory. The Gregory Fellowships, as the residencies were known, were given to painters and sculptors for up to two years to allow them to develop their own work and influence the University in any way they saw fit. Amongst those holding the fellowships were [[Kenneth Armitage]], [[Reg Butler]], [[Dennis Creffield]] and [[Terry Frost]] and others. Parallel Gregory Fellowships also existed in music and poetry at the University.<ref>Hilary Diaper, 'The Gregory Fellowships', in Benedict Read and David Thistlewood, ''Herbert Read: A British Vision of World Art'' (Leeds: Leeds City Art Gallery, 1993) p.133f</ref>

Leeds was also a centre for radical feminist art, with one of the first galleries in Britain dedicated to showing the work of women photographers, the Pavilion Gallery, opening in the city in 1983, and the [[University of Leeds]] School of Fine Art being a well-known centre for the development of feminist art history, under [[Griselda Pollock]], during the 1980s and 1990s. Possibly as a result of the strength of feminist art in Leeds, in November 1984 an exhibition of ceramics by students and staff at Leeds Polytechnic was attacked by a group of feminist activists who destroyed eight sculptures on display which they deemed to be degrading to women.<ref>John A. Walker, ''Art and Outrage'' (London: Pluto Press, 1999) pp. 134–138</ref> The University of Leeds's School of Fine Art also specialised in [[Art & Language]] conceptual art practice, under [[Terry Atkinson]], again in the 1980s and 1990s.<ref>James Charnley, ''Creative Licence: From Leeds College of Art to Leeds Polytechnic, 1963-1973'' (Cambridge: James Clarke and Co Ltd, 2015) p.254</ref>

A major sculpture research centre and gallery, the [[Henry Moore Foundation|Henry Moore Institute]], is located alongside [[Leeds Art Gallery]] in the city centre, and in 2013 a new contemporary art centre, called [[The Tetley (Leeds)|The Tetley]], opened on the site of the former Tetley Brewery to the south of the city centre.

In March 2017, ''[[The Times]]'' voted Leeds as the number one cultural place to live in Britain. This was ahead of London, [[Birmingham]], [[St Ives, Cornwall|St Ives]], [[Stratford-upon-Avon]] and [[Cheltenham]]. The citation notes that Leeds has [[Opera North]], the [[Northern Ballet]], and the [[West Yorkshire Playhouse]], amongst may other attractions that ranked it at number one.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Whateley|first1=Laura|title=20 best cultural places to live|work=The Times|issue=72171|date=15 March 2017|location=times2 supplement|pages=6–7|issn=0140-0460}}</ref>
