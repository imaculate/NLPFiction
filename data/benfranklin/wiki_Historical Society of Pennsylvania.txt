The '''Historical Society of Pennsylvania''' is a historical society founded in 1824 and based in [[Philadelphia]]. The Society's building, designed by [[Addison Hutton]] and listed on Philadelphia's Register of Historical Places, houses some 600,000 printed items and over 19 million manuscript and graphic items. The Society maintains printed collections on [[Pennsylvania]] and regional history and manuscript collections covering 17th-, 18th- and 19th-century history. The holdings of the Balch Institute for Ethnic Studies were added in 2002 and those of the [[Genealogical Society of Pennsylvania]] in 2006. The Historical Society has recently undertaken efforts to appeal to a younger demographic, including having [[beverage function|open bar]] events.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://hsp.org/become-a-member/young-friends|title=Young Friends – Historical Society of Pennsylvania|author=|date=|website=hsp.org|accessdate=8 April 2018}}</ref>

==Building==
The society's building on the southwest corner of 13th and Locust Streets was formerly the site of the Patterson Mansion. General [[Robert Patterson]], a general of the [[Mexican–American War|Mexican-American]] and [[Civil war|Civil War]]s purchased the mansion from [[John Hare Powell]], the founder of the Pennsylvania Agricultural Society. After Patterson’s death in 1881, the Historical Society of Pennsylvania purchased the mansion as its permanent home. The mansion was demolished between 1905 and 1909 and the main block of a new fireproof building, again designed by Addison Hutton, was constructed on site. The totally fireproof building was dedicated in 1910.

== Constitutive Act ==
Membership was regulated by the statutory of the Association.
In particular, article IV stated that "the members of the Historical Society of Pennsylvania shall be deemed qualified voters at the meetings and elections, who have subscribed to the Constitution, and who have paid all their dues to the Society"<ref>{{cite book | url = https://books.google.it/books?id=XiG27B6jnS8C&printsec=frontcover&hl=it| title = | year = 1856 | language = en | pages = 84 | access-date = Sep 16, 2018 | archive-url = | archive-date = | deadurl = no}}</ref><ref>{{cite book | url = https://www.forgottenbooks.com/en/books/TheHistoricalSocietyofPennsylvania_10192851 | title = The Historical Society of Pennsylvania | publisher = Pennsylvania.

==In popular culture==
*In May 2016, a play by [[Ain Gordon]], ''217 Boxes of Dr. Henry Anonymous'' – based on Gordon's research as an "embedded artist" at the Historical Society of Pennsylvania, where Dr. [[John E. Fryer]]'s papers are archived – premiered at the [[Painted Bride Art Center]] in Philadelphia.  The play explores Fryer and the circumstances around his disguised appearance at the [[American Psychiatric Association]]'s 1972 convention in [[Dallas, Texas|Dallas]] as "Dr. Henry Anonymous" in a debate called "Psychiatry: Friend or Foe to the Homosexual?" in a successful attempt to have homosexuality removed from the APA's ''[[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]]'', where it was listed as a mental disease. The play uses monologues by three people who knew him: Alfred A. Gross, the New York-based head of the George W. Henry Foundation, a social charity which helped homosexual men who had gotten into trouble with the law; Katherine Luder, Fryer's long-time secretary; and Fryer's father, Ercel Ray Fryer.<ref>[https://hsp.org/playwright "An Artist Embedded"] Historical Society of Pennsylvania website</ref><ref>Staff (April 25, 2016) [http://www.broadwayworld.com/philadelphia/article/Ain-Gordon-World-Premiere-Set-for-Painted-Bride-Arts-Center-20160425 "Ain Gordon World Premiere Set for Painted Bride Arts Center"] ''Broadway World Philadelphia''</ref><ref>Derakhshani, Tirdad (May 5, 2016) [http://www.philly.com/philly/entertainment/arts/20160505__217_Boxes__at_the_Painted_Bride__A_courageous_mystery_man_who_changed_history.html "'217 Boxes' at the Painted Bride: A courageous mystery man who changed history"] ''[[Philadelphia Inquirer]]''</ref><ref>Crimmins, Peter (May 4, 2016) [http://www.newsworks.org/index.php/local/arts-culture/93398-raising-the-curtain-on-life-of-dr-anonymous-philly-gay-rights-pioneer "Raising the curtain on life of Dr. Anonymous, Philly gay rights pioneer"] ''Newsworks''</ref>
