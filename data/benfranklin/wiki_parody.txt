A '''parody''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|p|ær|ə|d|i}}); also called a '''spoof''', '''send-up''', '''take-off''', '''lampoon''', '''play on (something)''', '''caricature''', or '''joke''' is a work created to imitate, make fun of, or comment on an [[original work]]—its subject, author, style, or some other target—by means of [[satire|satiric]] or [[irony|ironic]] [[imitation]]. As the literary theorist [[Linda Hutcheon]] puts it, "parody ... is imitation, not always at the expense of the parodied text." Another critic, Simon Dentith, defines parody as "any cultural practice which provides a relatively [[polemic]]al allusive imitation of another cultural production or practice."<ref>Dentith (2000) p.9</ref>
Parody may be found in art or culture, including [[literature]], [[parody music|music]] (although "parody" in music has an earlier, somewhat different meaning than for other art forms), [[animation]], [[Video game|gaming]], and [[film]].

The writer and critic [[John Gross]] observes in his ''Oxford Book of Parodies'', that parody seems to flourish on territory somewhere between [[pastiche]] ("a composition in another artist's manner, without satirical intent") and [[burlesque]] (which "fools around with the material of high literature and adapts it to low ends").<ref>{{cite journal |author=J.M.W. Thompson  |title=Close to the Bone |publisher=Standpoint magazine |date= May 2010 |url=http://standpointmag.co.uk/books-may-10-close-to-the-bone-oxford-book-of-parodies-john-gross}}</ref> Meanwhile, the ''[[Encyclopédie]]'' of [[Denis Diderot]] distinguishes between the parody and the burlesque, "A good parody is a fine amusement, capable of amusing and instructing the most sensible and polished minds; the burlesque is a miserable buffoonery which can only please the populace."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://hdl.handle.net/2027/spo.did2222.0000.811|title=Parody|website=Hdl.handle.net|accessdate=3 October 2018}}</ref> Historically, when a formula grows tired, as in the case of the moralistic melodramas in the 1910s, it retains value only as a parody, as demonstrated by the [[Buster Keaton]] shorts that mocked that genre.<ref name="Balducci2011p231">{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pSa-fqnL7iIC&pg=PA231|title=The Funny Parts: A History of Film Comedy Routines and Gags|first=Anthony|last=Balducci|date=28 November 2011|publisher=McFarland|accessdate=3 October 2018|via=Google Books}}</ref>

==Origins==
According to [[Aristotle]] (''[[Poetics (Aristotle)|Poetics]]'', ii. 5), [[Hegemon of Thasos]] was the inventor of a kind of parody; by slightly altering the wording in well-known poems he transformed the sublime into the ridiculous. In ancient [[Greek literature]], a ''parodia'' was a narrative poem imitating the style and prosody of [[Epic poetry|epic]]s "but treating light, satirical or [[mock-heroic]] subjects."<ref>(Denith, 10)</ref> Indeed, the components of the Greek word are παρά ''para'' "beside, counter, against" and ᾠδή ''oide'' "song." Thus, the original Greek word παρῳδία ''parodia'' has sometimes been taken to mean "counter-song", an imitation that is set against the original. The ''Oxford English Dictionary'', for example, defines parody as imitation "turned as to produce a ridiculous effect."<ref>Quoted in Hutcheon, 32.</ref> Because ''par-'' also has the non-antagonistic meaning of ''beside'', "there is nothing in ''parodia'' to necessitate the inclusion of a concept of ridicule."<ref>(Hutcheon, 32)</ref> [[Old Comedy]] contained parody, even the gods could be made fun of. ''[[The Frogs]]'' portrays the hero-turned-god [[Heracles]] as a glutton and the God of Drama [[Dionysus]] as cowardly and unintelligent. The traditional trip to the Underworld story is parodied as Dionysus dresses as Heracles to go to the Underworld, in an attempt to bring back a Poet to save Athens.

In the 2nd century AD, [[Lucian of Samosata]], a Greek-language writer in [[Syria]], created a parody of travel/geography texts like [[Indica (Ctesias)|Indica]] and [[The Odyssey]]. He described the authors of such accounts as liars who had never traveled, nor talked to any credible person who had. In his ironically named book [[True History]] Lucian delivers a story which exaggerates the hyperbole and improbable claims of those stories. Sometimes described as the first [[Science Fiction]], along the lines of [[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy]], the [[Character (arts)|characters]] travel to the moon, engage in interplanetary war with the help of aliens they meet there, and then return to the earth to experience civilization inside a 200 mile long creature generally interpreted as being a whale. This is a parody of [[Ctesias]]' claims that India has a one-legged race of humans with a single foot so huge it can be used as an umbrella, [[Homer]]'s stories of one-eyed giants, and so on.

[[Ancient Rome|Roman]] writers explained parody as an imitation of one poet by another for humorous effect.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}} In [[France|French]] [[Neoclassical literature]], ''parody'' was also a type of poem where one work imitates the style of another to produce a humorous effect. The [[Ancient Greece|Ancient Greeks]] created [[satyr]] [[Play (theatre)|play]]s which parodied [[tragic play]]s, often with performers dressed like satyrs.

==Music==
{{Main|Parody music}}
In [[classical music]], as a technical term, ''parody'' refers to a reworking of one kind of composition into another (for example, a [[motet]] into a keyboard work as [[Girolamo Cavazzoni]], [[Antonio de Cabezón]], and [[Alonso Mudarra]] all did to [[Josquin des Prez]] [[motet]]s).<ref name=g1>Tilmouth, Michael and Richard Sherr. [http://www.oxfordmusiconline.com/subscriber/article/grove/music/20937 "Parody (i)"]'  Grove Music Online, Oxford Music Online, accessed 19 February 2012 {{subscription}}</ref> More commonly, a [[parody mass]] (''missa parodia'') or an [[oratorio]] used extensive quotation from other vocal works such as motets or [[cantata]]s; [[Tomás Luis de Victoria|Victoria]], [[Giovanni Pierluigi da Palestrina|Palestrina]], [[Orlande de Lassus|Lassus]], and other composers of the 16th century used this technique. The term is also sometimes applied to procedures common in the [[Baroque music|Baroque period]], such as when [[Johann Sebastian Bach|Bach]] reworks music from [[Bach cantata|cantata]]s in his ''[[Christmas Oratorio]]''.

The musicological definition of the term ''parody'' has now generally been supplanted by a more general meaning of the word. In its more contemporary usage, [[parody music|musical parody]] usually has humorous, even satirical intent, in which familiar musical ideas or lyrics are lifted into a different, often incongruous, context.<ref name=g2>Burkholder, J. Peter. [http://www.oxfordmusiconline.com/subscriber/article/grove/music/52918pg8  "Borrowing"], Grove Music Online, Oxford Music Online, accessed 19 February. 2012 {{subscription}}</ref> Musical parodies may imitate or refer to the peculiar style of a composer or artist, or even a general style of music. For example, ''The Ritz Roll and Rock'', a song and dance number performed by [[Fred Astaire]] in the movie ''[[Silk Stockings]]'', parodies the [[Rock and Roll]] genre. Conversely, while the best-known work of [[Weird Al Yankovic]] is based on particular popular songs, it also often utilises wildly incongruous elements of [[popular culture|pop culture]] for comedic effect.

==English term==
[[File:Jan Brueghel the Younger, Satire on Tulip Mania, c. 1640.jpg|thumb|''{{Interlanguage link multi|Allegory of the Tulip omania|de|3=Allegorie der Tulipomanie}}'', persiflage on the [[tulip mania]], by [[Jan Brueghel the Younger]] (1640s]]

The first usage of the word ''parody'' in English cited in the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' is in [[Ben Jonson]], in ''Every Man in His Humour'' in 1598: "A Parodie, a parodie! to make it absurder than it was." The next citation comes from [[John Dryden]] in 1693, who also appended an explanation, suggesting that the word was in common use, meaning to make fun of or re-create what you are doing.

==Modernist and post-modernist parody==
In the 20th century, parody has been heightened as the central and most representative artistic device, the catalysing agent of artistic creation and innovation.<ref name="Sheinberg 2000p141">Sheinberg (2000) pp.141, 150</ref><ref name="Stavans1997p37">Stavans (1997) [https://books.google.com/books?id=Ro6a1EyaS2AC&pg=PA37 p.37]</ref> This most prominently happened in the second half of the century with [[postmodernism]], but earlier [[modernism]] and [[Russian formalism]] had anticipated this perspective.<ref name="Sheinberg 2000p141"/><ref>Bradbury, Malcolm [https://books.google.com/books?id=hUtOMoCNHyIC ''No, not Bloomsbury''] p.53, quoting [[Boris Eikhenbaum]]: {{quotation|Nearly all periods of artistic innovation have had a strong parodic impulse, advancing generic change. As the Russian formalist Boris Eichenbaum once put it: "In the evolution of each genre, there are times when its use for entirely serious or elevated objectives degenerates and produces a comic or parodic form....And thus is produced the regeneration of the genre: it finds new possibilities and new forms."}}</ref> For the Russian formalists, parody was a way of liberation from the background text that enables to produce new and autonomous artistic forms.<ref name="Hutcheon85p28">Hutcheon (1985) pp.28, 35</ref><ref>[[Boris Eikhenbaum]] ''Theory of the "Formal Method"'' (1925) and ''O.

[[Jorge Luis Borges]]'s (1939) short story "[[Pierre Menard, Author of the Quixote]]", is often regarded as predicting postmodernism and conceiving the ideal of the ultimate parody.<ref name="Stavans1997p31">Stavans (1997) [https://books.google.com/books?id=Ro6a1EyaS2AC&pg=PA31 p.31]</ref><ref>Elizabeth Bellalouna, Michael L.

Blank parody, in which an artist takes the skeletal form of an art work and places it in a new context without ridiculing it, is common.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}} [[Pastiche]] is a closely related [[genre]], and parody can also occur when characters or settings belonging to one work are used in a humorous or ironic way in another, such as the transformation of minor characters [[Rosencrantz and Guildenstern]] from [[Shakespeare]]'s drama [[Hamlet]] into the principal characters in a comedic perspective on the same events in the play (and film) ''[[Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead]]''.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}} Similarly, [[Mishu Hilmy]]'s ''Trapped in the Netflix'' uses parody to [[Deconstruction|deconstruct]] contemporary [[Netflix]] shows like [[Mad Men]] providing commentary through popular characters.

This combination of established and identifiable characters in a new setting is not the same as the [[post-modernist]] trope of using historical characters in fiction out of context to provide a metaphoric element.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}}

==Reputation==
Sometimes the reputation of a parody outlasts the reputation of what is being parodied. For example, ''[[Don Quixote]]'', which mocks the traditional [[knight errant]] tales, is much better known than the novel that inspired it, ''[[Amadis de Gaula]]'' (although Amadis is mentioned in the book). Another case is the [[novel]] ''[[Shamela]]''  by [[Henry Fielding]] (1742), which was a parody of the gloomy [[epistolary novel]] ''[[Pamela (novel)|Pamela, or Virtue Rewarded]]'' (1740) by [[Samuel Richardson]]. Many of [[Lewis Carroll]]'s parodies of Victorian didactic verse for children, such as "[[You Are Old, Father William]]", are much better known than the (largely forgotten) originals. [[Stella Gibbons]]'s comic novel ''[[Cold Comfort Farm]]'' has eclipsed the pastoral novels of [[Mary Webb]] which largely inspired it.

In more recent times, the television sitcom ''[['Allo 'Allo!]]'' is perhaps better known than the drama ''[[Secret Army (TV series)|Secret Army]]'' which it parodies.

Some artists carve out careers by making parodies. One of the best-known examples is that of [["Weird Al" Yankovic]]. His career of parodying other musical acts and their songs has outlasted many of the artists or bands he has parodied.  Yankovic is not required under law to get permission to parody; as a personal rule, however, he does seek permission to parody a person's song before recording it. Several artists, such as rapper [[Chamillionaire]] and Seattle-based [[grunge]] band [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]] stated that Yankovic's parodies of their respective songs were excellent, and many artists have considered being parodied by him to be a badge of honor.<ref name="Ayers">{{cite news|url=https://blogs.wsj.com/speakeasy/2014/07/24/weird-al-interview-mandatory-fun/|title=‘Weird Al’ Yankovic Explains His Secret Formula for Going Viral and Hitting No. 1|last=Ayers|first=Mike|date=24 July 2014|work=[[The Wall Street Journal]]|accessdate=12 September 2015}}</ref><ref name="Hamersly">{{cite news|url=http://www.miami.com/quotweird-alquot-yankovic-brings-his-masterful-musical-parody-south-florida-article|title="Weird Al" Yankovic brings his masterful musical parody to South Florida|last=Hamersly|first=Michael|work=[[Miami Herald]]|accessdate=12 September 2015}}</ref>

In the US legal system the point that in most cases a parody of a work constitutes fair use was upheld in the case of [[Rick Dees]], who decided to use 29 seconds of the music from the song ''When Sonny Gets Blue'' to parody [[Johnny Mathis]]' singing style even after being refused permission. An appeals court upheld the trial court's decision that this type of parody represents fair use. ''[[Fisher v. Dees]]'' [[Court citation|794 F.2d 432]] (9th Cir. 1986)

==Film parodies==
{{Main article|Parody film}}
{{Original research|section|date=May 2009}}
Some [[Genre|genre theorists]], following [[Bakhtin]], see parody as a natural development in the life cycle of any [[genre]]; this idea has proven especially fruitful for genre film theorists. Such theorists note that [[Western movie]]s, for example, after the classic stage defined the conventions of the genre, underwent a parody stage, in which those same conventions were ridiculed and critiqued. Because audiences had seen these classic Westerns, they had expectations for any new Westerns, and when these expectations were inverted, the audience laughed.

Perhaps the earliest parody film was the 1922 ''[[Mud and Sand]]'', a [[Stan Laurel]] film that made fun of [[Rudolph Valentino]]'s film ''[[Blood and Sand (1922 film)|Blood and Sand]]''. Laurel specialized in parodies in the mid-1920s, writing and acting in a number of them. Some were send-ups of popular films, such as ''[[Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde (disambiguation)|Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde]]''<!-- there are several such films so don't disambiguate this link -->—parodied in the comic ''[[Dr. Pyckle and Mr. Pryde]]'' (1926). Others were spoofs of Broadway plays, such as ''[[No, No, Nanette]]'' (1925), parodied as ''[[Yes, Yes, Nanette]]'' (1925). In 1940 [[Charlie Chaplin]] created a satirical comedy about [[Adolf Hitler]] with the film ''[[The Great Dictator]]'', following the first-ever Hollywood parody of the Nazis, the [[Three Stooges]]' short subject ''[[You Nazty Spy!]]''.

About 20 years later [[Mel Brooks]] started his career with a Hitler parody as well. After ''[[The Producers (1968 film)|The Producers]]'' (1968), Brooks became one of the most famous film parodists and did spoofs on any kind of film genre. ''[[Blazing Saddles]]'' (1974) is a parody of western films, ''[[Young Frankenstein]]'' (1974) is a [[Frankenstein]] spoof, ''[[Spaceballs]]'' (1987) is a ''[[Star Wars]]'' spoof, and ''[[Robin Hood Men in Tights]]'' (1993) is Brooks' take on the classic Robin Hood tale.

The British comedy group [[Monty Python]] is also famous for its parodies, for example, the [[King Arthur]] spoof ''[[Monty Python and the Holy Grail]]'' (1974), and the [[Jesus]] satire ''[[Life of Brian]]'' (1979). In the 1980s the team of [[David Zucker (filmmaker)|David Zucker]], [[Jim Abrahams]] and [[Jerry Zucker (film director)|Jerry Zucker]] parodied well-established genres such as disaster, war and crime movies with the ''[[Airplane!]]'', ''[[Hot Shots!]]'' and ''[[The Naked Gun|Naked Gun]]'' series respectively. There is a 1989 film parody from Spain of the TV series ''[[The A-Team]]'' called ''El equipo Aahhgg'' directed by José Truchado.

More recently, parodies have taken on whole film genres at once. One of the first was ''[[Don't Be a Menace to South Central While Drinking Your Juice in the Hood]]'' and the ''[[Scary Movie (series)|Scary Movie]]'' franchise. Other recent genre parodies include. ''[[Shriek If You Know What I Did Last Friday The 13th]]'', ''[[Not Another Teen Movie]]'', ''[[Date Movie]]'', ''[[Epic Movie]]'', ''[[Meet the Spartans]]'', ''[[Superhero Movie]]'', ''[[Disaster Movie]]'', ''[[Vampires Suck]]'', and ''[[The 41-Year-Old Virgin Who Knocked Up Sarah Marshall and Felt Superbad About It]]'', all of which have been critically panned.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}

===Copyright===
Many parody films have as their target out-of-copyright or non-copyrighted subjects (such as ''Frankenstein'' or Robin Hood) whilst others settle for imitation which does not infringe copyright, but is clearly aimed at a popular (and usually lucrative) subject. The spy film craze of the 1960s, fuelled by the popularity of [[James Bond]] is such an example. In this genre a rare, and possibly unique, example of a parody film taking aim at a non-comedic subject over which it actually holds copyright is the 1967 James Bond spoof ''[[Casino Royale (1967 film)|Casino Royale]]''. In this case, producer [[Charles K. Feldman]] initially intended to make a serious film, but decided that it would not be able to compete with the established series of Bond films. Hence, he decided to parody the series.<ref>Barnes, A. & Hearn, M. (1997) ''Kiss kiss bang bang: the unofficial James Bond film companion'', Batsford, p. 63 {{ISBN|9780713481822}}</ref>

==Poetic parodies==
[[Kenneth Baker, Baron Baker of Dorking|Kenneth Baker]] considered poetic parody to take five main forms.<ref>K. Baker ed., ''Unauthorized Versions'' (London 1990) Introduction p. xx–xxii</ref>
# The first was to use parody to attack the author parodied, as in [[J K Stephen]]'s mimicry of [[Wordsworth]], “Two voices are there: one is of the deep....And one is of an old half-witted sheep.”<ref>K. Baker ed., ''Unauthorized Versions'' (London 1990) p. 429</ref>
# The second was to pastiche the author's style, as with [[Henry Reed (poet)|Henry Reed]]'s parody of [[T. S. Eliot]], ''Chard Whitlow'': “As we get older we do not get any younger....”<ref>K. Baker ed., ''Unauthorized Versions'' (London 1990) p. 107</ref>
# The third type reversed (and so undercut) the sentiments of the poem parodied, as with [[Monty Python]]'s ''All Things Dull and Ugly''.
# A fourth approach was to use the target poem as a matrix for inserting unrelated (generally humorous) material&nbsp;– “To have it out or not? That is the question....Thus dentists do make cowards of us all.”<ref>K. Baker ed., ''Unauthorized Versions'' (London 1990) p. 319</ref>
# Finally, parody may be used to attack contemporary/topical targets by utilizing the format of a well-known piece of verse: “O [[Salman Rushdie|Rushdie]], Rushdie, it's a vile world” ([[Cat Stevens]]).<ref>K. Baker ed., ''Unauthorized Versions'' (London 1990) p. 355</ref>

A further, more constructive form of poetic parody is one that links the contemporary poet with past forms and past masters through affectionate parodying&nbsp;– thus sharing poetic codes while avoiding some of the [[anxiety of influence]].<ref>S. Cushman ed., ''The Princeton Encyclopedia of Poetry and Poetics'' (Princeton 2012) p. 1003</ref>

More aggressive in tone are playground poetry parodies, often attacking authority, values and culture itself in a carnivalesque rebellion:<ref>J. Thomas, ''Poetry's Playground'' (2007) p. 45-52</ref> “Twinkle, Twinkle little star,/ Who the hell do you think you are?”<ref>Quoted in S. Burt ed., ''The Cambridge History of American Poetry'' (Cambridge 2014)</ref>

==Self-parody==
{{Main|Self-parody}}
A subset of parody is ''[[self-parody]]'' in which artists parody their own work (as in [[Ricky Gervais]]'s ''[[Extras (sitcom)|Extras]]'') or distinctions of their work (such as [[Antonio Banderas]]'s [[Puss in Boots (Shrek)|Puss in Boots]] in the ''[[Shrek]]'' [[sequel]]s) or an artist or genre repeats elements of earlier works to the point that originality is lost.

==Copyright issues==
{{see also|Plagiarism}}

Although a parody can be considered a [[derivative work]] of a pre-existing, copyrighted work, some countries have ruled that parodies can fall under [[copyright limitation]]s such as [[fair dealing]], or otherwise have fair dealing laws that include parody in their scope.

===United States===
Parodies are protected under the [[fair use]] doctrine of [[United States copyright law]], but the defense is more successful if the usage of an existing copyrighted work is transformative in nature, such as being a critique or commentary upon it.

In ''[[Campbell v. Acuff-Rose Music, Inc.]]'', the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]]  ruled that a rap parody of "[[Oh, Pretty Woman]]" by [[2 Live Crew]] was fair use, as the parody was a distinctive, transformative work designed to ridicule the original song, and that "even if 2 Live Crew's copying of the original's first line of lyrics and characteristic opening bass riff may be said to go to the original's 'heart,' that heart is what most readily conjures up the song for parody, and it is the heart at which parody takes aim."

In 2001, the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit|Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals]], in ''[[Suntrust v. Houghton Mifflin]]'', upheld the right of [[Alice Randall]] to publish a parody of ''[[Gone with the Wind (novel)|Gone with the Wind]]'' called ''[[The Wind Done Gone]]'', which told the same story from the point of view of [[Scarlett O'Hara]]'s slaves, who were glad to be rid of her.

In 2007, the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit|Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals]] denied a fair use defense in the ''Dr. Seuss Enterprises v. Penguin Books'' case. Citing the ''Campbell v. Acuff-Rose'' decision, they found that a [[satire]] of the [[O. J. Simpson murder case|O.J. Simpson murder trial]] and parody of ''[[The Cat in the Hat]]'' had infringed upon the children's book because it did not provide a commentary function upon that work.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://fairuse.stanford.edu/Copyright_and_Fair_Use_Overview/chapter9/9-c.html|title=Summaries of Fair Use Cases|author=Richard Stim|work=Stanford Copyright and Fair Use Center}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=15758460119711775481&hl=en&as_sdt=2&as_vis=1&oi=scholarr|title=Google Scholar|work=google.com}}</ref>

===Canada===
{{update|type=section|Changes from the Copyright Modernization Act, 2012|date=September 2012}}
Under [[Canadian law]], although there is protection for [[fair dealing#Canada|Fair Dealing]], there is no explicit protection for parody and satire. In ''[[Canwest v. Horizon]]'', the publisher of the [[Vancouver Sun]] launched a [[lawsuit]] against a group which had published a pro-[[State of Palestine|Palestinian]] parody of the paper. Alan Donaldson, the judge in the case, [[court ruling|ruled]] that parody is not a [[legal defence|defence]] to a [[Canadian copyright law|copyright]] claim.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://thetyee.ca/Mediacheck/2008/12/11/CanwestSuit/|title=The Tyee&nbsp;– Canwest Suit May Test Limits of Free Speech|date=11 December 2008|work=The Tyee}}</ref>

===United Kingdom===
In 2006 the ''[[Gowers Review of Intellectual Property]]'' recommended that the UK should "create an exception to copyright for the purpose of caricature, parody or pastiche by 2008."<ref>The Stationery Office. (2006) Gowers Review of Intellectual Property. [Online]. Available at [http://www.official-documents.gov.uk/document/other/0118404830/0118404830.pdf official-documents.gov.uk] (Accessed: 22 February 2011).</ref> Following the first stage of a two-part public consultation, the Intellectual Property Office reported that the information received "was not sufficient to persuade us that the advantages of a new parody exception were sufficient to override the disadvantages to the creators and owners of the underlying work.

However, following the Hargreaves Review in May 2011 (which made similar proposals to the Gowers Review) the Government broadly accepted these proposals.  The current law (effective from 1 October 2014), namely Section 30A<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2014/2356/regulation/5/made|title=The Copyright and Rights in Performances (Quotation and Parody) Regulations 2014|website=Legislation.gov.uk|accessdate=3 October 2018}}</ref> of the [[Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988]], now provides an exception to infringement where there is fair dealing of the original work for the purpose of parody (or alternatively for the purpose of caricature or pastiche).  The legislation does not define what is meant by "parody", but the UK IPO&nbsp;– the [[Intellectual Property Office (United Kingdom)]]&nbsp;– suggests<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/359250/Exceptions_to_copyright_-_Guidance_for_creators_and_copyright_owners.pdf|format=PDF|title=Exceptions to copyright : Guidance for creators and copyright owners|website=Gov.uk|accessdate=3 October 2018}}</ref> that a "parody" is something that imitates a work
for humorous or satirical effect.  See also [[Fair dealing in United Kingdom law]].

==Internet culture==
Parody is a prominent genre in online culture, thanks in part to the ease with which digital texts may be altered, appropriated, and shared. Japanese kuso and Chinese e'gao are emblematic of the importance of parody in online cultures in Asia. Video mash-ups and other parodic memes, such as humorously-altered Chinese characters, have been particularly popular as a tool for political protest in the People's Republic of China, the government of which maintains an extensive censorship apparatus.<ref>Christopher Rea, "Spoofing (e’gao) Culture on the Chinese Internet.” In Humour in Chinese Life and Culture: Resistance and Control in Modern Times. Jessica Milner Davis and Jocelyn Chey, eds. Hong Kong: Hong Kong University Press, 2013, pp. 149–172</ref> Chinese internet slang makes extensive use of puns and parodies on how Chinese characters are pronounced or written, as illustrated in the [https://chinadigitaltimes.net/space/Grass-Mud_Horse_Lexicon:_Browse_by_Topic Grass-Mud Horse Lexicon].

==Social and political uses==
[[File:I did not raise my girl to be a voter3.jpg|right|thumb|Satirical political cartoon that appeared in ''[[Puck (magazine)|Puck]]'' magazine, October 9, 1915. Caption "I did not raise my girl to be a voter" parodies the anti-[[World War I]] song "[[I Didn't Raise My Boy To Be A Soldier]]." A chorus of disreputable men support a lone anti-suffrage woman.]]

Parody is a frequent ingredient in [[satire]] and is often used to make social and political points. Examples include [[Jonathan Swift|Swift]]'s "[[A Modest Proposal]]", which satirized English neglect of Ireland by parodying emotionally disengaged political tracts; and, recently, ''[[The Daily Show]]'' and ''[[The Colbert Report]]'', which parody a news broadcast and a talk show to satirize political and social trends and events.

On the other hand, the writer and frequent parodist [[Vladimir Nabokov]] made a distinction: "Satire is a lesson, parody is a game."<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Appel | first1 = Alfred, Jr. | authorlink1 = Alfred Appel | last2 = Nabokov  | first2 = Vladimir | authorlink2 = Vladimir Nabokov | year = 1967 | title = An Interview with Vladimir Nabokov | journal = Wisconsin Studies in Contemporary Literature | volume = VIII | issue = 2 | pages = 127–152 | url = http://lib.ru/NABOKOW/Inter06.txt_with-big-pictures.html | accessdate = 28 Dec 2013}}</ref>

Some events, such as a national tragedy, can be difficult to handle. Chet Clem, Editorial Manager of the news parody publication ''[[The Onion]]'', told ''[[Wikinews]]'' in an interview the questions that are raised when addressing difficult topics:
{{cquote|I know the [[September 11 attacks|September 11]] issue was an obviously very large challenge to approach.  Do we even put out an issue?  What is funny at this time in American history?  Where are the jokes?  Do people want jokes right now?  Is the nation ready to laugh again?  Who knows.  There will always be some level of division in the back room.  It’s also what keeps us on our toes.<ref name=DS>[[n:The Onion: An interview with 'America's Finest News Source'|An interview with The Onion]], David Shankbone, ''[[Wikinews]]'', November 25, 2007.</ref>}}

Parody is by no means necessarily satirical, and may sometimes be done with respect and appreciation of the subject involved, without being a heedless sarcastic attack.

Parody has also been used to facilitate dialogue between cultures or subcultures. Sociolinguist [[Mary Louise Pratt]] identifies parody as one of the "arts of the contact zone", through which marginalized or oppressed groups "selectively appropriate", or imitate and take over, aspects of more empowered cultures.<ref>Pratt (1991)</ref>

Shakespeare often uses a series of parodies to convey his meaning. In the social context of his era, an example can be seen in ''[[King Lear]]'' where the [[Jester|fool]] is introduced with his [[Comb (anatomy)#Other|coxcomb]] to be a parody of the king.
