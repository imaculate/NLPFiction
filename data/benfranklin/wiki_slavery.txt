'''Slavery''' is any system in which principles of [[property law]] are applied to people, allowing individuals to own, buy and sell other individuals, as a ''[[de jure]]'' form of [[property]].<ref>{{cite book|first=Laura|last=Brace|title=The Politics of Property: Labour, Freedom and Belonging|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=osZnIiqDd4sC|page=162}}|accessdate=May 31, 2012|year=2004|publisher=Edinburgh University Press|isbn=978-0-7486-1535-3|pages=162–}}</ref> A slave is unable to withdraw unilaterally from such an arrangement and works without [[remuneration]]. Many scholars now use the term [[Slavery#Types|chattel slavery]] to refer to this specific sense of legalised, ''de jure'' slavery. In a broader sense, however, the word slavery may also refer to any situation in which an individual is ''[[de facto]]'' forced to work against their own will. Scholars also use the more generic terms such as [[unfree labour]] or [[forced labour]] to refer to such situations.<ref name="newint"/>  However, and especially under slavery in broader senses of the word, slaves may have some rights and protections according to laws or customs.

Slavery began to exist before written history, in many [[culture]]s.<ref name="Slavery"/> A person could become enslaved from the time of their birth, capture, or purchase.

==Terminology==
The English word ''slave'' comes from [[Old French]] ''sclave'', from the [[Medieval Latin]] ''sclavus'', from the [[Byzantine Greek]] σκλάβος, which, in turn, comes from the ethnonym [[Slav#Ethnonym|''Slav'']], because in some early Medieval wars many Slavs were captured and enslaved.<ref>''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'', 2nd edition 1989, ''s. v.'' 'slave'</ref><ref>[https://www.britannica.com/topic/history-of-Europe/The-bishops-of-Rome#toc276189 "History of Europe – Middle Ages – Growth and innovation – Demographic and agricultural growth"], ''Encyclopædia Britannica''.</ref> An older interpretation connected it to the Greek verb ''skyleúo'' 'to strip a slain enemy'.<ref name="Kluge">Kluge, F. ''Etymologisches Wörterbuch der deutschen Sprache''. 1891, ''s.v.'' "Sklave".</ref>

There is a dispute among historians about whether terms such as "unfree labourer" or "enslaved person", rather than "slave", should be used when describing the victims of slavery. According to those proposing a change in terminology, "slave" perpetuates the crime of slavery in language, by reducing its victims to a nonhuman noun instead of, according to Andi Cumbo-Floyd, "carry[ing] them forward as people, not the property that they were". Other historians prefer "slave" because the term is familiar and shorter, or because it accurately reflects the inhumanity of slavery, with "person" implying a degree of autonomy that slavery does not allow for.<ref>{{cite magazine |last1=Waldman |first1=Katy |date=19 May 2015 |title=Slave or Enslaved Person?

===Chattel slavery===
Chattel slavery, also called traditional slavery, is so named because people are treated as the [[personal property|chattel]] (personal property) of the owner and are bought and sold as commodities. Typically, under the chattel slave system, slave status was imposed on children of the enslaved at birth.<ref>{{Cite book |title=Slavery in the Modern World |last=Frost |first=Dan |publisher=ABC-CLIO |year=2011 |isbn=978-1-85109-783-8 |editor-last=Rodriguez |editor-first=Junius P. |volume=1 |page=182 |chapter=Chattel Slavery}}</ref> Although it dominated many different societies throughout human history, this form of slavery has been formally abolished and is very rare today.

[[Unfree labour|Forced labour]], or unfree labour, is sometimes used to refer to when an individual is forced to work against their own will, under threat of violence or other punishment, but the generic term unfree labour is also used to describe chattel slavery, as well as any other situation in which a person is obliged to work against their own will and a person's ability to work productively is under the complete control of another person.<ref name="newint"/> This may also include institutions not commonly classified as slavery, such as [[serfdom]], [[conscription]] and [[penal labour]]. While some unfree labourers, such as [[serf]]s, have substantive, ''[[de jure]]'' legal or traditional rights, they also have no ability to terminate the arrangements under which they work, and are frequently subject to forms of coercion, violence, and restrictions on their activities and movement outside their place of work.

Human trafficking primarily involves women and children forced into [[prostitution]] and is the fastest growing form of forced labour, with Thailand, Cambodia, India, Brazil and Mexico having been identified as leading hotspots of [[commercial sexual exploitation of children]].<ref name="newint"/><ref name=voa>{{cite web|url=http://www1.voanews.com/english/news/a-13-2009-05-15-voa30-68815957.html?rss=human+rights+and+law |title=Experts encourage action against sex trafficking |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091223080032/http://www1.voanews.com/english/news/a-13-2009-05-15-voa30-68815957.html?rss=human%2Brights%2Band%2Blaw |archivedate=December 23, 2009 |deadurl=yes |df= }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ipsnews.net/2007/08/rights-mexico-16000-victims-of-child-sexual-exploitation/|title=Rights–Mexico: 16,000 Victims of Child Sexual Exploitation|website=ipsnews.net|accessdate=February 11, 2016}}</ref> Examples of [[sexual slavery]], often in military contexts, include detention in "rape camps" or "comfort stations," "[[comfort women]]", forced "marriages" to soldiers and other practices involving the treatment of women or men as chattel and, as such, violations of the peremptory norm prohibiting slavery.<ref name="iclklamberg.com">{{Citation| title=Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court |publisher=International Criminal Law Database & Commentary |page= footnotes: [http://www.iclklamberg.com/Statute.htm#_ftn29 29], 82, 107}}</ref><ref name="juridicas.unam.mx">{{cite journal |last1=Acuña |first1=Tathiana Flores |date=January 2004 |title=The Rome Statute's Sexual Related Crimes: an Appraisal under the Light of International Humanitarian Law |url=http://www.juridicas.unam.mx/publica/librev/rev/iidh/cont/39/pr/pr7.pdf |journal=Revista Instituto Interamericano de Derechos Humanos |volume=1 |issue=39 |pages=29–30 |format=PDF |accessdate=July 8, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/ethics/slavery/modern/modern_1.shtml#section_2|title=Ethics – Slavery: Modern slavery|website=bbc.co.uk|accessdate=February 11, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Report of the Special Rapporteur on contemporary forms of  slavery, including its causes and consequences,  Gulnara Shahinian|url=http://www.ohchr.org/Documents/HRBodies/HRCouncil/RegularSession/Session21/A-HRC-21-41_en.pdf|website=ohchr.org|publisher=United Nations Human Rights Council|accessdate=October 14, 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130921060954/http://www.ohchr.org/Documents/HRBodies/HRCouncil/RegularSession/Session21/A-HRC-21-41_en.pdf|archivedate=September 21, 2013 |format=PDF|date=10 July 2012}}</ref>

===Economics===
[[File:Boulanger Gustave Clarence Rudolphe The Slave Market.jpg|thumb|right|[[Gustave Boulanger]]'s painting ''[[The Slave Market (Boulanger painting)|The Slave Market]]'']]

Economists have attempted to model the circumstances under which slavery (and variants such as [[serfdom]]) appear and disappear. One observation is that slavery becomes more desirable for landowners where land is abundant but labour is scarce, such that rent is depressed and paid workers can demand high wages. If the opposite holds true, then it becomes more costly for landowners to have guards for the slaves than to employ paid workers who can only demand low wages due to the amount of competition.<ref>{{cite journal|last=North|first=Douglass C.|author2=Robert Paul Thomas |title=The Rise and Fall of the Manorial System: A Theoretical Model|journal=The Journal of Economic History|date=December 1971|volume=31|issue=4|pages=777–803|jstor=2117209|doi=10.1017/S0022050700074623}}</ref> Thus, first slavery and then serfdom gradually decreased in Europe as the population grew, but were reintroduced in the Americas and in Russia as large areas of new land with few people became available.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Domar|first=Evsey D.|title=The Causes of Slavery or Serfdom: A Hypothesis|journal=The Journal of Economic History|date=March 1970|volume=30|issue=1|pages=18–32|jstor=2116721}}</ref>

Slavery is more common when the labor done is relatively simple and thus easy to supervise, such as large-scale growing of a single crop, like sugar and cotton, in which output was based on [[economies of scale]]. This enables such systems of labor, such as the [[gang system]] in the United States, to become prominent on large plantations where field hands were monitored and worked with factory-like precision.

For example, each work gang was based on an internal division of labour that not only assigned every member of the gang to a precise task, but also simultaneously made their own performance dependent on the actions of the others. The hoe hands chopped out the weeds that surrounded the cotton plants as well as excessive sprouts. The plow gangs followed behind, stirring the soil near the rows of cotton plants and tossing it back around the plants. Thus, the gang system worked like an [[assembly line]].<ref>{{cite web|author=Lagerlöf, Nils-Petter |url=https://ideas.repec.org/p/pra/mprapa/372.html |title=Slavery and other property rights |publisher=Ideas. repec.org |date=November 12, 2006 |accessdate=May 6, 2009}}</ref>

Since the 18th century, critics have argued that slavery tends to retard technological advancement because the focus is on increasing the number of slaves doing simple tasks rather than upgrading the efficiency of labour. For example, it is sometime argued that, because of this narrow focus, theoretical knowledge and learning in Greece – and later in Rome – was not applied to ease physical labour or improve manufacturing.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.history.com/encyclopedia.do?articleId=223811|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080423152702/http://www.history.com/encyclopedia.do?articleId=223811|archivedate=April 23, 2008 |title=Technology |publisher=History.com |date=January 4, 2008 |accessdate=May 6, 2009}}</ref>

[[Adam Smith]] made the argument that free labour was economically better than slave labour, and that it is nearly impossible to end slavery in a free, democratic, or republican form of government since many of its legislators, or political figures were slave owners, and would not punish themselves.  He further argued that slaves would be better able to gain their freedom when there was centralized government, or a central authority like a king or the church.<ref>{{cite book|author1=John R. McKivigan|author2=Mitchell Snay|title=Religion and the Antebellum Debate Over Slavery|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=e-unV4v5puYC|page=68}}|accessdate=May 31, 2012|year=1998|publisher=University of Georgia Press|isbn=978-0-8203-2076-2|pages=68–}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|first=Charles L. |last=Griswold|title=Adam Smith and the Virtues of Enlightenment|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=WRcU_GJAc9gC|page=198}}|accessdate=May 31, 2012|year=1999|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-62891-4|pages=198–}}</ref>

Similar arguments appear later in the works of [[Auguste Comte]], especially when it comes to Adam Smith's belief in the [[separation of powers]], or what Comte called the "separation of the spiritual and the temporal" during the Middle Ages and the end of slavery, and Smith's criticism of masters, past and present. As Smith stated in the [[Lectures on Jurisprudence]], "The great power of the clergy thus concurring with that of the king set the slaves at liberty. But it was absolutely necessary both that the authority of the king and of the clergy should be great. Where ever any one of these was wanting, slavery still continues..."

[[File:The inspection and sale of a slave.jpg|thumb|Sale and inspection of slaves]]
Slaves can be an attractive investment because the slave-owner only needs to pay for sustenance and enforcement. This is sometimes lower than the wage-cost of free laborers because free workers earn more than sustenance, resulting in slaves having a positive price. When the cost of sustenance and enforcement exceeds the wage rate, slave-owning would no longer be profitable, and owners would simply release their slaves. Slaves are thus a more attractive investment in high-wage, cheap-enforcement environments, and less attractive in low-wage-rate, expensive-enforcement environments.<ref name="Bryan Caplan">{{cite web|url=http://econfaculty.gmu.edu/bcaplan/e321/lab3old.htm|title=Economics of Slavery Lecture Notes|first=Bryan|last=Caplan|access-date=July 8, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130828005832/http://econfaculty.gmu.edu/bcaplan/e321/lab3old.htm|archive-date=August 28, 2013|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}</ref>

Free workers also earn [[compensating differential]]s, whereby they are paid more for doing unpleasant work.  However, since neither sustenance nor enforcement costs rise with the unpleasantness of the work, the cost of slaves  do not rise by the same amount. As such, slaves are more attractive for unpleasant work, and less attractive for pleasant work. Because the unpleasantness of the work is not internalised, being borne by the slave rather than the owner, it is a [[negative externality]] and leads to over-use of slaves in these situations.<ref name="Bryan Caplan"/>

Currently, the weighted average global sales price of a slave is calculated to be approximately $340, with a high of $1,895 for the average trafficked sex slave, and a low of $40 to $50 for debt bondage slaves in part of Asia and Africa.<ref name="Dhaliwal"/>

Worldwide slavery is a criminal offense but slave owners can get very high returns for their risk. According to researcher [[Siddharth Kara]], the profits generated worldwide by all forms of slavery in 2007 were $91.2 billion. That is second only to drug trafficking, in terms of global criminal enterprises. The weighted average annual profits generated by a slave in 2007 was $3,175, with a low of an average $950 for bonded labor and $29,210 for a trafficked sex slave.<ref name="Dhaliwal">{{Cite book|last=Kara |first= Siddharth|title=Sex Trafficking – Inside the Business of Modern Slavery |publisher= Columbia University Press|date= 2008|isbn=978-0-231-13960-1}}</ref> Approximately 40% of slave profits each year are generated by trafficked sex slaves, representing slightly more than 4% of the world's 29 million slaves.<ref name="Dhaliwal"/>

[[Robert E. Wright]] has developed a [[Conceptual model|model]], based on economic conditions, that helps to predict when firms (individuals, companies) will be more likely to use slaves rather than wage workers, [[indentured servants]], family members, or other types of [[Laborer|labourers]].<ref>Robert E.

===Identification===
[[File:Slavery17.jpg|thumb|[[Human branding#Branding in American slavery|Slave branding]], c. 1853.]]
Throughout history, slaves were clothed in a distinctive fashion, particularly with respect to footwear, or rather the lack thereof. This was due to economic reasons, as well as a distinguishing feature, especially in South Africa and South America. For example, the [[Cape Town]] slave code stated that ''"Slaves must go barefoot and must carry passes."''<ref name="WCG">{{cite web|title=Cape Town and Surrounds|url=https://www.westerncape.gov.za/general-publication/places-slave-rememberance-western-cape?toc_page=3|publisher=westerncape.gov.za|accessdate=July 18, 2012}}</ref>

This was the case in the majority of states that abolished slavery later in history, as most images from the respective historical period suggest that slaves were barefoot.<ref name="slavery_brazil">{{cite web|title=Slavery in Brazil|url=http://histclo.com/act/work/slave/am/cou/bra/sab-sla.html|publisher=Historical Boys' Clothing|accessdate=July 18, 2012}}</ref>
To quote Brother Riemer (1779): "[the slaves] are, even in their most beautiful suit, obliged to go barefoot. Slaves were forbidden to wear shoes. This was a prime mark of distinction between the free and the bonded and no exceptions were permitted."<ref name="living_conditions">{{cite web|title=Living conditions of slaves|url=http://surinamslavery.blogspot.com/2008/10/chapter-6-living-conditions-of-slaves.html|publisher=Historical Boys' Clothing|accessdate=July 18, 2012}}</ref>

As shoes have been considered badges of freedom since biblical times ''"But the father said to his servants, Bring forth the best robe, and put [it] on him; and put a ring on his hand, and shoes on [his] feet ({{bibleverse|Luke|15:22|KJV}})"'' this aspect has been an informal law wherever slavery existed. A barefoot person could therefore be clearly identified as a slave upon first sight.{{Original research inline|date=December 2018}}

Some historians assert that as many as 17 million people were sold into slavery on the coast of the Indian Ocean, the Middle East, and North Africa, and approximately 5 million African slaves were bought by Muslim slave traders and taken from Africa across the Red Sea, Indian Ocean, and Sahara desert between 1500 and 1900.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/1523100.stm | title=Focus on the slave trade | publisher=BBC |date=3 September 2001 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170525101036/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/1523100.stm |archive-date=25 May 2017}}</ref>

The captives were sold throughout the Middle East. This trade accelerated as superior ships led to more trade and greater demand for labour on [[plantation]]s in the region.

The Indian Ocean slave trade was multi-directional and changed over time. To meet the demand for menial labor, Bantu slaves bought by Arab slave traders from southeastern Africa were sold in cumulatively large numbers over the centuries to customers in Egypt, Arabia, the Persian Gulf, India, European colonies in the Far East, the [[List of islands in the Indian Ocean|Indian Ocean islands]], Ethiopia and Somalia.<ref name="Gwyn">Gwyn Campbell, ''The Structure of Slavery in Indian Ocean Africa and Asia'', 1 edition, (Routledge: 2003), p. ix</ref>

Slave labor in East Africa was drawn from the ''Zanj,'' Bantu peoples that lived along the East African coast.<ref name="Ogot"/><ref name="Bagley">F.R.C. Bagley et al., ''The Last Great Muslim Empires'', (Brill: 1997), p. 174</ref> The Zanj were for centuries shipped as slaves by Arab traders to all the countries bordering the Indian Ocean. The Umayyad and Abbasid caliphs recruited many Zanj slaves as soldiers and, as early as 696, there were slave revolts of the Zanj against their Arab enslavers in Iraq.

The [[Zanj Rebellion]], a series of [[Rebellion|uprisings]] that took place between 869 and 883 AD near the city of [[Basra]] (also known as Basara), situated in present-day Iraq, is believed to have involved enslaved Zanj that had originally been captured from the [[African Great Lakes]] region and areas further south in [[East Africa]].<ref name="Esrrvt">{{cite book|last=Rodriguez|first=Junius P.|title=Encyclopedia of Slave Resistance and Rebellion, Volume 2|date=2007|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|isbn=978-0-313-33273-9|page=585|url=https://www.google.com/books?id=RXsBJzA61lcC}}</ref> It grew to involve over 500,000 slaves and free men who were imported from across the [[Muslim empire]] and claimed over "tens of thousands of lives in lower Iraq".<ref name="Furlonge">{{cite web|last=Asquith |first=Christina |url=https://www.questia.com/magazine/1G1-76402507/revisiting-the-zanj-and-re-visioning-revolt-complexities |title=Revisiting the Zanj and Re-Visioning Revolt: Complexities of the Zanj Conflict – 868–883 AD – slave revolt in Iraq |publisher=Questia.com |date= |accessdate=March 23, 2016}}</ref>

Davis' numbers have been refuted by other historians, such as David Earle, who cautions that true picture of Europeans slaves is clouded by the fact the corsairs also seized non-Christian whites from eastern Europe.<ref name=Earle/>

In addition, the number of slaves traded was hyperactive, with exaggerated estimates relying on peak years to calculate averages for entire centuries, or millennia.  Hence, there were wide fluctuations year-to-year, particularly in the 18th and 19th centuries, given slave imports, and also given the fact that, prior to the 1840s, there are no consistent records.

Such observations, across the late 1500s and early 1600s observers, account for around 35,000 European Christian slaves held throughout this period on the Barbary Coast, across Tripoli, Tunis, but mostly in Algiers. The majority were sailors (particularly those who were English), taken with their ships, but others were fishermen and coastal villagers.

Systems of servitude and slavery were common in parts of Africa, as they were in much of the [[Ancient history|ancient world]]. In many African societies where slavery was prevalent, the enslaved people were not treated as [[Slavery#Chattel slavery|chattel slaves]] and were given certain rights in a system similar to [[indentured servitude]] elsewhere in the world.

The forms of slavery in Africa were closely related to [[kinship]] structures. In many African communities, where land could not be owned, enslavement of individuals was used as a means to increase the influence a person had and expand connections.<ref name="Snell" /> This made slaves a permanent part of a master's lineage and the children of slaves could become closely connected with the larger family ties.<ref name="Lovejoy">{{Cite journal|last=Lovejoy|first=Paul E.|journal=Journal of African History|title=The Impact of the Atlantic Slave Trade on Africa: A Review of the Literature|year=1989|page=30}}</ref> Children of slaves born into families could be integrated into the master's kinship group and rise to prominent positions within society, even to the level of chief in some instances.

When the [[Atlantic slave trade]] began, many of the local slave systems began supplying captives for chattel slave markets outside Africa. Although the Atlantic slave trade was not the only slave trade from Africa, it was the largest in volume and intensity. As Elikia M’bokolo wrote in ''[[Le Monde diplomatique]]'':

{{quote|The African continent was bled of its human resources via all possible routes. Across the Sahara, through the Red Sea, from the Indian Ocean ports and across the Atlantic. At least ten centuries of slavery for the benefit of the [[Muslim world|Muslim countries]] (from the ninth to the nineteenth).... Four million enslaved people exported via the [[Red Sea]], another four million through the [[Swahili people|Swahili]] ports of the Indian Ocean, perhaps as many as nine million along the [[Trans-Saharan trade|trans-Saharan]] caravan route, and eleven to twenty million (depending on the author) across the Atlantic Ocean.<ref>M’bokolo, Elikia, [http://mondediplo.com/1998/04/02africa "The impact of the slave trade on Africa"], ''[[Le Monde diplomatique]]'', April 2, 1998.</ref>}}

The trans-Atlantic slave trade peaked in the late 18th century, when the largest number of slaves were captured on raiding expeditions into the interior of West Africa. These expeditions were typically carried out by [[List of kingdoms in pre-colonial Africa|African kingdoms]], such as the [[Oyo Empire|Oyo empire]] ([[Yoruba people|Yoruba]]), the [[Ashanti Empire]],<ref>"[https://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/23/opinion/23gates.html Ending the Slavery Blame-Game]", ''[[The New York Times]]'', April 22, 2010.</ref> the kingdom of [[Dahomey]],<ref>[http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/slav/hd_slav.htm The Transatlantic Slave Trade] Alexander Ives Bortolot.

Slavery in America remains a contentious issue and played a major role in the history and evolution of some countries, triggering a [[Haitian Revolution|revolution]], [[American Civil War|a civil war]], and numerous rebellions.

In order to establish itself as an American empire, Spain had to fight against the relatively powerful civilizations of the [[New World]]. The [[Spanish people|Spanish]] conquest of the indigenous peoples in the Americas included using the Natives as forced labour. The [[Slavery in the Spanish New World colonies|Spanish colonies]] were the first Europeans to use African slaves in the New World on islands such as [[Cuba]] and [[Hispaniola]] (see [[Atlantic slave trade]].)<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/fields/2028.html?countryName=Haiti&countryCode=ha&regionCode=ca&#ha|title=The World Factbook|website=cia.gov}}</ref> [[Bartolomé de las Casas]], a 16th-century [[Dominican Order|Dominican]] [[friar]] and [[Spanish people|Spanish]] historian, participated in campaigns in Cuba (at [[Bayamo]] and [[Camagüey]]) and was present at the massacre of [[Hatuey]]; his observation of that massacre led him to fight for a social movement away from the use of natives as slaves. Also, the alarming decline in the [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|native]] population had spurred the first royal laws protecting the native population ([[Laws of Burgos|Laws of Burgos, 1512–1513]]).

The first African slaves arrived in Hispaniola in 1501.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ukcouncilhumanrights.co.uk/webbook-chap1.html |title=Health In Slavery |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061003165601/http://www.ukcouncilhumanrights.co.uk/webbook-chap1.html |archivedate=October 3, 2006}}</ref> England played a prominent role in the [[Atlantic slave trade]]. The "[[Triangular trade#Atlantic triangular slave trade|slave triangle]]" was pioneered by [[Francis Drake]] and his associates.

Many Europeans who arrived in North America during the 17th and 18th centuries came under contract as indentured servants.<ref>[http://mertsahinoglu.com/research/indentured-servitude-colonial-america/ Indentured Servitude in Colonial America]. Deanna Barker, ''Frontier Resources''.</ref> The transformation from indentured servitude to slavery was a gradual process in Virginia. The earliest legal documentation of such a shift was in 1640 where a negro, [[John Punch (slave)|John Punch]], was sentenced to lifetime slavery, forcing him to serve his master, Hugh Gwyn, for the remainder of his life, for attempting to run away. This case was significant because it established the disparity between his sentence as a black man, and that of the two white indentured servants who escaped with him (one described as Dutch and one as a Scotchman). It is the first documented case of a black man sentenced to lifetime servitude, and is considered one of the first legal cases to make a racial distinction between black and white indentured servants.<ref name="LLC">[http://memory.loc.gov/ammem/awhhtml/awlaw3/slavery.html Slavery and Indentured Servants] [[Law Library of Congress]]</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.virtualjamestown.org/practise.html |title=Slave Laws |publisher=Virtual Jamestown |date= |accessdate=November 4, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book |title=Out of the Land of Bondage": The English Revolution and the Atlantic Origins of Abolition |first=John |last=Donoghue |work=The American Historical Review|year=2010 |url=http://ahr.oxfordjournals.org/content/115/4/943.full.pdf+html?sid=dc069c4e-7758-487c-a4d7-4d23f203e0df}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book |title=In the Matter of Color: Race and the American Legal Process: The Colonial Period |first=A.

After 1640, planters started to ignore the expiration of indentured contracts and kept their servants as slaves for life. This was demonstrated by the 1655 case ''Johnson v.

====Barbados====
[[File:Bussa statue.png|thumb|upright|[[Bussa Emancipation Statue|Statue of Bussa]], who led the largest slave rebellion in Barbadian history.]]
In the very early years (1620–1640s) the majority of the labour was provided by European indentured servants, mainly [[English people|English]], [[Irish people|Irish]] and [[Scottish people|Scottish]], with [[Atlantic slave trade|enslaved Africans]] and enslaved Amerindian  providing little of the workforce.

The introduction of [[sugar cane]] from [[Dutch Brazil]] in 1640 completely transformed society and the economy. Barbados eventually had one of the world's biggest sugar industries.<ref name=beyond>{{Cite book |authorlink=Arif Ali |author=Ali, Arif |title=Barbados: Just Beyond Your Imagination |pages=46, 48 |year=1997 |publisher=Hansib Publishing (Caribbean) Ltd |isbn=978-1-870518-54-3 }}</ref>

As the effects of the new crop increased, so did the shift in the ethnic composition of Barbados and surrounding islands. The workable sugar plantation required a large investment and a great deal of heavy labour. At first, Dutch traders supplied the equipment, financing, and enslaved Africans, in addition to transporting most of the sugar to Europe. In 1644 the population of Barbados was estimated at 30,000, of which about 800 were of African descent, with the remainder mainly of English descent. These English smallholders were eventually bought out and the island filled up with large sugar plantations worked by enlslaved Africans. By 1660 there was near parity with 27,000 blacks and 26,000 whites. By 1666 at least 12,000 white smallholders had been bought out, died, or left the island. Many of the remaining whites were increasingly poor. By 1680 there were 17 slaves for every indentured servant. By 1700, there were 15,000 free whites and 50,000 enslaved Africans.

Due to the increased implementation of [[Barbados Slave Code|slave codes]], which created differential treatment between Africans and the white workers and ruling planter class, the island became increasingly unattractive to [[redlegs|poor whites]]. Black or slave codes were implemented in 1661, 1676, 1682, and 1688. In response to these codes, several slave rebellions were attempted or planned during this time, but none succeeded. Nevertheless, poor whites who had or acquired the means to emigrate often did so. Planters expanded their importation of enslaved Africans to cultivate sugar cane.

====Brazil====

[[File:Jacques Etienne Arago - Castigo de Escravos, 1839.jpg|thumb|upright|''Slave punishment'' by [[Jacques Arago|Jacques Etienne Arago]], 1839.]]

Slavery in Brazil began long before the [[Colonial Brazil|first Portuguese settlement]] was established in 1532, as members of one tribe would enslave captured members of another.<ref name="dominiopublico.gov.br">[http://www.dominiopublico.gov.br/download/texto/me003015.pdf Sousa, Gabriel Soars. Tratado Descritivo do Brasil em 1587]</ref>

Later, Portuguese colonists were heavily dependent on indigenous labor during the initial phases of settlement to maintain the subsistence economy, and natives were often captured by expeditions called ''{{lang|pt|bandeiras}}''. The importation of African slaves began midway through the 16th century, but the enslavement of indigenous peoples continued well into the 17th and 18th centuries.

During the [[Atlantic slave trade]] era, Brazil imported more African slaves than any other country. Nearly 5 million slaves were brought from Africa to Brazil during the period from 1501 to 1866.<ref>{{cite web|title=Vergonha Ainda Maior: Novas informações disponíveis em um enorme banco de dados mostram que a escravidão no Brasil foi muito pior do que se sabia antes (|url=http://veja.abril.com.br/blog/ricardo-setti/tema-livre/vergonha-ainda-maior-novas-informacoes-disponiveis-em-um-enorme-banco-de-dados-mostram-que-a-escravidao-no-brasil-foi-muito-pior-do-que-se-sabia-antes/|website=Veja|accessdate=16 March 2015|language=Portuguese|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150313000755/http://veja.abril.com.br/blog/ricardo-setti/tema-livre/vergonha-ainda-maior-novas-informacoes-disponiveis-em-um-enorme-banco-de-dados-mostram-que-a-escravidao-no-brasil-foi-muito-pior-do-que-se-sabia-antes/|archivedate=March 13, 2015|df=mdy-all}}</ref> Until the early 1850s, most enslaved Africans who arrived on Brazilian shores were forced to embark at West Central African ports, especially in [[Luanda]] (present-day [[Angola]]). Today, with the exception of Nigeria, the largest population of people of African descent is in Brazil.<ref name="cambriapress.com">African Heritage and Memories of Slavery in Brazil and the South Atlantic World [http://www.cambriapress.com/books/9781604978926.cfm]</ref>

Slave labor was the driving force behind the growth of the [[Sugarcane|sugar]] economy in Brazil, and sugar was the primary export of the colony from 1600 to 1650. [[Gold]] and [[diamond]] deposits were discovered in Brazil in 1690, which sparked an increase in the importation of African slaves to power this newly profitable market. Transportation systems were developed for the mining infrastructure, and population boomed from immigrants seeking to take part in gold and diamond mining.

The largest number of slaves were shipped to Brazil.<ref>Stephen D. Behrendt, David Richardson, and David Eltis, [[W. E. B. Du Bois Institute|W. E. B. Du Bois Institute for African and African-American Research]], [[Harvard University]]. Based on "records for 27,233 voyages that set out to obtain slaves for the Americas". {{Cite book|last=Stephen Behrendt |title=Africana: The Encyclopedia of the African and African American Experience |year=1999 |publisher=Basic Civitas Books |location=New York |isbn=978-0-465-00071-5 |chapter=Transatlantic Slave Trade |quote=}}</ref>

Demand for African slaves did not wane after the decline of the mining industry in the second half of the 18th century. Cattle ranching and foodstuff production proliferated after the population growth, both of which relied heavily on slave labor. 1.7 million slaves were imported to Brazil from Africa from 1700 to 1800, and the rise of coffee in the 1830s further enticed expansion of the slave trade.

Brazil was the last country in the Western world to abolish slavery. By the time it was abolished, in 1888, an estimated four million slaves had been imported from Africa to Brazil, 40% of the total number of slaves brought to the Americas. For reference, the United States received 10 percent.

Despite being abolished, there are still people working in slavery-like conditions in Brazil in the 21st century.

====Cuba====
In 1789 the Spanish Crown led an effort to reform slavery, as the demand for slave labor in Cuba was growing. The Crown issued a decree, ''Código Negro Español'' (Spanish Black Codex), that specified food and clothing provisions, put limits on the number of [[work hours]], limited punishments, required religious instruction, and protected marriages, forbidding the sale of young children away from their mothers.<ref name=Childs>{{cite book|last=Childs|first=Matt D.|title=1812 Aponte Rebellion in Cuba and the Struggle against Atlantic Slavery|year=2006|publisher=University of North Carolina Press|isbn=978-0-8078-5772-4}}</ref> The British made other changes to the institution of slavery in Cuba.<ref name=Childs/> But, planters often flouted the laws and protested against them, considering them a threat to their authority<ref name=Childs/> and an intrusion into their personal lives.<ref name=Childs/>

The slaveowners did not protest against all the measures of the codex, many of which they argued were already common practices. They objected to efforts to set limits on their ability to apply physical punishment. For instance, the Black Codex limited [[Flagellation|whippings]] to 25 and required the whippings "not to cause serious bruises or bleeding".<ref name=Childs/> The slave-owners thought that the slaves would interpret these limits as weaknesses, ultimately leading to resistance.<ref name=Childs/> Another contested issue was the work hours that were restricted "from sunrise to sunset"; plantation owners responded by explaining that cutting and processing of cane needed 20-hour days during the harvest season.<ref name=Childs/>

Those slaves who worked on sugar plantations and in sugar mills were often subject to the harshest of conditions. The field work was rigorous manual labor which the slaves began at an early age. The work days lasted close to 20 hours during harvest and processing, including cultivating and cutting the crops, hauling wagons, and processing sugarcane with dangerous machinery. The slaves were forced to reside in [[barracoons]], where they were crammed in and locked in by a padlock at night, getting about three and four hours of sleep.  The conditions of the barracoons were harsh; they were highly unsanitary and extremely hot. Typically there was no ventilation; the only window was a small barred hole in the wall.<ref name="Montejo pp. 80-82">Montejo pp. 80–82</ref>

[[File:Slaves Unloading Ice in Cuba 1832.jpg|thumb|Slaves in Cuba unloading ice from [[Maine]], 1832]]
Cuba's slavery system was gendered in a way that some duties were performed only by male slaves, some only by female slaves. Female slaves in the city of [[Havana]], from the sixteenth century onwards, performed duties such as operating the town taverns, eating houses, and lodges, as well as being laundresses and domestic laborers and servants. Female slaves also served as the town prostitutes.

Some Cuban women could gain freedom by having children with white men. As in other Latin cultures, there were looser borders with the mulatto or mixed-race population. Sometimes men who took slaves as wives or concubines freed both them and their children. As in New Orleans and Saint-Domingue, mulattos began to be classified as a third group between the European colonists and African slaves. [[Freedmen]], generally of mixed race, came to represent 20% of the total Cuban population and 41% of the non-white Cuban population.<ref name="Knight pp. 144–5">Knight pp. 144–45</ref>

But, planters encouraged Afro-Cuban slaves to have children in order to reproduce their work force. The masters wanted to pair strong and large-built black men with healthy black women. They were placed in the barracoons and forced to have sex and create offspring of “breed stock” children, who would sell for around 500 pesos. The planters needed children to be born to replace slaves who died under the harsh regime. Sometimes if the overseers did not like the quality of children, they separate the parents and sent the mother back to working in the fields.<ref name="Montejo p. 39">Montejo p. 39</ref>

Both women and men were subject to the punishments of violence and humiliating abuse. Slaves who misbehaved or disobeyed their masters were often placed in stocks in the depths of the boiler houses where they were abandoned for days at a time, and oftentimes two to three months. These wooden stocks were made in two types: lying-down or stand-up types. women were punished, even when pregnant. They were subjected to whippings: they had to lay "face down over a scooped-out piece of round [earth] to protect their bellies." <ref name="Montejo p. 40">Montejo p. 40</ref> Some masters reportedly whipped pregnant women in the belly, often causing miscarriages. The wounds were treated with “compresses of tobacco leaves, urine and salt." <ref name="Montejo pp. 39–40">Montejo pp. 39–40</ref>

====Haiti====
{{Main|Slavery in Haiti}}
Slavery in Haiti started with the arrival of [[Christopher Columbus]] on the island in 1492. The practice was devastating to the native population. Following the indigenous Taino's near decimation from forced labour, disease and war, the Spanish, under advisement of the Catholic priest Bartolomeu de las Casas, and with the blessing of the Catholic church began engaging in earnest in the kidnapped and forced labour of enslaved Africans. During the [[French colonial empire|French colonial period]] beginning in 1625, the economy of Haiti (then known as [[Saint-Domingue]]) was based on slavery, and the practice there was regarded as the most brutal in the world.

Following the [[Treaty of Ryswick]] of 1697, [[Hispaniola]] was divided between [[Kingdom of France|France]] and [[Imperial Spain|Spain]].  France received the western third and subsequently named it [[Saint-Domingue]].  To develop it into sugarcane plantations, the French imported thousands of slaves from [[Africa]]. Sugar was a lucrative [[commodity crop]] throughout the 18th century. By 1789, approximately 40,000 white colonists lived in Saint-Domingue. In contrast, by 1763 the white population of [[New France|French Canada]], a vast territory, had numbered 65,000.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://faculty.marianopolis.edu/c.belanger/QuebecHistory/encyclopedia/ImmigrationHistoryofCanada.htm |title=Immigration History of Canada |publisher=Faculty.marianopolis.edu |accessdate=July 24, 2013}}</ref> The whites were vastly outnumbered by the tens of thousands of African slaves they had imported to work on their plantations, which were primarily devoted to the production of sugarcane. In the north of the island, slaves were able to retain many ties to African cultures, religion and language; these ties were continually being renewed by newly imported Africans. Blacks outnumbered whites by about ten to one.

The French-enacted ''[[Code Noir]]'' ("Black Code"), prepared by [[Jean-Baptiste Colbert]] and ratified by [[Louis XIV]], had established rules on slave treatment and permissible freedoms. Saint-Domingue has been described as one of the most brutally efficient slave colonies; one-third of newly imported Africans died within a few years.<ref name="Farmer-LROB">{{cite news |author= Farmer, Paul | title=Who removed Aristide? | pages=28–31 |accessdate= February 19, 2010 |date=April 15, 2004 |url=http://www.lrb.co.uk/v26/n08/farm01_.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080608222428/http://www.lrb.co.uk/v26/n08/farm01_.html |archivedate=June 8, 2008 | newspaper=London Review of Books }}</ref> Many slaves died from diseases such as [[smallpox]] and [[typhoid fever]].<ref>{{Cite book |author = Kiple, Kenneth F. | title = The Caribbean Slave: A Biological History | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=veMLoyrX0BEC&pg=&dq#v=onepage&q=&f | publisher = Cambridge University Press | year = 2002 | page = 145 | isbn = 978-0-521-52470-4 }}</ref> They had [[birth rate]]s around 3 percent, and there is evidence that some women [[abortion|aborted]] fetuses, or committed [[infanticide]], rather allow their children to live within the bonds of slavery.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/271908601|title=Women and Slavery|last=Gwyn Campbell,  Suzanne Miers, and Joseph C.

As in its [[Louisiana (New France)|Louisiana colony]], the [[New France|French colonial]] government allowed some rights to [[free people of color]]: the [[mixed-race]] descendants of white male colonists and black female slaves (and later, mixed-race women). Over time, many were released from slavery. They established a separate [[social class]]. White French [[Creole peoples|Creole]] fathers frequently sent their mixed-race sons to France for their education. Some men of color were admitted into the military. More of the free people of color lived in the south of the island, near [[Port-au-Prince]], and many intermarried within their community. They frequently worked as artisans and tradesmen, and began to own some property. Some became slave holders. The [[free people of color]] petitioned the [[New France|colonial]] government to expand their rights.

Slaves that made it to Haiti from the trans-Atlantic journey and slaves born in Haiti were first documented in Haiti's archives and transferred to France's Ministry of Defense and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. {{As of|2015}}, these records are in The National Archives of France. According to the 1788 Census, Haiti's population consisted of nearly 40,000 whites, 30,000 free coloureds and 450,000 slaves.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Coupeau| first=Steeve|title=The History of Haiti|url= https://books.google.com/?id=tA-XfYZFNvkC&pg=PA18&lpg=PA18&dq=haiti+1788+Census#v=onepage&q=haiti%201788%20Census&f=false|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|year=2008|page=18| isbn=978-0-313-34089-5}}</ref>

The [[Haitian Revolution]] of 1804, the only successful [[slave rebellion|slave revolt]] in human history, precipitated the end of slavery in all French colonies.

====Jamaica====
[[File:Slaves working on a plantation - Ten Views in the Island of Antigua (1823), plate III - BL.jpg|thumb|Planting the sugar cane, [[British West Indies]], 1823]]
The Caribbean island of Jamaica was colonized by the [[Taino]] tribes prior to the arrival of [[Christopher Columbus|Columbus]] in 1494.

The Spanish enslaved many of the Taino; some escaped, but most died from European diseases and overwork. The Spaniards also introduced the first African slaves.<ref name=discja>{{cite web|title=JAMAICAN HISTORY I |url=http://www.discoverjamaica.com/gleaner/discover/geography/history1.htm |publisher=Discover Jamaica |accessdate=August 23, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130805083846/http://www.discoverjamaica.com/gleaner/discover/geography/history1.htm |archivedate=August 5, 2013 |df= }}</ref>

The Spanish colonists did not bring women in the first expeditions and took Taíno women for their common-law wives, resulting in [[mestizo]] children.<ref>{{cite web|last=Guitar|first=Lynne|title=Criollos: The Birth of a Dynamic New Indo-Afro-European People and Culture on Hispaniola|url=http://www.kacike.org/LynneGuitar.html|website=KACIKE: Journal of Caribbean Amerindian History and Anthropology|accessdate=May 27, 2011 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081202053219/http://www.kacike.org/LynneGuitar.html |archivedate=December 2, 2008}}</ref>  Sexual violence with the Taíno women by the Spanish was also common.{{sfn|Léger|1907|p=23}}{{sfn|Accilien et al.|2003|p=12}}

Although the African slave population in the 1670s and 1680s never exceeded 10,000, by 1800 it had increased to over 300,000.

====Mexico====
In 1519, [[Hernán Cortés]] brought the first [[Afro-Mexican#African slavery in Mexico|modern slave]] to the area.<ref name=World>{{cite book|last=Agurilar-Moreno|first=Manuel|title=Handbook to Life in the Aztec World|year=2006|publisher=California State University, Los Angeles}}</ref>

In the mid-16th century, the second viceroy to Mexico, Luis de Velasco, prohibited slavery of the [[Aztecs]].  A labor shortage resulted as the Aztecs were either killed or died due to disease.  This led to the African slaves being imported, as they were not susceptible to [[smallpox]].  In exchange, many Africans were afforded the opportunity to buy their freedom, while eventually, others were granted their freedom by their masters.<ref name=World/>

====Puerto Rico====
When Ponce de León and the Spaniards arrived on the island of [[Puerto Rico|Borikén]] (Puerto Rico), they Taíno tribes on the island, forcing them to work in the gold mines and in the construction of forts. Many Taíno died, particularly due to [[smallpox]], of which they had no [[immunity (medical)|immunity]]. Other Taínos committed suicide or left the island after the failed Taíno revolt of 1511.<ref>{{cite web|author=Yaz|url=http://www.angelfire.com/az2/puertorico/Iagueybana.html|title='Puerto Rico' Grilla's Homepage|publisher=Angelfire.com|date=June 29, 2001|accessdate=July 23, 2015}}</ref>  The Spanish colonists, fearing the loss of their labor force, complained  the courts that they needed manpower to work in the mines, build forts, and work sugar cane plantations. As an alternative, Las Casas suggested the importation and use of African slaves. In 1517, the Spanish Crown permitted its subjects to import twelve slaves each, thereby beginning the [[slave trade]] on the colonies.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://oregonstate.edu/instruct/phl302/philosophers/las_casas.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20021226015714/http://oregonstate.edu/instruct/phl302/philosophers/las_casas.html|archivedate=December 26, 2002|title=Bartoleme de las Casas|publisher=Oregonstate.edu|date= |accessdate=July 23, 2015}}</ref>

They were allowed to live with their families in a hut on the master's land, and given a patch of land where they could farm, but otherwise were subjected to harsh treatment; including sexual abuse as the majority of colonists had arrived without women; many of them intermarried with the Africans or Taínos. Their [[mixed-race]] descendants formed the first generations of the early Puerto Rican population.<ref name="Diaz"/>

The slaves faced heavy discrimination, and had no opportunity for advancement, though they were educated by their masters.  The Spaniards considered the Africans superior to the Taíno, since the latter were unwilling to assimilate. The slaves, in contrast, had little choice but to adapt. Many converted to [[Christianity]] and were given their masters' surnames.<ref name="Diaz"/>

By 1570, the colonists found that the gold mines were depleted, relegating the island to a garrison for passing ships. The cultivation of crops such as tobacco, cotton, cocoa, and ginger became the cornerstone of the economy.<ref name="GB">[https://books.google.com/books?id=U3yO7M6gOeUC&pg=PA5 ''Slave Revolts in Puerto Rico: Conspiracies and Uprisings, 1795–1873''; by: [[Guillermo A.

After 1784, Spain provided five ways by which slaves could obtain freedom.<ref name="Graces"/>  Five years later, the Spanish Crown issued the "Royal Decree of Graces of 1789", which set new rules related to the slave trade and added restrictions to the granting of freedman status. The decree granted its subjects the right to purchase slaves and to participate in the flourishing slave trade in the Caribbean. Later that year a new slave code, also known as ''El Código Negro'' (The Black Code), was introduced.<ref name="Code">{{cite web|url=http://www.fortunecity.com/victorian/churchmews/1216/BandoNegro.htm|title=El "Bando Negro" o "Código Negro"|trans-title=The "Black Edict" or "Black Code"|language=es|website=Government Gazette of Puerto Rico|issue=No. 67 – 3 June 1848|publisher=fortunecity.com|date=May 31, 1848|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070606200620/http://www.fortunecity.com/victorian/churchmews/1216/BandoNegro.htm|archivedate=June 6, 2007}}</ref>

Under "El Código Negro", a slave could buy his freedom, in the event that his master was willing to sell, by paying the price sought in installments. Slaves were allowed to earn money during their spare time by working as shoemakers, cleaning clothes, or selling the produce they grew on their own plots of land. For the freedom of their newborn child, not yet baptized, they paid at half the going price for a baptized child.<ref name="Code"/> Many of these freedmen started settlements in the areas which became known as Cangrejos ([[Santurce, San Juan, Puerto Rico|Santurce]]), [[Carolina, Puerto Rico|Carolina]], [[Canóvanas, Puerto Rico|Canóvanas]], [[Loíza, Puerto Rico|Loíza]], and [[Luquillo, Puerto Rico|Luquillo]]. Some became slave owners themselves.<ref name="Diaz"/>

Despite these paths to freedom, from 1790 onwards, the number of slaves more than doubled in Puerto Rico as a result of the dramatic expansion of the sugar industry in the island.<ref name="GB"/>

On March 22, 1873, slavery was legally abolished in Puerto Rico. However, slaves were not emancipated but rather had to ''buy'' their own freedom, at whatever price was set by their last masters. They were also required to work for another three years for their former masters, for other colonists interested in their services, or for the state in order to pay some compensation.<ref name="AE">{{cite web|first=José R. |last=Bas García|url=http://www.independencia.net/historia/jrb_abolicionEsclavitudPR23mar09.html|title=La abolición de la esclavitud de 1873 en Puerto Rico|trans-title=The abolition of slavery in 1873 in Puerto Rico|language=es|website=Center for Advanced Studies of Puerto Rico and the Caribbean|publisher=independencia.net|date=March 23, 2009|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110319000600/http://www.independencia.net/historia/jrb_abolicionEsclavitudPR23mar09.html|archivedate=March 19, 2011}}</ref>

The planters of the Dutch colony relied heavily on [[Slavery in Africa|African slaves]] to cultivate, harvest and process the commodity crops of coffee, cocoa, sugar cane and cotton plantations along the rivers. Planters' treatment of the slaves was notoriously bad.<ref>{{cite book|author=Streissguth, Tom |title=Suriname in Pictures|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hldOMJHlGQwC&pg=PA23|year= 2009|publisher=Twenty-First Century Books|isbn=978-1-57505-964-8|pages=23–}}</ref>  Historian [[C.

Many slaves escaped the plantations.  With the help of the [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|native South Americans]] living in the adjoining rain forests, these runaway slaves established a new and unique culture in the interior that was highly successful in its own right. They were known collectively in English as [[Maroon (people)|Maroons]], in French as ''Nèg'Marrons'' (literally meaning "brown negroes", that is "pale-skinned negroes"), and in Dutch as ''Marrons.''  The Maroons gradually developed several independent tribes through a process of [[ethnogenesis]], as they were made up of slaves from different African ethnicities. These tribes include the [[Saramaka]],  Paramaka, [[Ndyuka people|Ndyuka]] or Aukan, [[Kwinti]], [[Aluku]] or Boni, and Matawai.

The Maroons often raided plantations to recruit new members from the slaves and capture women, as well as to acquire weapons, food and supplies. They sometimes killed planters and their families in the raids.<ref>Mentelle, Simon M., [http://www.wdl.org/en/item/524/ "Extract of the Dutch Map Representing the Colony of Surinam"], c.1777, Digital World Library via Library of Congress. Retrieved May 26, 2013.</ref>  The colonists also mounted armed campaigns against the Maroons, who generally escaped through the rain forest, which they knew much better than did the colonists.

To end hostilities, in the 18th century the European colonial authorities signed several peace treaties with different tribes. They granted the Maroons sovereign status and trade rights in their inland territories, giving them autonomy.

In 1861-63, President [[Abraham Lincoln]] of the United States and his administration looked abroad for places to relocate freed slaves who wanted to leave the United States. It opened negotiations with the Dutch government regarding African-American emigration to and colonization of the Dutch colony of Suriname in South America. Nothing came of the idea and, after 1864, the idea was dropped.<ref>Michael J. Douma, "The Lincoln Administration's Negotiations to Colonize African Americans in Dutch Suriname," ''Civil War History'' 61#2 (2015): 111–37.

The Netherlands abolished slavery in Suriname, in 1863, under a gradual process that required slaves to work on plantations for 10 transition years for minimal pay, which was considered as partial compensation for their masters. After 1873, most [[freedmen]] largely abandoned the plantations where they had worked for several generations in favor of the capital city, [[Paramaribo]].

[[File:Slave Trader, Sold to Tennessee.jpg|thumb|A coffle of slaves being driven on foot from [[Staunton, Virginia|Staunton]], Virginia to Tennessee in 1850.]]
Slavery in the United States was the legal institution of human [[chattel slavery|chattel enslavement]], primarily of Africans and [[African Americans]], that existed in the United States of America in the 18th and 19th centuries after it gained independence and before the end of the [[American Civil War]]. Slavery had been practiced in [[British America]] from early colonial days, and was legal in all [[Thirteen Colonies]] at the time of the Declaration of Independence in 1776.

By the time of the [[American Revolution]] (1775–1783), the status of slave had been institutionalized as a racial caste associated with African ancestry.<ref>{{Cite magazine |last=Wood |first=Peter |date=2003 |title=The Birth of Race-Based Slavery |url=http://www.slate.com/articles/life/the_history_of_american_slavery/2015/05/why_america_adopted_race_based_slavery.html |magazine=Slate}}</ref>  The United States became polarized over the issue of slavery, represented by the [[slave and free states]] divided by the [[Mason–Dixon line]], which separated free Pennsylvania from slave Maryland and Delaware.

Those states attempted to extend slavery into the new Western territories to keep their share of political power in the nation.

The treatment of slaves in the United States varied widely depending on conditions, times and places. The power relationships of slavery corrupted many whites who had authority over slaves, with children showing their own cruelty. Masters and overseers resorted to physical punishments to impose their wills. Slaves were punished by whipping, shackling, hanging, beating, burning, mutilation, branding and imprisonment. Punishment was most often meted out in response to disobedience or perceived infractions, but sometimes abuse was carried out to re-assert the dominance of the master or overseer of the slave.<ref name=Wilbert>{{cite book|last=Moore|first=Wilbert Ellis|title=American Negro Slavery and Abolition: A Sociological Study|year=1980|publisher=Ayer Publishing}}</ref> Treatment was usually harsher on large plantations, which were often managed by overseers and owned by absentee slaveholders, conditions permitting abuses.

[[William Wells Brown]], who escaped to freedom, reported that on one plantation, slave men were required to pick 80 pounds per day of cotton, while women were required to pick 70 pounds; if any slave failed in his or her quota, they were subject to whip lashes for each pound they were short. The whipping post stood next to the cotton scales.<ref>Clinton, Catherine, ''Scholastic Encyclopedia of the Civil War'', New York: Scholastic Inc., 1999, p. 8.</ref> A New York man who attended a slave auction in the mid-19th century reported that at least three-quarters of the male slaves he saw at sale had scars on their backs from whipping.<ref name="McInnis2011">{{cite book|first=Maurie D. |last=McInnis|title=Slaves Waiting for Sale: Abolitionist Art and the American Slave Trade|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=R3W4M4UojrEC&pg=PA129|year=2011|publisher=University of Chicago Press|isbn=978-0-226-55933-9|pages=129–}}</ref> By contrast, small slave-owning families had closer relationships between the owners and slaves; this sometimes resulted in a more humane environment but was not a given.<ref name=Wilbert/>

More than one million slaves were sold from the [[Upper South]], which had a surplus of labor, and taken to the Deep South in a forced migration, splitting up many families.  New communities of African-American culture were developed in the Deep South, and the total slave population in the South eventually reached 4 million before liberation.<ref name="Stephen1999">Stephen D.

In the 19th century, proponents of slavery often defended the institution as a "necessary evil". White people of that time feared that emancipation of black slaves would have more harmful social and economic consequences than the continuation of slavery.  The French writer and traveler [[Alexis de Tocqueville]], in ''[[Democracy in America]]'' (1835), expressed opposition to slavery while observing its effects on American society. He felt that a multiracial society without slavery was untenable, as he believed that prejudice against blacks increased as they were granted more rights.  Others, like [[James Henry Hammond]] argued that slavery was a "positive good" stating: "Such a class you must have, or you would not have that other class which leads progress, civilization, and refinement."

The Southern state governments wanted to keep a balance between the number of slave and free states to maintain a political balance of power in [[United States Congress|Congress]]. The new [[Territories of the United States|territories]] acquired from [[British Empire|Britain]], [[French colonial empire|France]], and Mexico were the subject of major political compromises. By 1850, the newly rich cotton-growing South was threatening to secede from the [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]], and tensions continued to rise.  Many white Southern Christians, including church ministers, attempted to justify their support for slavery as modified by Christian paternalism.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.christianitytoday.com/history/issues/issue-33/why-christians-supported-slavery.html#storystream|title=Why Did So Many Christians Support Slavery?|website=christianitytoday.com|accessdate=August 28, 2017}}</ref>  The largest denominations, the Baptist, Methodist, and Presbyterian churches, split over the slavery issue into regional organizations of the North and South.

When [[Abraham Lincoln]] won the [[United States presidential election, 1860|1860 election]] on a platform of halting the expansion of slavery, according to the [[1860 United States Census|1860 U.S. census]], roughly 400,000 individuals, representing 8 percent of all US families, owned nearly 4,000,000 slaves.<ref>[http://www.civil-war.net/pages/1860_census.html 1860 Census Results] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040604075834/http://www.civil-war.net/pages/1860_census.html |date=June 4, 2004 }}, The Civil War Home Page.</ref> One-third of Southern families owned slaves.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/national/archive/2010/08/small-truth-papering-over-a-big-lie/61136/|title=Small Truth Papering Over a Big Lie |publisher=The Atlantic |date=August 9, 2010 |accessdate=September 29, 2015}}</ref>  The south was heavily invested in slavery.  As such, upon Lincoln's election, seven states broke away to form the [[Confederate States of America|Confederacy]]. The first six states to secede held the greatest number of slaves in the South. Shortly after, over the issue of slavery, the United States erupted into an all out [[American Civil War|Civil War]], with slavery not legally ceasing as an institution, until December 1865.

In 2018, the ''Orlando Sentinel'' reported some private Christian schools in Florida as teaching students a [[Creationism|Creationist]] curriculum which includes assertions such as, “most black and white southerners had long lived together in harmony” and that “power-hungry individuals stirred up the people” leading to the [[Civil rights movement (1865–1896)|Civil Rights]] Movement.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.orlandosentinel.com/features/education/school-zone/os-voucher-school-curriculum-20180503-story.html |title=Schools Without Rules: Private schools' curriculum downplays slavery, says humans and dinosaurs lived together |author-last=Postal, et al |author-first=Leslie |publisher=Orlando Sentinel |date=June 1, 2018 |accessdate=June 5, 2018}}</ref>

In the 17th century [[Qing Dynasty]], there was a hereditarily servile people called ''Booi Aha'' (Manchu:booi niyalma; Chinese transliteration: 包衣阿哈), which is a Manchu word literally translated as "household person" and sometimes rendered as "[[nucai]]." The Manchu was establishing close personal and paternalist relationship between masters and their slaves, as Nurhachi said, "The Master should love the slaves and eat the same food as him".<ref>A History of Chinese Civilization</ref>  However,  booi aha "did not correspond exactly to the Chinese category of "bond-servant slave" (Chinese:奴僕); instead, it was a relationship of personal dependency on a master which in theory guaranteed close personal relationships and equal treatment, even though many western scholars would directly translate "booi" as "bond-servant" (some of the "booi" even had their own servant).<ref name="China Marches West">{{Cite book|last= Perdue|first= Peter |title=China Marches West |publisher= Triliteral |year= 2005 |page=118|isbn= 978-0-674-01684-2|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Yd-2tiB6k-YC&pg=PA118&lpg=PA118&dq=bondservant+in+Manchu+time}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last1=Rodriguez |first1=Junius P. |year=1997 |title=The Historical Encyclopedia of World Slavery |publisher=ABC-CLIO |isbn=978-0-87436-885-7 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ATq5_6h2AT0C&lpg=PA146&dq=chinese%20slaves%20mongols%20manchu&pg=PA146#v=onepage&q=chinese%20slaves%20mongols%20manchu&f=false|language=en}}</ref>

Arakan/Bengal, Malabar, and [[Coromandel Coast|Coromandel]] remained the most important source of forced labour until the 1660s. Between 1626 and 1662, the Dutch exported on an average 150–400 slaves annually from the Arakan-Bengal coast. During the first thirty years of Batavia's existence, Indian and Arakanese slaves provided the main labour force of the Dutch East India Company, Asian headquarters.

An increase in Coromandel slaves occurred during a famine following the revolt of the Nayaka Indian rulers of South India (Tanjavur, Senji, and Madurai) against Bijapur overlordship (1645) and the subsequent devastation of the Tanjavur countryside by the Bijapur army. Reportedly, more than 150,000 people were taken by the invading Deccani Muslim armies to Bijapur and Golconda. In 1646, 2,118 slaves were exported to Batavia, the overwhelming majority from southern Coromandel. Some slaves were also acquired further south at Tondi, Adirampatnam, and Kayalpatnam. Another increase in slaving took place between 1659 and 1661 from Tanjavur as a result of a series of successive Bijapuri raids. At Nagapatnam, Pulicat, and elsewhere, the company purchased 8,000–10,000 slaves, the bulk of whom were sent to Ceylon while a small portion were exported to Batavia and Malacca. Finally, following a long drought in Madurai and southern Coromandel, in 1673, which intensified the prolonged Madurai-Maratha struggle over Tanjavur and punitive fiscal practices, thousands of people from Tanjavur, mostly girls and little boys, were sold into slavery and exported by Asian traders from Nagapattinam to Aceh, Johor, and other slave markets.

In September 1687, 665 slaves were exported by the English from Fort St. George, Madras.  And, in 1694–96, when warfare once more ravaged South India, a total of 3,859 slaves were imported from Coromandel by private individuals into Ceylon.<ref>S.

The volume of the total Dutch Indian Ocean slave trade has been estimated to be about 15–30 percent of the Atlantic slave trade, slightly smaller than the trans-Saharan slave trade, and one-and-a-half to three times the size of the Swahili and Red Sea coast and the Dutch West India Company slave trades.<ref>Of 2,467 slaves traded on 12 slave voyages from Batavia, India, and Madagascar between 1677 and 1701 to the Cape, 1,617 were landed with a loss of 850 slaves, or 34.45%. On 19 voyages between 1677 and 1732, the mortality rate was somewhat lower (22.7%). See Shell, "Slavery at the Cape of Good Hope, 1680–1731," p. 332. Filliot estimated the average mortality rate among slaves shipped from India and West Africa to the Mascarene Islands at 20–25% and 25–30%, respectively. Average mortality rates among slaves arriving from closer catchment areas were lower: 12% from Madagascar and 21% from Southeast Africa. See Filliot, La Traite des Esclaves, p. 228; A. Toussaint, La Route des Îles: Contribution Ã  l'Histoire Maritime des Mascareignes (Paris, 1967),; Allen, "The Madagascar Slave Trade and Labor Migration."</ref>

The [[Spanish colonization of the Americas]] sparked a discussion about the right to enslave Native Americans. A prominent critic of [[slavery in the Spanish New World colonies]] was [[Bartolomé de las Casas]], who opposed the enslavement of Native Americans, and later also of Africans in America.

One of the first protests against slavery came from German and Dutch [[Religious Society of Friends|Quakers]] in Pennsylvania in 1688.<ref name="jrank" /> One of the most significant milestones in the campaign to abolish slavery throughout the world occurred in England in 1772, with British judge [[William Murray, 1st Earl of Mansfield|Lord Mansfield]], whose opinion in [[Somersett's Case]] was widely taken to have held that slavery was illegal in England. This judgement also laid down the principle that slavery contracted in other jurisdictions could not be enforced in England.<ref>S.M.

[[Sons of Africa]] was a late 18th-century British group that campaigned to end slavery. Its members were Africans in London, freed slaves who included [[Ottobah Cugoano]], [[Olaudah Equiano]] and other leading members of London's black community. It was closely connected to the Society for the Abolition of the Slave Trade, a non-denominational group founded in 1787, whose members included Thomas Clarkson.

British Member of Parliament [[William Wilberforce]] led the anti-slavery movement in the United Kingdom, although the groundwork was an anti-slavery essay by [[Thomas Clarkson]]. Wilberforce was also urged by his close friend, Prime Minister [[William Pitt the Younger]], to make the issue his own, and was also given support by reformed Evangelical [[John Newton]]. The [[Slave Trade Act 1807|Slave Trade Act]] was passed by the British Parliament on March 25, 1807, making the slave trade illegal throughout the [[British Empire]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://royalnavy.mod.uk/history/battles/royal-navy-and-the-slave-trade/ |archive-url=http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20090128205546/royalnavy.mod.uk/history/battles/royal-navy-and-the-slave-trade/ |dead-url=yes |archive-date=January 28, 2009 |title=Royal Navy and the Slave Trade : Battles : History : Royal Navy |date= |accessdate=September 29, 2015}}</ref> Wilberforce also campaigned for abolition of slavery in the British Empire, which he lived to see in the [[Slavery Abolition Act 1833]]. After the 1807 act abolishing the slave trade was passed, these campaigners switched to [[Blockade of Africa|encouraging other countries]] to follow suit, notably France and the British colonies. Between 1808 and 1860, the British [[West Africa Squadron]] seized approximately 1,600 slave ships and freed 150,000 Africans who were aboard.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/devon/content/articles/2007/03/20/abolition_navy_feature.shtml |title=Devon – Abolition – Sailing against slavery |publisher=BBC |date=February 28, 2007 |accessdate=September 29, 2015}}</ref> Action was also taken against African leaders who refused to agree to British treaties to outlaw the trade, for example against "the usurping King of Lagos", deposed in 1851.

In 1839, the world's oldest international human rights organization, [[Anti-Slavery International]], was formed in Britain by [[Joseph Sturge]], which campaigned to outlaw slavery in other countries.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://portal.unesco.org/education/en/ev.php-URL_ID=9462&URL_DO=DO_PRINTPAGE&URL_SECTION=201.html |title=Anti-Slavery International: UNESCO Education |publisher=Portal.unesco.org |date=November 13, 2002 |accessdate=September 29, 2015}}</ref> There were celebrations in 2007 to commemorate the 200th anniversary of the abolition of the slave trade in the United Kingdom through the work of the British [[Anti-Slavery Society]].

In the [[United States]], abolitionist pressure produced a series of small steps towards emancipation. After the [[Act Prohibiting Importation of Slaves]] went into effect on January 1, 1808, the importation of slaves into the United States was prohibited,<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/2007/12/30/opinion/30foner.html Foner, Eric. "Forgotten step towards freedom"], ''The New York Times'', December 30, 2007.</ref> but not the [[Slavery in the United States#Internal slave trade|internal slave trade]], nor involvement in the international slave trade externally. Legal slavery persisted; most of those slaves already in the U.S. were [[Emancipation Proclamation|legally emancipated]] only in 1863. Many American abolitionists took an active role in opposing slavery by supporting the [[Underground Railroad]]. Violent clashes between anti-slavery and pro-slavery Americans included [[Bleeding Kansas]], a series of political and armed disputes in 1854–1861 as to whether Kansas would join the United States as a [[Slave and free states|slave or free state]]. By 1860, the total number of slaves reached almost four million, and the [[American Civil War]], beginning in 1861, led to the end of slavery in the United States.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.itd.nps.gov/cwss/manassas/social/introsoc.htm|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070714073725/http://www.itd.nps.gov/cwss/manassas/social/introsoc.htm|archivedate=July 14, 2007 |title=Soldiers and Sailors Database – The Civil War (U.S. National Park Service) |publisher=Itd.nps.gov |date=September 19, 2015 |accessdate=September 29, 2015}}</ref> In 1863, Lincoln issued the [[Emancipation Proclamation]], which freed slaves held in the Confederate States; the [[Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|13th Amendment to the U.&nbsp;S. Constitution]] prohibited most forms of slavery throughout the country.

In the case of freed slaves of the United States, many became sharecroppers and indentured servants. In this manner, some became tied to the very parcel of land into which they had been born a slave having little freedom or economic opportunity due to [[Jim Crow laws]] which perpetuated discrimination, limited education, promoted persecution without due process and resulted in continued poverty. Fear of reprisals such as unjust incarcerations and lynchings deterred upward mobility further.

In the 1860s, [[David Livingstone]]'s reports of atrocities within the [[Arab slave trade]] in Africa stirred up the interest of the British public, reviving the flagging abolitionist movement. The Royal Navy throughout the 1870s attempted to suppress "this abominable Eastern trade", at [[Zanzibar]] in particular. In 1905, the French abolished indigenous slavery in most of [[French West Africa]].<ref>{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.yale.edu/agrarianstudies/colloqpapers/16peterson.pdf |title=Home Page &#124; Agrarian Studies |publisher=Yale.edu |date= |accessdate=September 30, 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130502161407/http://www.yale.edu/agrarianstudies/colloqpapers/16peterson.pdf |archivedate=May 2, 2013 }}</ref>

On December 10, 1948, the [[United Nations General Assembly]] adopted the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]], which declared freedom from slavery is an internationally recognized [[human rights|human right]]. Article 4 of the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] states:

On May 21, 2001, the [[National Assembly of France]] passed the [[Christiane Taubira|Taubira]] law, recognizing slavery as a [[crime against humanity]]. Apologies on behalf of African nations, for their role in trading their countrymen into slavery, remain an open issue since slavery was practiced in Africa even before the first Europeans arrived and the [[Atlantic slave trade]] was performed with a high degree of involvement of several African societies. The black slave market was supplied by well-established slave trade networks controlled by local African societies and individuals.<ref>Adu Boahen, Topics In West African History p. 110</ref> Indeed, as already mentioned in this article, slavery persists in several areas of West Africa until the present day.

<blockquote>There is adequate evidence citing case after case of African control of segments of the trade. Several African nations such as the Calabar and other southern parts of Nigeria had economies depended solely on the trade. African peoples such as the Imbangala of Angola and the Nyamwezi of Tanzania would serve as middlemen or roving bands warring with other African nations to capture Africans for Europeans.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.africawithin.com/kwaku/afrikan_involvement.htm |title=Afrikan Involvement In Atlantic Slave Trade, By Kwaku Person-Lynn, Ph.

Several historians have made important contributions to the global understanding of the African side of the [[Atlantic slave trade]]. By arguing that African merchants determined the assemblage of trade goods accepted in exchange for slaves, many historians argue for African agency and ultimately a shared responsibility for the slave trade.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20050122054905/http://www.h-net.org/reviews/showrev.cgi?path=13661080113274 João C.

In 1999, President [[Mathieu Kerekou]] of [[Benin]] (formerly the Kingdom of [[Dahomey]]) issued a national apology for the central role Africans played in the Atlantic slave trade.<ref name="apology">"[https://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/23/opinion/23gates.html?pagewanted=all&_r=0 Ending the Slavery Blame-Game]", ''The New York Times''.

The issue of an apology is linked to [[reparations for slavery]] and is still being pursued by a number of entities across the world. For example, the Jamaican Reparations Movement approved its declaration and action Plan.

In September 2006, it was reported that the UK government might issue a "statement of regret" over slavery.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/northern_ireland/5369858.stm What the papers say], BBC News, September 22, 2006</ref> This was followed by a "public statement of sorrow" from [[Tony Blair]] on November 27, 2006,<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/politics/6185176.stm Blair 'sorrow' over slave trade], BBC News, November 27, 2006.</ref> and a formal apology on March 14, 2007.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/politics/6451793.stm Blair 'sorry' for UK slavery role] BBC.

On February 25, 2007, the [[Virginia|Commonwealth of Virginia]] resolved to 'profoundly regret' and apologize for its role in the institution of slavery. Unique and the first of its kind in the U.S., the apology was unanimously passed in both Houses as Virginia approached the 400th anniversary of the founding of [[Jamestown, Virginia|Jamestown]], where the first slaves were imported into North America in 1619.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/6394981.stm |title=Virginia 'sorry' for slavery role |publisher=BBC News |date=February 25, 2007 |accessdate=August 29, 2010}}</ref>

On August 24, 2007, Mayor [[Ken Livingstone]] of London, apologized publicly for Britain's role in colonial [[History of slavery|slave trade]]. "You can look across there to see the institutions that still have the benefit of the wealth they created from slavery," he said, pointing towards the financial district. He claimed that London was still tainted by the horrors of slavery. Specifically, London outfitted, financed, and insured many of the ships, which helped fund the building of London's docks. [[Jesse Jackson]] praised Livingstone, and added that reparations should be made, one of his common arguments.<ref name="jump">{{Cite news|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/pages/live/articles/news/news.html?in_article_id=477337&in_page_id=1770|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929105013/http://www.dailymail.co.uk/pages/live/articles/news/news.html?in_article_id=477337&in_page_id=1770|archivedate=September 29, 2007 |title=Livingstone breaks down in tears at slave trade memorial |work=Daily Mail|date=August 23, 2007 |accessdate=August 29, 2010 |location=London |first=Beth |last=Hale}}</ref> The City of Liverpool, which was a large slave trading port, apologized in 1999.

===Reparations===
{{Main|Reparations for slavery}}
There have been movements to achieve reparations for those formerly held as slaves, or sometimes their descendants. Claims for reparations for being held in slavery are handled as a [[Private law|civil law]] matter in almost every country. This is often decried as a serious problem, since former slaves' relative lack of money means they often have limited access to a potentially expensive and futile [[Service of process|legal process]]. Mandatory systems of fines and reparations paid to an as yet undetermined group of claimants from fines, paid by unspecified parties, and collected by authorities have been proposed by advocates to alleviate this "civil court problem.."Since in almost all cases there are no living ex-slaves or living ex-slave owners these movements have gained little traction. In nearly all cases the [[judiciary|judicial system]] has ruled that the [[statute of limitations]] on these possible claims has long since expired.

==Other uses of the term==
The word ''slavery'' is often used as a pejorative to describe any activity in which one is coerced into performing.

===Examples===
Some argue that [[Conscription|military drafts]], and other forms of coerced government labour. constitute "state-operated slavery."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.capmag.com/article.asp?ID=2346 |title=An Idea Not Worth Drafting: Conscription is Slavery |first=Peter |last=Krembs |publisher=Capmag.com |accessdate=September 29, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.davidkopel.com/NRO/2001/Nationalized-Slavery.htm |title=Nationalized Slavery; A policy Italy should dump |website=davidkopel.com |authorlink=Dave Kopel |first=Dave|last=Kopel|date= |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071012125652/http://www.davidkopel.com/NRO/2001/Nationalized-Slavery.htm |archivedate=October 12, 2007 |deadurl=yes}}.

"Slavery" has been used by some [[Antipsychiatry|anti-psychiatry]] proponents to define involuntary psychiatric patients due to there are no unbiased physical tests for mental illness, yet the psychiatric patient must follow the orders of his/her psychiatrist. [[Drapetomania]] was a psychiatric diagnosis for a slave who did not want to be a slave. Thomas Szasz wrote a book titled "Psychiatric Slavery",<ref>{{cite web|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=3OeefBqX7ggC}} |title=Psychiatric Slavery – Thomas Stephen Szasz – Google Books |date= |accessdate=September 29, 2015}}</ref> published in 1998 and a book titled "Liberation by Oppression: A Comparative Study of Slavery and Psychiatry",<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Schaler |first1=J.A. |year=2003 |title=Slavery and psychiatry |url=http://bjp.rcpsych.org/content/183/1/77.2.full |journal=British Journal of Psychiatry |volume=183 |pages=77–78 |doi=10.1192/bjp.183.1.77-a}}</ref> published in 2003.

Proponents of [[animal rights]] apply the term ''slavery'' to the condition of some or all human-owned animals, arguing that their status is comparable to that of human slaves.<ref name="MSpiegel">Spiegel, Marjorie. ''The Dreaded Comparison: Human and Animal Slavery'', New York: Mirror Books, 1996.</ref>

====Wage slavery====
{{Main|Labour economics#Wage slavery|Wage labour}}

The labor market, as institutionalized under today's market economic systems, has been criticized by mainstream [[Socialism|socialists]] and by [[anarcho-syndicalism|anarcho-syndicalists]], who utilise the term [[Labour economics#Wage slavery|wage slavery]] as a [[pejorative]] or [[dysphemism]] for [[wage labour]].{{sfn||Ellerman|1992}}{{sfn|Thompson|1966|pp=599, 912}}{{sfn|Ostergaard|1997|p=133}}{{sfn|Lazonick|1990|p=37}}<ref name="merriam-webster.com">{{cite web |title= wage slave |url= http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/wage%20slave |publisher= merriam-webster.com |accessdate= 4 March 2013 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title= wage slave |url= http://www.dictionary.com/browse/wage-slave |publisher= dictionary.com |accessdate= 4 March 2013 }}</ref> Socialists draw parallels between the trade of labour as a commodity and slavery. [[Cicero]] is also known to have suggested such parallels.<ref>"...vulgar are the means of livelihood of all hired workmen whom we pay for mere manual labour, not for artistic skill; for in their case the very wage they receive is a pledge of their slavery.''" – [[De Officiis]] [http://www.constitution.org/rom/de_officiis.htm]</ref>

==In films==
{{Main|List of films featuring slavery}}
Film has been the most influential medium in the presentation of the history of slavery to the general public around the world.<ref>Michael T. Martin and David C. Wall, "The Politics of Cine-Memory: Signifying Slavery in the History Film," in Robert A. Rosenstone and Constantin Parvulesu, eds. ''A Companion to the Historical Film'' (Wiley-Blackwell, 2013), pp. 445–67.</ref> The American film industry has had a complex relationship with slavery and until recent decades often avoided the topic. Films such as ''[[Birth of a Nation]]'' (1915)<ref>Melvyn Stokes, ''D.W. Griffith's the Birth of a Nation: A History of the Most Controversial Motion Picture of All Time'' (2008)</ref> and ''[[Gone with the Wind (film)|Gone with the Wind]]'' (1939) became controversial because they gave a favourable depiction. The last favourable treatment was ''[[Song of the South]]'' from Disney in 1946. In 1940 ''[[Santa Fe Trail (film)|The Santa Fe Trail]]'' gave a liberal but ambiguous interpretation of [[John Brown (abolitionist)|John Brown]]'s attacks on slavery&nbsp;– the film does not know what to do with slavery.<ref>Morsberger, Robert E., "Slavery and 'The Santa Fe Trail,' or, John Brown on Hollywood's Sour Apple Tree," ''American Studies'' (1977) 18#2, pp. 87–98.

Most Hollywood films used American settings, although [[Spartacus (film)|''Spartacus'' (1960)]], dealt with an actual revolt in the Roman Empire known as the [[Third Servile War]]. It failed and all the rebels were executed, but their spirit lived on according to the film.<ref>Natalie Zemon Davis, ''Slaves on Screen: Film and Historical Vision'' (2002) ch 2</ref>  ''[[The Last Supper (1976 film)|The Last Supper]]'' (''La última cena'' in Spanish) was a 1976 film directed by Cuban [[Tomás Gutiérrez Alea]] about the teaching of Christianity to slaves in Cuba, and emphasizes the role of ritual and revolt. ''[[Burn!]]'' takes place on the imaginary Portuguese island of Queimada (where the locals speak Spanish) and it merges historical events that took place in Brazil, Cuba, Santo Domingo, Jamaica, and elsewhere.  ''Spartacus'' stays surprisingly close to the historical record.<ref>Davis, ''Slaves on Screen: Film and Historical Vision'' (2002) ch 3</ref>

Historians agree that films have largely shaped historical memories, but they debate issues of accuracy, plausibility, moralism, sensationalism, how facts are stretched in search of broader truths, and suitability for the classroom.<ref>{{cite journal|first=Steven |last=Mintz|title=Spielberg's Amistad and the History Classroom|journal=The History Teacher|date=1998|volume=31|issue=3|pages=370–73|jstor=494885}}</ref><ref>Davis, ''Slaves on Screen: Film and Historical Vision'' (2002)</ref> Berlin argues that critics complain if the treatment emphasizes historical brutality, or if it glosses over the harshness to highlight the emotional impact of slavery.<ref>{{cite journal|first=Ira|last= Berlin|title=American Slavery in History and Memory and the Search for Social Justice|journal=Journal of American History|date=2004|volume=90|issue= 4|pages=1251–68|jstor=3660347}}</ref>
