The '''Moravian Sun Inn''' was an  18th-century inn built by the [[Moravian Church|Moravian community]] at [[Bethlehem, Pennsylvania|Bethlehem]], [[Pennsylvania]] to provide accommodations for non-Moravian merchants who had business with the community.  Many people prominent during the [[American Revolution]] stayed there, including [[George Washington]], [[Martha Washington]], [[Alexander Hamilton]], [[Benjamin Franklin]], [[John Adams]], [[Samuel Adams]], [[John Hancock]], and the [[Marquis de Lafayette]]. On September 22, 1777 fourteen members of the [[Continental Congress]] signed the register and stayed overnight.<ref name="arch">{{cite web| url = https://www.dot7.state.pa.us/ce/SelectWelcome.asp| title = National Historic Landmarks & National Register of Historic Places in Pennsylvania| publisher = CRGIS: Cultural Resources Geographic Information System| format = Searchable database}} ''Note:'' This includes {{cite web| url = {{NRHP-PA|H001027_01H.pdf}}| title = National Register of Historic Places Inventory Nomination Form: Moravian Sun Inn | accessdate = 2011-11-07| author = unknown| format = PDF| date= n.d.}}</ref>

The original inn was built in 1758, as a {{Convert|66|by|40|ft|sing=on}}, two-story stone building with a mansard roof. In 1826 a third story was added with 17 new rooms. In 1866 the building was again enlarged, almost completely hiding  the original inn. It was added to the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 1978.<ref name="D and L">{{cite web

After Washington's defeat at the [[Battle of Brandywine]] much of the American army's baggage and stores were kept near the inn and many people fleeing [[Philadelphia]] stayed at the inn.  During [[Fries's Rebellion]] in 1799 seventeen of Fries's followers were held at the inn and then freed by Fries.
