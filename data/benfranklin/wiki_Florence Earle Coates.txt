'''Florence Van Leer Earle Nicholson Coates''' (July 1, 1850 &ndash; April 6, 1927) was an American poet.

==Biography==
She was born in [[Philadelphia]], Pennsylvania.  Granddaughter of noted abolitionist and philanthropist [[Thomas Earle]], and eldest daughter of Philadelphia lawyer [[George Hussey Earle, Sr.|George H. Earle, Sr.]] and Mrs. Frances ("Fanny") Van Leer Earle,  Mrs. Coates gained notoriety both at home and abroad for her works of poetry—nearly three-hundred of which were published in literary magazines such as the ''Atlantic Monthly, Scribner's Magazine, The Literary Digest, Lippincott's, The Century Magazine, and Harper's''.  Many of her poems were [[wikisource:Author:Florence Earle Coates/Music|set to music]] by composers such as Mrs. [[Amy Cheney Beach|H. H. A. Beach]] (Amy Cheney Beach), Clayton Johns, and Charles Gilbert Spross.  She attended school in New England under the instruction of abolitionist and teacher [[Theodore Dwight Weld]], and would further her education abroad at the Convent of the Sacred Heart in Paris (Rue de Varenne),<ref>The Sacré Cœur (Sacred Heart) in Paris, France was a convent school for young girls run by nuns that fell to the French government as a result of the "religious orders" law of 1904, which involved the separation of church and state, and prohibited religious orders from teaching.  The site of the former convent is now the [[Musée Rodin|Rodin Museum]].</ref> and by studying music in Brussels under noted instructors of the day.

Literary and social critic [[Matthew Arnold]] both encouraged and inspired Mrs. Coates' writing of poetry.  He was a guest at the Coates' [[Germantown, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania|Germantown]] home when his lecture tours brought him to Philadelphia.  Coates and Arnold first met in New York—during Arnold's first visit and lecture tour of America—at the home of [[Andrew Carnegie]], "where they formed a lasting friendship."<ref>''Notable Women of Pennsylvania'' (1947), edited by Gertrude B. Biddle and Sarah D. Lowrie.</ref>  The tour (which lasted from October 1883 to March 1884) brought Arnold to Philadelphia in December 1883, where he lectured at Association Hall on the topics of the "Doctrine of the Remnant" and on "Emerson."<ref>"Matthew Arnold on the Doctrine of the Remnant." ''Philadelphia Inquirer'', 28 December 1883.</ref>  His second visit and tour of America took place in 1886, and brought him to Philadelphia in early June where he was again hosted by Mr. and Mrs. Coates and spoke on the topic of "Foreign Education" at the University of Pennsylvania chapel.<ref>"Reception to Matthew Arnold." ''Philadelphia Inquirer'', 11 June 1886.</ref>  Arnold wrote to Mrs. Coates in 1887<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=4yk6AAAAMAAJ&pg=RA1-PA376&dq=coates+%22I+do+not+write+about+the+literary+performances+of+living+contemporaries+or+contemporaries+only+recently+dead%22&as_brr=1#PRA1-PA362,M1 Letter from Matthew Arnold to Florence Earle Coates dated 29 January 1887.]</ref> and 1888<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=4yk6AAAAMAAJ&pg=RA1-PA376&dq=coates+%22I+do+not+write+about+the+literary+performances+of+living+contemporaries+or+contemporaries+only+recently+dead%22&as_brr=1#PRA1-PA376,M1 Letter from Matthew Arnold to Florence Earle Coates dated 24 February 1888.]</ref> from his home at Pains Hill Cottage in Cobham, Surrey, England describing his remembrance of and fondness for her "tulip-trees and maples" at her Germantown home, "Willing Terrace."  Rarely did Mrs. Coates write or publish prose work, but in April 1894 and again in December 1909, she dedicated her pen to remembrances of her mentor in issues of ''The Century'' and ''Lippincott's'' magazines respectively.

Between 1887 and 1912, Mrs. Coates published over two dozen poems within ''The Century Magazine''. Her correspondence between ''Century'' editor [[Richard Watson Gilder]] and others is documented at the New York Public Library Digital Collections website.<ref>Manuscripts and Archives Division, The New York Public Library. "Coates, Florence Earle" ''The New York Public Library Digital Collections''. 1886 - 1914. https://digitalcollections.nypl.org/items/ab8d1c90-6238-0134-2dec-00505686a51c</ref> In one letter dated 12 March 1905, Coates submits to Mr. Gilder a poem she wrote after being inspired by a photograph of [[Helen Keller]] holding a rose which was published in ''The Century'' the previous January. Mrs. Coates requests that, if published, the poem also be accompanied by a copy of the photograph, and shares that Ms. Keller sends word that she "accords [Coates] any permission" to use the photo for that purpose. The poem, "[[s:Helen Keller with a Rose|Helen Keller with a Rose]]", is published in the July 1905 issue—without the accompanying photograph, but with reference to the issue in which it first appeared. 

The Coates' often spent their summer months in the Adirondacks, where they maintained "Camp Elsinore"—their summer camp by the [[Upper St. Regis Lake]].  It was there that they entertained, rested and escaped the humidity of Philadelphia summers, welcoming friends such as [[Otis Skinner]], [[Violet Oakley]], [[Henry Mills Alden]], and [[Agnes Repplier]].<ref>"[[s:Florence Earle Coates (Ring)|Florence Earle Coates: Some Phases of Her Life and Poetry]]" by Elizabeth Clendenning Ring. ''Book News Monthly'' (December 1917) </ref> In the early 1900s (decade), the Coates' seasonally opened their camp to [[Bamie Roosevelt|Anna Roosevelt Cowles]] ("Bamie")—elder sister of [[Theodore Roosevelt]].  Among Mrs. Cowles' visitors during her stays at Elsinore was [[Alice Roosevelt Longworth|Alice Roosevelt]], President Theodore Roosevelt's daughter.<ref>''New York Times'', 28 June, 19 & 26 July, and 30 August 1903.  Mrs. Cowles' stays are also mentioned (along with a photograph) in Lilian Rixey's biographical book, ''Bamie: Theodore Roosevelt's Remarkable Sister.''</ref>   Many of Mrs. Coates' nature poems were inspired by the flora and fauna of the Adirondacks.  Of her "spot in the mountains," Mrs. Coates sings:

[[Image:Coates Camp Elsinore letterhead bookplate.jpg|thumb|200px|left|<center>'''Upper St. Regis Lake'''</center><poem> ''There's a lake upon''
 ''the mountains...''—FEC
</poem>]]
<br><small><poem>There's a cabin in the mountains, where the fare, dear,
      Is frugal as the cheer of Arden blest;
But contentment sweet and fellowship are there, dear,
      And Love, that makes the feast he honors—best!
</poem></small>

In the March 1913 issue of ''Lippincott's Monthly Magazine'', noted anthologist and poet, [[William Stanley Braithwaite]] (1878–1962), gives a detailed 9-page review of Mrs. Coates' poetry, relating how "she draws from the Olympian world figures that typify some motive or desire in human conduct, and in the modern world the praise of men and women, heroic in attainment or sacrifice; or laments events that effect social and ethical progress, showing how beneficently she has brought her art, without modifying in the least its abstract function as a creator of beauty and pleasure, into the service of profound and vital problems."<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=IMrUAAAAMAAJ&pg=RA1-PA296 ''A Foremost American Lyrist: An Appreciation'' by [[William Stanley Braithwaite]]]</ref>  Much of Mrs. Coates' later published work was written during the years spanning World War I and showcased her concern for such "profound and vital problems" as her voice joined the chorus of 'singers' in support of American involvement in the war—evidenced in her privately published pamphlet of war poetry, ''[[Pro Patria (Coates)|Pro Patria]]'' (1917).  Mrs. Coates also penned several other works of [[wikisource:Author:Florence Earle Coates#Fugitive verse|fugitive verse]], much of which is patriotic and war-related, describing the selfless sacrifices made by soldiers and citizens alike for the cause of freedom and liberty.

She married first, William Nicholson (28 September 1872)—who died on 9 September 1877. On 7 January 1879, she married [[Edward Hornor Coates]] at [[Christ Church, Philadelphia|Christ Church]] in Philadelphia.  Mr. Coates would eventually adopt Florence's daughter from her first marriage—Alice Earle Nicholson (born 21 October 1873).  Florence and Edward had one child together in 1881, but the baby—Josephine Wisner Coates<ref>likely named after Josephine Wisner, great-great granddaughter of [[Henry Wisner]]—delegate of the 1st and 2nd Continental Congress and among signers of the original draft of the Declaration of Independence.  Josephine Wisner's mother, Eleanor Bowne Hornor, was Florence Earle Coates' husband's second cousin.</ref>—died in infancy on 5 March 1881.  Mr. Coates was president of the [[Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts]] from 1890 to 1906.  He died on 23 December 1921.  In 1923, Mrs. Coates presented ''The Edward H. Coates Memorial Collection'' to the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts in Philadelphia.  The exhibition, representing French and American schools,<ref>''Philadelphia: A Guide to the Nation's Birthplace''. Pennsylvania Historical Commission, 1937. p. 456.</ref> included 27 paintings and 3 pieces of sculpture, and was displayed from 4 November 1923 to 10 January 1924.  Florence died at Hahnemann Hospital in Philadelphia on 6 April 1927.  She is buried at the Church of the Redeemer churchyard in [[Bryn Mawr, Pennsylvania]] alongside her husband and her brother [[George Howard Earle, Jr.]] and many of his descendants, including his son, former Pennsylvania Governor, [[George Howard Earle III]]—Florence's nephew.<ref>[http://www.lowermerionhistory.org/burial/redeemer/cd.html The Lower Merion Historical Society website (see Coates, Florence Earle).]</ref>
