The '''Detroit Publishing Company''' was an [[United States|American]] [[photography|photographic]] publishing firm best known for its large assortment of [[photochrom]] color postcards.

==History==

The Detroit Publishing Company was started by publisher William A. Livingstone and photographer Edwin H. Husher in the late 19th century. It wasn't until 1905 that the company called itself the Detroit Publishing Company.<ref name=WDL1>{{cite web|title=Margaret's Isle, Budapest, Hungary, Austro-Hungary|url=http://www.wdl.org/en/item/2641/|publisher=World Digital Library|accessdate=19 January 2013}}</ref>

The company acquired [[exclusive rights]] to use a form of photography processing called [[Photochrom]]. Photochrom allowed for the company to [[mass market]] [[postcard]]s and other materials in color. Their products were sold in the [[United States]].<ref name=WDL1/> Around 1899, they published "Views of People and Sites in [[Algeria]]."<ref name=WDL2>{{cite web|title=Great Mosque in the Marine Street, Algiers, Algeria|url=http://www.wdl.org/en/item/2466/|publisher=World Digital Library|accessdate=23 January 2013}}</ref>

By the time of [[World War I]], the company faced declining sales both due to the war economy and the competition from cheaper, more advanced printing methods. The company declared bankruptcy in 1924 and was liquidated in 1932.

===William Henry Jackson===
The best-known photographer for the company was [[William Henry Jackson]], who joined the company in 1897. He became the plant manager in 1903, and in 1905 the company changed its name.
