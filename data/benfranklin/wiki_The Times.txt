'''''The Times''''' is a British [[Newspaper#Daily|daily]] (Monday to Saturday) [[Newspaper#National|national newspaper]] based in London. It began in 1785 under the title '''''The Daily Universal Register''''', adopting its current name on 1 January 1788. ''The Times'' and its [[sister paper]] ''[[The Sunday Times]]'' (founded in 1821) are published by Times Newspapers, since 1981 a subsidiary of [[News UK]], itself wholly owned by [[News Corp]]. ''The Times'' and ''The Sunday Times'' do not share editorial staff, were founded independently, and have only had common ownership since 1967.

In 1959, the historian of journalism [[Allan Nevins]] analysed the importance of ''The Times'' in shaping the views of events of London's elite:

<blockquote>For much more than a century ''The Times'' has been an integral and important part of the political structure of Great Britain.  Its news and its editorial comment have in general been carefully coordinated, and have at most times been handled with an earnest sense of responsibility. While the paper has admitted some trivia to its columns, its whole emphasis has been on important public affairs treated with an eye to the best interests of Britain.  To guide this treatment, the editors have for long periods been in close touch with [[10 Downing Street]].<ref>Allan Nevins, "American Journalism and Its Historical Treatment", ''Journalism Quarterly'' (1959) 36#4 pp 411-22</ref></blockquote>

''The Times'' is the first newspaper to have borne that name, lending it to numerous other papers around the world, such as ''[[The Times of India]]'' and ''[[The New York Times]]''. In countries where these other titles are popular, the newspaper is often referred to as {{nowrap|'''''The London Times'''''}}<ref>{{cite web|url=http://oii.org.au/5070/london-times-semenya-middle-sex/ |title=London Times: "Caster Semenya and the middle sex" &#124; OII Australia – Intersex Australia |publisher=Oii.org.au |date=20 November 2009 |accessdate=8 April 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.adnews.com.au/adnews/london-times-posts-digital-subs-rise |title=London Times posts digital subs rise |publisher=AdNews |date=4 July 2011 |accessdate=8 April 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.seashepherd.org.au/news-and-media/2007/02/09/the-london-times-gets-it-wrong-725 |title=Sea Shepherd Australia :: The London Times Gets It Wrong |publisher=Seashepherd.org.au |date=9 February 2007 |accessdate=8 April 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140409180544/http://seashepherd.org.au/news-and-media/2007/02/09/the-london-times-gets-it-wrong-725 |archivedate=9 April 2014 |df=dmy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite news|author=Amy Hubbard |url=http://articles.latimes.com/2013/jul/19/world/la-fg-wn-kate-william-royal-baby-hospital-20130719 |title=Royal baby watch: Kate, William head to London; media say hallelujah |publisher=Los Angeles Times|date=19 July 2013 |accessdate=8 April 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.timesofmalta.com/articles/view/20100124/local/sea-shepherd-heading-to-the-mediterranean-to-protect-tuna.291079 |title=Sea Shepherd heading to the Mediterranean to protect tuna |publisher=timesofmalta.com |date=24 January 2010 |accessdate=8 April 2014}}</ref> or {{nowrap|'''''The Times'' of London'''}},<ref>{{cite news|author=|url=https://www.thestar.com/news/2008/01/26/times_editorial_page_calls_for_intervention_to_save_winehouse.html |title=Times' editorial page calls for intervention to save Winehouse &#124; Toronto Star |publisher=Thestar.com |date=26 January 2008 |accessdate=8 April 2014}}</ref> although the newspaper is of national scope and distribution.

''The Times'' is the originator of the widely used [[Times New Roman|Times Roman]] typeface, originally developed by [[Stanley Morison]] of ''The Times'' in collaboration with the [[Monotype Corporation]] for its legibility in low-tech printing. In November 2006 ''The Times'' began printing headlines in a new font, [[Times New Roman#Other typefaces used by The Times|Times Modern]]. ''The Times'' was printed in [[broadsheet]] format for 219 years, but switched to [[compact (newspaper)|compact]] size in 2004 in an attempt to appeal more to younger readers and commuters using public transport. ''The Sunday Times'' remains a broadsheet.

''The Times'' was founded by publisher [[John Walter (publisher)|John Walter]] on 1 January 1785 as ''The Daily Universal Register'', with Walter in the role of editor. Walter had lost his job by the end of 1784 after the insurance company where he worked went bankrupt due to losses from a Jamaican hurricane. Unemployed, Walter began a new business venture. Henry Johnson had recently invented the logography, a new typography that was reputedly faster and more precise (although three years later, it was proved less efficient than advertised). Walter bought the logography's patent and with it opened a printing house to produce a daily advertising sheet. The first publication of the newspaper ''The Daily Universal Register in Great Britain'' was 1 January 1785. Unhappy because the word ''Universal'' was frequently omitted from the name, Walter changed the title after 940 editions on 1 January 1788 to ''The Times''.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia |url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/The-Times |encyclopedia=Encyclopædia Britannica Online |accessdate=11 September 2016}}</ref> In 1803, Walter handed ownership and editorship to [[John Walter (second)|his son]] of the same name. In spite of Walter Sr's sixteen-month stay in [[Newgate Prison]] for [[defamation|libel]] printed in ''The Times'', his pioneering efforts to obtain Continental news, especially from France, helped build the paper's reputation among policy makers and financiers.

''The Times'' used contributions from significant figures in the fields of politics, science, literature, and the arts to build its reputation. For much of its early life, the profits of ''The Times'' were very large and the competition minimal, so it could pay far better than its rivals for information or writers. Beginning in 1814, the paper was printed on the new steam-driven cylinder press developed by [[Friedrich Koenig]].<ref>{{cite book

David Sloan, Lisa Mullikin Parcell|isbn=0-7864-1371-9|year=2002|publisher=McFarland & Co.|quote=Koenig had plans to develop a double-feeding printing machine that would increase production, and the publisher of The Times in London ordered two of the double- feeder machines to be built.}}</ref>  In 1815, ''The Times'' had a circulation of 5,000.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1995/11/20/business/earlier-media-achieved-critical-mass-printing-press-yelling-stop-presses-didn-t.html|title=How the Earlier Media Achieved Critical Mass|author=D.

[[Thomas Barnes (journalist)|Thomas Barnes]] was appointed general editor in 1817. In the same year, the paper's printer James Lawson, died and passed the business onto his son John Joseph Lawson (1802–1852). Under the editorship of Barnes and his successor in 1841, [[John Thadeus Delane]], the influence of ''The Times'' rose to great heights, especially in politics and amongst the [[City of London]]. Peter Fraser and Edward Sterling were two noted journalists, and gained for ''The Times'' the pompous/satirical nickname 'The Thunderer' (from "We thundered out the other day an article on social and political reform."). The increased circulation and influence of the paper was based in part to its early adoption of the steam-driven rotary printing press. Distribution via [[Rail transport|steam trains]] to rapidly growing concentrations of urban populations helped ensure the profitability of the paper and its growing influence.<ref>Lomas, Claire. "[http://journalism.winchester.ac.uk/?page=353 The Steam Driven Rotary Press, The Times and the Empire] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110317185723/http://journalism.winchester.ac.uk/?page=353 |date=17 March 2011 }}"</ref>

''The Times'' was the first newspaper to send [[war correspondent]]s to cover particular conflicts. [[William Howard Russell|W. H. Russell]], the paper's correspondent with the army in the [[Crimean War]], was immensely influential<ref>Knightley, Philip. ''The First Casualty: The War Correspondent as Hero, Propagandist, and Myth-maker from the Crimea to the Gulf War II''</ref> with his dispatches back to England.

[[File:Sir John Everett Millais - Peace Concluded - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|A wounded British officer reading ''The Times's'' report of the end of the [[Crimean War]], in [[John Everett Millais]]' painting ''[[Peace Concluded]]''.]]
In other events of the nineteenth century, ''The Times'' opposed the repeal of the [[Corn Laws]] until the number of demonstrations convinced the editorial board otherwise, and only reluctantly supported aid to victims of the [[Irish Potato Famine]]. It enthusiastically supported the [[Reform Act 1832|Great Reform Bill of 1832]], which reduced corruption and increased the electorate from 400,000 people to 800,000 people (still a small minority of the population). During the [[American Civil War]], ''The Times'' represented the view of the wealthy classes, favouring the secessionists, but it was not a supporter of slavery.

The third [[John Walter (third)|John Walter]], the founder's grandson, succeeded his father in 1847. The paper continued as more or less independent, but from the 1850s ''The Times'' was beginning to suffer from the rise in competition from the [[penny press]], notably ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' and ''[[The Morning Post]]''.

During the 19th century, it was not infrequent for the [[Foreign and Commonwealth Office|Foreign Office]] to approach ''The Times'' and ask for continental intelligence, which was often superior to that conveyed by official sources.{{citation needed|date=August 2014}}

===1890 to 1981===
''The Times'' faced financial extinction in 1890 under [[Arthur Fraser Walter]], but it was rescued by an energetic editor, [[Charles Frederic Moberly Bell]]. During his tenure (1890–1911), ''The Times'' became associated with selling the ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]'' using aggressive American marketing methods introduced by [[Horace Everett Hooper]] and his advertising executive, Henry Haxton. Due to legal fights between the ''Britannica's'' two owners, Hooper and [[Walter Montgomery Jackson]], ''The Times'' severed its connection in 1908 and was bought by pioneering newspaper magnate, [[Alfred Harmsworth]], later Lord Northcliffe.

In editorials published on 29 and 31 July 1914, [[Wickham Steed]], the ''Times's'' Chief Editor, argued that the [[British Empire]] should enter [[World War I]].<ref>Ferguson, Niall (1999). ''The Pity of War'' London: Basic Books. p. 217. {{ISBN|978-0-465-05711-5}}</ref> On 8 May 1920, also under the editorship of [[Wickham Steed|Steed]], ''The Times'' in an editorial endorsed the [[anti-Semitic]] fabrication ''[[The Protocols of the Learned Elders of Zion]]'' as a genuine document, and called Jews the world's greatest danger. In the leader entitled "The Jewish Peril, a Disturbing Pamphlet: Call for Inquiry", Steed wrote about ''The Protocols of the Elders of Zion'': <blockquote>What are these 'Protocols'? Are they authentic? If so, what malevolent assembly concocted these plans and gloated over their exposition? Are they forgery? If so, whence comes the uncanny note of prophecy, prophecy in part fulfilled, in part so far gone in the way of fulfillment?".<ref>Friedländer, Saul (1997). ''Nazi Germany and the Jews''. New York: HarperCollins. p. 95. {{ISBN|978-0-06-019042-2}}</ref></blockquote> The following year, when [[Philip Graves]], the [[Constantinople]] (modern [[Istanbul]]) correspondent of ''The Times'', exposed ''The Protocols'' as a forgery, ''The Times'' retracted the editorial of the previous year.

In 1922, [[John Jacob Astor, 1st Baron Astor of Hever|John Jacob Astor]], son of the [[William Waldorf Astor, 1st Viscount Astor|1st Viscount Astor]], bought ''The Times'' from the [[Alfred Harmsworth|Northcliffe estate]]. The paper gained a measure of notoriety in the 1930s with its advocacy of German [[appeasement]]; editor [[Geoffrey Dawson]] was closely allied with those in the government who practised appeasement, most notably [[Neville Chamberlain]]. Candid news reports by  Norman Ebbut from Berlin that warned of warmongering were rewritten in London to support the appeasement policy.<ref>Gordon Martel, ed.

[[Kim Philby]], a double agent with primary allegiance to the [[Soviet Union]], was a correspondent for the newspaper in Spain during the [[Spanish Civil War]] of the late 1930s. Philby was admired for his courage in obtaining high-quality reporting from the front lines of the bloody conflict. He later joined British Military Intelligence ([[MI6]]) during [[World War II]], was promoted into senior positions after the war ended, and defected to the [[Soviet Union]] when discovery was inevitable in 1963.<ref>{{cite book |title= Treason in the blood: H.

[[File:Roy Thomson Cropped.jpg|thumb|left|[[Roy Thomson, 1st Baron Thomson of Fleet|Roy Thomson]]]]
Between 1941 and 1946, the left-wing British historian [[E. H. Carr]] was assistant editor. Carr was well known for the strongly pro-Soviet tone of his editorials.<ref>Beloff, Max. "The Dangers of Prophecy" pages 8–10 from ''History Today'', Volume 42, Issue # 9, September 1992 page 9</ref> In December 1944, when fighting broke out in [[Athens]] between the Greek Communist [[Greek People's Liberation Army|ELAS]] and the British Army, Carr in a ''Times'' [[Leading article|leader]] sided with the Communists, leading [[Winston Churchill]] to condemn him and the article in a speech to the House of Commons.<ref>Davies, Robert William. "Edward Hallett Carr, 1892–1982" pages 473–511 from ''Proceedings of the British Academy'', Volume 69, 1983 page 489</ref> As a result of Carr's editorial, ''The Times'' became popularly known during that stage of World War II as "the threepenny ''[[Morning Star (British newspaper)|Daily Worker]]''" (the price of the Communist Party's ''Daily Worker'' being one penny).<ref>Haslam, Jonathan. "We Need a Faith: E.H. Carr, 1892–1982" pages 36–39 from ''History Today'', Volume 33, August 1983 page 37</ref>

On 3 May 1966 it resumed printing news on the front page – previously the front page had been given over to small advertisements, usually of interest to the moneyed classes in British society. Also in 1966, the [[Royal coat of arms of the United Kingdom|Royal Arms]], which had been a feature of the newspaper's masthead since its inception, was abandoned.<ref>{{cite book|last=Hasler|first=Charles|title=The Royal Arms&nbsp;— Its Graphic And Decorative Development| publisher=Jupiter Books|date=1980|page=302|ISBN=978-0904041200}}</ref>  In 1967 members of the [[Astor family]] sold the paper to Canadian publishing magnate [[Roy Thomson, 1st Baron Thomson of Fleet|Roy Thomson]]. His [[Thomson Corporation]] brought it under the same ownership as ''[[The Sunday Times]]'' to form [[News UK#Times Newspapers Ltd|Times Newspapers Limited]].

An industrial dispute prompted the management to shut the paper for nearly a year from 1 December 1978 to 12 November 1979.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/november/13/newsid_2539000/2539795.stm|title=BBC ON THIS DAY - 13 - 1979: Times returns after year-long dispute|publisher=}}</ref>

The Thomson Corporation management were struggling to run the business due to the [[1979 energy crisis]] and union demands. Management sought a buyer who was in a position to guarantee the survival of both titles, and had the resources and was committed to funding the introduction of modern printing methods.

Several suitors appeared, including [[Robert Maxwell]], [[Tiny Rowland]] and [[Lord Rothermere]]; however, only one buyer was in a position to meet the full Thomson remit, Australian media magnate Rupert Murdoch. [[Robert Holmes à Court]], another Australian magnate had previously tried to buy ''The Times'' in 1980.

===From 1981===
[[File:The-Times-5-June-2013.jpg|thumb|right|''The Times'' cover (5 June 2013)]]
In 1981, ''The Times'' and ''The Sunday Times'' were bought from Thomson by Rupert Murdoch's [[News UK|News International]].<ref>{{cite book |title=The History of the Times: The Murdoch years, 1981–2002|first1=Graham|last1=Stewart|publisher=HarperCollins|year=2005|isbn=0-00-718438-7| page=45|url=https://books.google.com/?id=eZZZAAAAMAAJ&q=The+History+of+the+Times:+The+Murdoch+years,+1981-2002&dq=The+History+of+the+Times:+The+Murdoch+years,+1981-2002}}</ref> The acquisition followed three weeks of intensive bargaining with the unions by company negotiators John Collier and [[Bill O'Neill (media)|Bill O'Neill]]. The [[Royal coat of arms of the United Kingdom|Royal Arms]] was reintroduced to the masthead at about this time, but whereas previously it had been that of the reigning monarch, it would now be that of the [[House of Hanover]], who were on the throne when the newspaper was founded.

After 14 years as editor, [[William Rees-Mogg]] resigned upon completion of the change of ownership.<ref>Stewart, p. 45</ref> Murdoch began to make his mark on the paper by appointing [[Harold Evans]] as his replacement.<ref name="Stewart, p 51">Stewart, p. 51</ref> One of his most important changes was the introduction of new technology and efficiency measures. Between March 1981 and May 1982, following agreement with print unions, the hot-metal [[Linotype machine|Linotype]] printing process used to print ''The Times'' since the 19th century was phased out and replaced by computer input and photo-composition. This allowed print room staff at ''The Times'' and ''The Sunday Times'' to be reduced by half.<!--from 375 to 186--> However, direct input of text by journalists ("single-stroke" input) was still not achieved, and this was to remain an interim measure until the [[Wapping dispute]] of 1986, when ''The Times'' moved from New [[Printing House Square]] in Gray's Inn Road (near [[Fleet Street]]) to new offices in [[Wapping]].<ref>Hamilton, Alan.

In June 1990 ''The Times'' ceased its policy of using courtesy titles ("Mr", "Mrs", or "Miss" prefixes) for living persons before full names on first reference, but it continues to use them before surnames on subsequent references. The more formal style is now confined to the "Court and Social" page, though "Ms" is now acceptable in that section, as well as before surnames in news sections.

In November 2003, News International began producing the newspaper in both broadsheet and tabloid sizes. On 13 September 2004, the weekday broadsheet was withdrawn from sale in [[Northern Ireland]]. Since 1 November 2004, the paper has been printed solely in tabloid format.

On 6 June 2005, ''The Times'' redesigned its Letters page, dropping the practice of printing correspondents' full postal addresses. Published letters were long regarded as one of the paper's key constituents. Author/solicitor David Green of Castle Morris Pembrokeshire has had more letters published on the main letters page than any other known contributor – 158 by 31 January 2008. According to its [[leading article]] "From Our Own Correspondents", the reason for removal of full postal addresses was to fit more letters onto the page.

In a 2007 meeting with the [[House of Lords]] Select Committee on Communications, which was investigating media ownership and the news, Murdoch stated that the law and the independent board prevented him from exercising editorial control.<ref name=Parliament070917>{{cite conference|title=Minute of the meeting with Mr Rupert Murdoch, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, News Corporation |booktitle=Inquiry into Media Ownership and the News |page=10 |publisher=House of Commons Select Committee on Communications |date=17 September 2007 |url=http://www.parliament.uk/documents/upload/us.doc |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071201082014/http://www.parliament.uk/documents/upload/us.doc |archivedate=1 December 2007 }}

In May 2008 printing of ''The Times'' switched from Wapping to new plants at [[Waltham Cross]] in [[Hertfordshire]], and Merseyside and Glasgow, enabling the paper to be produced with full colour on every page for the first time.

On 26 July 2012, to coincide with the official start of the [[London 2012 Olympics]] and the issuing of a series of souvenir front covers, ''The Times'' added the suffix "of London" to its masthead.<ref name="oflondon">{{cite news|url=https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=484507698245184&set=a.212406988788591.78923.147384458624178| title=Every day during London 2012, The Times will be wrapped in a special panoramic cover.

''The Times'' features news for the first half of the paper; the Opinion/Comment section begins after the first news section with world news normally following this. The business pages begin on the centre spread, and are followed by The Register, containing obituaries, a Court & Social section, and related material. The sport section is at the end of the main paper. In April 2016, the cover price of ''The Times'' became £1.40 on weekdays and £1.50 on  Saturdays.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/apr/14/the-times-increases-cover-price-by-20p-the-first-rise-in-two-years |title=The Times increases cover price by 20p, the first rise in two years |newspaper=The Guardian |date=14 April 2016|author=Mark Sweney|accessdate= 9 September 2016}}</ref>

===''Times2''===
''The Times''<nowiki />'s main supplement, every day, is the ''times2'', featuring various lifestyle columns. It was discontinued on 1 March 2010 but reintroduced on 11 October 2010 after discontinuation was criticised. Its regular features include a puzzles section called ''Mind Games''. Its previous incarnation began on 5 September 2005, before which it was called ''T2'' and previously ''Times 2''. Regular features include columns by a different columnist each weekday. There was a column by [[Marcus du Sautoy]] each Wednesday, for example. The back pages are devoted to puzzles and contain [[sudoku]], "[[Killer Sudoku]]", "[[KenKen]]", [[word polygon]] puzzles, and a [[crossword]] simpler and more concise than the main "Times Crossword".

The supplement contains arts and lifestyle features, TV and radio listings and reviews.

===''The Game''===
''The Game'' is included in the newspaper on Mondays, and details all the weekend's football activity ([[Premier League]] and [[Football League]] [[Football League Championship|Championship]], [[Football League One|League One]] and [[Football League Two|League Two.]]) The Scottish edition of ''The Game'' also includes results and analysis from [[Scottish Premier League]] games. During the [[FIFA World Cup]] and [[UEFA]] Euros there is a daily supplement of The Game. During the summer where there is no international tournament there are no editions of this feature and the transfer window highlights are in the daily Sports section.

===Saturday supplements===
The Saturday edition of ''The Times'' contains a variety of supplements. These supplements were relaunched in January 2009 as: ''Sport'', ''Weekend'' (including travel and lifestyle features), ''Saturday Review'' (arts, books, TV listings and ideas), ''The Times Magazine'' (columns on various topics), and ''Playlist'' (an entertainment listings guide).

''The Times Magazine'' features columns touching on various subjects such as celebrities, fashion and beauty, food and drink, homes and gardens or simply writers' anecdotes. Notable contributors include [[Giles Coren]], Food and Drink Writer of the Year in 2005 and [[Nadiya Hussain]], winner of BBC's [[The Great British Bake Off]].

At the time of Harold Evans' appointment as editor in 1981, ''The Times'' had an average daily sale of 282,000 copies in comparison to the 1.4 million daily sales of its traditional rival ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]''.<ref name="Stewart, p 51"/> By November 2005 ''The Times'' sold an average of 691,283 copies per day, the second-highest of any British "[[Quality press|quality]]" newspaper (after ''The Daily Telegraph'', which had a circulation of 903,405 copies in the period), and the highest in terms of full-rate sales.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://media.guardian.co.uk/presspublishing/tables/0,,1665378,00.html |title=National daily newspaper circulation November 2005 |accessdate=13 February 2012 |newspaper=The Guardian |location=London |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121114030359/http://media.guardian.co.uk/presspublishing/tables/0,,1665378,00.html |archivedate=14 November 2012 }}</ref> By March 2014, average daily circulation of ''The Times'' had fallen to 394,448 copies,<ref name="circ"/> compared to ''The Daily Telegraph'''s 523,048,<ref name="Telegraph">{{cite web|title=The Daily Telegraph - readership data|url= http://www.newsworks.org.uk/The-Daily-Telegraph|publisher=News Works|accessdate=12 April 2014}}</ref> with the two retaining respectively the second-highest and highest circulations among British "quality" newspapers.

==Typeface==
{{quote|[T]he various typefaces used before the introduction (The) Times New Roman {{sic}} didn't really have a formal name.

They were a suite of types originally made by Miller and Co. (later Miller & Richards) in Edinburgh around 1813, generally referred to as "modern". When The Times began using Monotype (and other hot-metal machines) in 1908, this design was remade by Monotype for its equipment. As near as I can tell, it looks like Monotype Series no. 1 — Modern (which was based on a Miller & Richards typeface) — was what was used up until 1932.|Dan Rhatigan, type director<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ultrasparky.org/archives/2011/08/it_was_never_ca.html|title=Ultrasparky: It was never called Times Old Roman|publisher=}}</ref>|multiline=yes}}
[[File:Times New Roman-sample.svg|thumb|right|An example of the ''[[Times New Roman]]'' typeface]]
In 1908, ''The Times'' started using the ''Monotype Modern'' typeface.<ref>{{cite book|title=A Tally of Types|author=Morison|year=1953|publisher=Cambridge University Press|page=15}}</ref>

''The Times'' commissioned the [[serif]] [[typeface]] ''[[Times New Roman]]'', created by [[Victor Lardent]] at the English branch of [[Monotype Corporation|Monotype]], in 1931.<ref name="loxley">{{cite book|last=Loxley|first=Simon|title=Type: the secret history of letters |publisher=I. B. Tauris & Co. Ltd|year=2006|pages=130–131|isbn=1-84511-028-5}}</ref> It was commissioned after [[Stanley Morison]] had written an article criticizing ''The Times'' for being badly printed and typographically antiquated.<ref name="oxdnb">{{cite book |last=Carter|first=H. G.|others=rev. David McKitterick |title='Morison, Stanley Arthur (1889–1967)' |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|year=2004|volume=[[Oxford Dictionary of National Biography]]}}</ref> The font was supervised by Morison and drawn by Victor Lardent, an artist from the advertising department of ''The Times''. Morison used an older font named [[Plantin (typeface)|Plantin]] as the basis for his design, but made revisions for legibility and economy of space. ''Times New Roman'' made its debut in the issue of 3 October 1932.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.typolis.de/version1/engl/ftimes.htm |title=TYPOlis: Times New Roman |publisher=Typolis.de |date=3 October 1932 |accessdate=8 April 2014}}</ref> After one year, the design was released for commercial sale. ''The Times'' stayed with ''Times New Roman'' for 40 years, but new production techniques and the format change from [[broadsheet]] to [[tabloid (newspaper format)|tabloid]] in 2004 have caused the newspaper to switch font five times since 1972. However, all the new fonts have been variants of the original New Roman font:
* ''Times Europa'' was designed by [[Walter Tracy]] in 1972 for The Times, as a sturdier alternative to the Times font family, designed for the demands of faster printing presses and cheaper paper. The typeface features more open counter spaces.
* ''Times Roman'' replaced Times Europa on 30 August 1982.<ref name="Driver2006">{{cite news |last1=Driver |first1=David |title=After 221 years, the world's leading newspaper shows off a fresh face |url=https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/after-221-years-the-worlds-leading-newspaper-shows-off-a-fresh-face-vxs5wkc0ch6 |accessdate=23 June 2018 |work=The Times |date=20 November 2006 |subscription=y}}</ref>
* ''Times Millennium'' was made in 1991,<ref name="Driver2006" /> drawn by Gunnlaugur Briem on the instructions of Aurobind Patel, composing manager of News International.

* ''Times Modern'' was unveiled on 20 November 2006, as the successor of ''Times Classic''.<ref name="Driver2006" /> Designed for improving legibility in smaller font sizes, it uses 45-degree angled bracket serifs. The font was published by Elsner + Flake as ''EF Times Modern''; it was designed by Research Studios, led by Ben Preston (deputy editor of The Times) and designer Neville Brody.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.prnewswire.co.uk/cgi/news/release?id=184449 |title=Neville Brody's Research Studios Creates New Font and Design Changes for The Times as Compact Format Continues to Attract Loyal Readership |location=LONDON |publisher=Prnewswire.co.uk |date=15 November 2006 |accessdate=8 April 2014}}</ref>

==Political allegiance==
Historically, the paper was not overtly pro-[[Tory]] or [[Whigs (British political party)|Whig]], but has been a long time bastion of the [[The Establishment#Britain|English Establishment]] and empire. ''The Times'' adopted a stance described as "peculiarly detached" at the [[United Kingdom general election, 1945|1945 general election]]; although it was increasingly critical of the Conservative Party's campaign, it did not advocate a vote for any one party.<ref>R. B. McCallum and Alison Readman, "The British General Election of 1945", Oxford University Press, 1947, p.&nbsp;181–2.</ref> However, the newspaper reverted to the Tories for the [[United Kingdom general election, 1950|next election]] five years later. It supported the Conservatives for the subsequent three elections, followed by support for both the Conservatives and the [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Party]] for the next five elections, expressly supporting a Con-Lib coalition in 1974. The paper then backed the Conservatives solidly until 1997, when it declined to make any party endorsement but supported individual (primarily [[Euroscepticism|Eurosceptic]]) candidates.<ref>[[David Butler (psephologist)|David Butler]] and Dennis Kavanagh, "The British General Election of 1997", Macmillan, London, 1997, p. 156.</ref>

For the [[United Kingdom general election, 2001|2001 general election]] ''The Times'' declared its support for [[Tony Blair]]'s Labour government, which was re-elected by a landslide (although not as large as in 1997). It supported Labour again in [[United Kingdom general election, 2005|2005]], when Labour achieved a third successive win, though with a reduced majority.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.supanet.com/business--money/which-political-parties-do-the-newspapers-support--25923p1.html|title=Which political parties do the newspapers support? |publisher=Supanet|accessdate=27 October 2010}}</ref> In 2004, according to [[Ipsos MORI|MORI]], the voting intentions of its readership were 40% for the Conservative Party, 29% for the [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrats]], and 26% for Labour.<ref name="MORI survey">{{cite web|url=http://www.ipsos-mori.com/researchpublications/researcharchive/755/Voting-Intention-by-Newspaper-Readership.aspx|title=Voting intention by newspaper readership|date=9 March 2005|publisher=Ipsos Mori|accessdate=18 July 2009}}</ref> For the [[United Kingdom general election, 2010|2010 general election]], the newspaper declared its support for the Conservatives once again; the election ended in the Tories taking the most votes and seats but having to form a [[coalition]] with the [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrats]] in order to form a government as they had failed to gain an overall majority.<ref>{{cite news|last=Stoddard|first=Katy |url=https://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/2010/may/04/general-election-newspaper-support |title=Newspaper support in UK general elections|newspaper=The Guardian|location=London|date=4 May 2010|accessdate=27 October 2010}}</ref>

This makes it the most varied newspaper in terms of political support in British history.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/2010/may/04/general-election-newspaper-support|location=London|newspaper=The Guardian|first=Katy|last=Stoddard|title=Newspaper support in UK general elections|date=4 May 2010}}</ref> Some columnists in ''The Times'' are connected to the Conservative Party such as [[Daniel Finkelstein]], [[Tim Montgomerie]], [[Matthew Parris]] and [[Matt Ridley]], but there are also columnists connected to the Labour Party such as [[David Aaronovitch]], [[Philip Collins (journalist)|Philip Collins]], and [[Jenni Russell]].

''The Times'' occasionally makes endorsements for foreign elections. In November 2012, it endorsed a second term for [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]]'s [[Barack Obama]] although it also expressed reservations about his foreign policy.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/opinion/leaders/article3586085.ece|location=London|newspaper=The Times|title=America Decides|date=1 November 2012}}</ref>

==Sponsorships==

''The Times'', along with the [[British Film Institute]], sponsors "The Times" ''bfi'' [[London Film Festival]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/3116646.stm|title=Female stars lead London festival|accessdate=20 July 2012|publisher=BBC News| date=17 September 2003|first=Neil|last=Smith}}</ref> It also sponsors the [[Cheltenham Literature Festival]] and the [[Asia House Festival of Asian Literature]] at [[Asia House]], London. In addition, the newspaper has previously acted as a media partner for [[Teach First]], notably at their Impact Conference in 2017.
