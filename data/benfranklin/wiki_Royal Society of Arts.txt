'''The Royal Society for the Encouragement of Arts, Manufactures and Commerce''' ('''RSA''') is a [[London]]-based, British organisation committed to finding practical solutions to social challenges.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thersa.org/about-us|title=About the RSA}}</ref> Founded in 1754 by [[William Shipley]] as the Society for the Encouragement of Arts, Manufacture and Commerce, it was granted a [[Royal Charter]] in 1847,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thersa.org/about-us/history-and-archive/rsa-history-timeline|title=History of the RSA|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081201183144/http://www.thersa.org/about-us/history-and-archive/rsa-history-timeline|archivedate=1 December 2008|df=dmy-all}}</ref> and the right to use the term ''Royal'' in its name by [[Edward VII of the United Kingdom|King Edward VII]] in 1908.<ref name=na>{{cite web|url=http://nationalarchives.gov.uk/nra/lists/GB-0403-RSA.htm|title=The Royal Society for the Encouragement of Arts, Manufactures and Commerce: records|author=|date=|website=nationalarchives.gov.uk}}</ref> The shorter version, '''The Royal Society of Arts''' and the related '''RSA''' acronym, are used more frequently than the full name.

Notable past fellows include [[Charles Dickens]], [[Benjamin Franklin]], [[Stephen Hawking]], [[Karl Marx]], [[Adam Smith]], [[Nelson Mandela]], [[David Attenborough]], [[William Hogarth]], [[John Diefenbaker]], and [[Tim Berners-Lee]]. Today, the RSA has [[Fellows of the Royal Society of Arts|Fellows]] elected from 80 countries worldwide.

The RSA award three medals, the [[Albert Medal (RSA)|Albert Medal]], the [[Benjamin Franklin Medal (Royal Society of Arts)|Benjamin Franklin Medal]] (following a decision by the Board in 2013, the Benjamin Franklin Medal is now overseen by the RSA US, although the final nomination is ratified by the UK Board) and the Bicentenary Medal. Medal winners include [[Nelson Mandela]], [[Frank Whittle|Sir Frank Whittle]], and [[Professor]] [[Stephen Hawking]]. The RSA members are innovative contributors to the human knowledge, as shown by the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'', which records the first use of the term "[[sustainability]]" in an environmental sense of the word in the ''RSA Journal'' in 1980.

==Name and mission==
[[File:Royal Society of Arts 20130414 158.jpg|thumb|Royal Society of Arts, front of the building]]

On the RSA building's frieze ''The Royal Society of Arts'' words (see photograph) are engraved, although its full name is ''Royal Society for the encouragement of Arts, Manufactures and Commerce''. The short name and the related R(oyal) S(ociety) of A(rts) abbreviation is used more frequently than the full name.

The RSA's mission expressed in the founding charter was to "embolden enterprise, enlarge science, refine art, improve our manufacturers and extend our commerce", but also of the need to alleviate poverty and secure [[full employment]]. On its website, the RSA characterises itself as "an enlightenment organisation committed to finding innovative practical solutions to today’s social challenges".

==Prizes==
Originally modelled on the [[Royal Dublin Society|Dublin Society for improving Husbandry, Manufacturers and other Useful Arts]], the RSA, from its foundation, offered ''prizes'' through a Premium Award Scheme that continued for 100 years. Medals and, in some cases, money were awarded to individuals who achieved success in published challenges within the categories of Agriculture, Polite Arts, Manufacture, Colonies and Trade, Chemistry and Mechanics. Successful submission included agricultural improvements in the cultivation of crops and reforestation, devising new forms of machinery, including an extendable ladder to aid firefighting that has remained in use relatively unchanged, and artistic skill, through submissions by young students, many of whom developed into famous artists i.e. [[Edwin Landseer]] who at the age of 10 was awarded a silver medal for his drawing of a dog.

The RSA originally specifically precluded premiums for [[patent]]ed solutions.<ref>http://sitoc.biz/adelphicharter/pdfs/RSA_IP_Final.pdf</ref> Today the RSA continues to offer premiums.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thersa.org/action-research-centre/enterprise-and-design/enterprise/premiums|title=RSA Premiums}}</ref>

In 1936, the RSA awarded the first distinctions of [[Royal Designers for Industry]] (RDI or HonRDI), reserved for "those very few who in the judgment of their peers have achieved 'sustained excellence in aesthetic and efficient design for industry'".

In 1937 "The Faculty of Royal Designers for Industry" was established as an association with the object of "furthering excellence in design and its application to industrial purposes": membership of the Faculty is automatic for (and exclusive to) all RDIs and HonRDIs. The Faculty currently has 120 Royal Designers (RDI) and 45 Honorary Royal Designers (non-UK citizens who are awarded the accolade of HonRDI): the number of designers who may hold the distinction of RDI at any one time is strictly limited.

The Faculty consists of the world’s leading practitioners from fields as disparate as engineering, furniture, fashion and textiles, graphics, theater and film design. Early members include [[Eric Gill]], [[Enid Marx]], Sir [[Frank Whittle]] and numerous other household names.

==RSA House==
[[File:Mathew Taylor on the RSA.ogg|thumb|Audio description of the building by [[Matthew Taylor (Labour politician)|Mathew Taylor]]]]
The RSA moved to its current home in 1774. The House, situated in John Adam Street, near [[Strand, London|the Strand]] in central London, had been purpose-designed by the Adam Brothers ([[James Adam (architect)|James Adam]] and [[Robert Adam]]) as part of their innovative Adelphi scheme. The original building (6–8 John Adam Street) includes the Great Room, which features a magnificent sequence of paintings by Irish artist [[James Barry (painter)|James Barry]] titled ''The Progress of Human Knowledge and Culture'' and portraits of the Society's first and second presidents, painted by [[Thomas Gainsborough]] and [[Joshua Reynolds]] respectively.

The RSA has expanded into adjacent buildings, and now includes 2 and 4 John Adam Street and 18 Adam Street. The first occupant of 18 Adam Street was the Adelphi Tavern, which is mentioned in Dickens's ''[[The Pickwick Papers]]''. The former private dining room of the Tavern contains a magnificent Adam ceiling with painted roundels by the school of Kauffman and Zucchi.

A major refurbishment in 2012 by Matthew Lloyd Architects won a [[Royal Institute of British Architects|RIBA]] London Award in 2013, and a RIBA [[English Heritage]] Award for Sustaining the Historic Environment, also in 2013.<ref>[http://www.matthewlloyd.co.uk/projects/the-royal-society-of-arts/ The Royal Society of Arts], Matthew Lloyd Architects. Retrieved 11 January 2016.</ref>

The RSA devised a scheme for commemorating the links between famous people and buildings, by placing plaques on the walls — these continue today as "[[blue plaque]]s" which have been administered by a range of government bodies. The first of these plaques was, in fact, of red terracotta erected outside a former residence of [[Lord Byron]] (since demolished). The Society erected 36 plaques until, in 1901, responsibility for them was transferred to the [[London County Council]] (which changed the colour of the plaques to the current blue) and, later, the [[Greater London Council]] (the G.L.C.) and, most recently, English Heritage. Similar schemes are now operated in all the [[Constituent countries of the United Kingdom|constituent countries]] of the [[United Kingdom]].

==Associated organisations==
The origin of London's [[Royal Academy of Arts]] lies in an attempt in 1755 by members of the RSA (then simply known as the Society for the Encouragement of Arts, Manufactures and Commerce), principally the sculptor [[Henry Cheere]], to found an autonomous academy of arts to teach painting and sculpture. Prior to this a number of artists were members of the RSA, including Cheere and [[William Hogarth]], or were involved in small-scale private art academies, such as the [[St Martin's Lane Academy]]. Although Cheere's attempt failed, the eventual [[charter]], called an 'Instrument', used to establish the Royal Academy of Arts over a decade later was almost identical to that drawn up by Cheere and the RSA in 1755.<ref>Gordon Sutton, ''Artisan or Artist?: A History of the Teaching of Art and Crafts in English Schools'' (London: Pergamon Press, 2014) p.297</ref> The RSA also hosted the first ''exhibition of contemporary art'' in 1760. Thomas Gainsborough and Joshua Reynolds were among those who exhibited at this first exhibition, and were subsequently founder members of The [[Royal Academy of Arts]] in 1768.

The Society was a pioneer in examinations, offering the first national public examinations in 1882 that led to the formation of the RSA Examinations Board now included in the [[OCR (examination board)|Oxford, Cambridge and RSA Examinations Board]].

In 1876, a predecessor of the [[Royal College of Music]], the ''National Training School for Music'', was founded by the RSA.<ref>[https://www.jstor.org/stable/41378132?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents Jstor.Org RSA Journal Vol 140 Page 203, February 1992] Retrieved 19 July 2018</ref>

In 1929 The Society purchased the entire village of [[West Wycombe]]. After extensive repairs, the village was legally conveyed by deed to the [[National Trust for Places of Historic Interest or Natural Beauty|National Trust]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2017}}

In 1936, the RSA awarded the first distinctions of [[Royal Designers for Industry]] (RDI or HonRDI), reserved for "those very few who in the judgment of their peers have achieved 'sustained excellence in aesthetic and efficient design for industry'".

==Activities==
In Great Britain and Ireland, the RSA offers regional activities to encourage Fellows to address local topics of interest and to connect with other Fellows in their locality. The UK Regions are: London, Central, North, Scotland, South East, South West, Wales and, Ireland. The RSA has a presence around the world under its RSA Global scheme with a notable presence in Australia, New Zealand and the USA.<ref name=Fellowship>[https://www.thersa.org/fellowship/in-your-area/international "Fellowship"], RSA.

===Events===

The RSA's public events programme is a key part of its charitable mission to make world-changing ideas and debate freely available to all.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thersa.org/events/about-events|title=About RSA events|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140328204520/http://www.thersa.org/events/about-events|archivedate=28 March 2014|df=dmy-all}}</ref> Over 100 keynote lectures, panel discussions, debates, and documentary screenings are held each year, many of which are live-streamed over the web.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLMo9vqiZPs0SuX-Xsj56_Drfw8V8O43MZ|title=RSA Replay channel on Youtube}}</ref> Events are free and open to the public, and mp3 audio files<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thersa.org/events/audio-and-past-events|title=Audio and past events|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100315110127/http://www.thersa.org/events/audio-and-past-events|archivedate=15 March 2010|df=dmy-all}}</ref> and videos<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thersa.org/events/vision|title=RSA videos|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091030233056/http://www.thersa.org/events/vision|archivedate=30 October 2009|df=dmy-all}}</ref> are made available on the RSA's website and YouTube page.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/user/theRSAorg|title=RSA channel on Youtube}}</ref>

Renowned thinkers and doers have been invited to present their ideas on the RSA's stage ever since the society was founded in the 18th century "age of enlightenment". More recent speakers have included [[Sir Ken Robinson]], [[Al Gore]], [[Sir David Attenborough]], [[Alain de Botton]], [[Michael Sandel]], [[Nassim Nicholas Taleb]], [[Martha Nussbaum]], [[Desmond Tutu]], [[Steven Pinker]], [[Susan Cain]], [[Dan Pink]], [[Dan Ariely]], [[Brene Brown]], [[Slavoj Zizek]], [[David Cameron]], and [[Dambisa Moyo]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thersa.org/events/speakers|title=RSA Events Speakers|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100327203035/http://www.thersa.org/events/speakers|archivedate=27 March 2010|df=dmy-all}}</ref>

The choice of speaker for the recent annual Presidential lecture has been a matter of interest in the press.<ref>{{cite web

As president of the RSA, Prince Philip's first choice of speaker was Ian Plimer, professor of mineral geology at Adelaide University, but this was rejected as too controversial, as Plimer argues that the theory of Anthropogenic Global Warming is unproven.

On 14 January 2010, the RSA in partnership with Arts Council England hosted a one-day conference in London called "State of the Arts".<ref>[http://www.thersa.org/events/state-of-the-arts-conference State of the Arts Conference], RSA.</ref> A number of speakers from various disciplines from art to government gathered to talk about the state of the arts industry in the United Kingdom. Notable speakers included [[Jeremy Hunt (politician)|Jeremy Hunt]] MP, Secretary of State for Culture, Media & Sport and his counterpart [[Ben Bradshaw]] MP, who was then the Secretary of State for Culture, Media & Sport. Notably, Jeremy Hunt stated that if the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative party]] won the next elections then government funding for the arts would be cut.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2010/jan/14/arts-funding-cuts-proposed-conservatives|work=[[The Guardian]]|location=London|title=Arts funding cuts proposed by Conservatives|first=Charlotte|last=Higgins|date=14 January 2010|accessdate=22 May 2010}}</ref>

===Projects===
During the 1980s, the RSA worked with the [[Comino Foundation]] and established a Comino Fellowship Committee 'to change the cultural attitude to industry from one of lack of interest or dislike to one of concern and esteem'. This eventually led to a joint government/industry initiative to promote 1986 as "Industry Year",<ref>Sir Geoffrey Chandler CBE, (1985) "Industry Year 1986", ''Industrial Management & Data Systems,'' Vol. 85 Issue: 5/6, pp.6–10</ref><ref>Anne Powell (1986) "The Industry Year Attack", ''Production Engineer'' vol. 65. Issue: 1, pp.13–14.</ref> with the RSA and the Comino Foundation providing core funding of £250,000 – which persuaded the [[Confederation of British Industry]] to raise £1 million and government departments to provide £3 million.<ref name="Darbyshire">Darbyshire, Anthony, and Duckworth, Eric (2011), [http://www.cominofoundation.org.uk/PDF/Demetrius_Comino_a_life_and_legacy_of_achievement.pdf ''Demetrius Comino: A life and legacy of achievement''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130514235835/http://www.cominofoundation.org.uk/PDF/Demetrius_Comino_a_life_and_legacy_of_achievement.pdf |date=14 May 2013 }}, Comino Foundation. Retrieved 22 February 2012.</ref>

In July 2008, the RSA became a sponsor of an [[Academy (English school)|academy]] in [[Tipton]], The [[RSA Academy]], which opened in September 2008. New buildings are currently under construction to designs by [[John McAslan and Partners]]. Current projects include Arts and Ecology, Citizen Power, Connected Communities, Design and Society, Education, Public Services, Social Brain, and Technology in a Cold Climate.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thersa.org/projects|title=RSA Projects|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100310020748/http://www.thersa.org/projects|archivedate=10 March 2010|df=dmy-all}}</ref> There are seven schools in the RSA Family of Academies, all in the West Midlands, including The RSA Academy and [[Whitley Academy]].<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.rsaacademiesteachingschool.org.uk/about-us/our-academies/ | title=Our Academies | publisher=Royal Society of Arts | work=RSA Teaching School Alliance | accessdate=18 November 2017}}</ref>

Past projects include delivering fresh drinking water to the developing world, rethinking intellectual property from first principles to produce a Charter (published as the [[Adelphi Charter]]), investigating schemes to manage international migration and exploring the feasibility of a UK-wide [[personal carbon trading]] system. It still promotes the practice of inclusive design, and is working with artists to communicate ideas about environmental sustainability (for example, through one of the RSA's past projects, [[WEEE Man]], and currently through the Arts and Ecology project).
