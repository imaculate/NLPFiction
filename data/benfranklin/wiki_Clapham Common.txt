'''Clapham Common''' is a large triangular [[urban park]] in [[Clapham]], south London. Originally [[common land]] for the parishes of Battersea and Clapham, it was converted to parkland under the terms of the [[Metropolitan Commons Act 1878]]. It is {{convert|220|acre|ha|abbr=off}}<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.visitlondon.com/attractions/outdoors/heaths-and-commons |title=London's heaths and commons |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090410074327/http://www.visitlondon.com/attractions/outdoors/heaths-and-commons |publisher= visitlondon.com |archivedate=10 April 2009 |accessdate=13 March 2010}}</ref> of green space, with three ponds and a Victorian bandstand. It is overlooked by large Georgian and Victorian mansions and nearby Clapham Old Town.

Holy Trinity Clapham, an 18th-century [[Georgian architecture|Georgian]] church overlooking the park, is important in the history of the evangelical [[Clapham Sect]]. Half of the park is within the [[London Borough of Wandsworth]], and the other half is within the [[London Borough of Lambeth]].

==History==
[[File:View on Clapham Common by Turner.jpg|thumb|left|View on Clapham Common by [[J. M. W. Turner]] (1800-1805)]]

Originally common land for the parishes of Battersea and Clapham, [[William Hewer]] was among the early Londoners to build adjacent to it. [[Samuel Pepys]], the diarist, died at Hewer's house in 1703. The land had been used for [[cricket]] in 1700<ref>Waghorn HT (1906) ''The Dawn of Cricket'', p.4. Electric Press.</ref> and was drained in the 1760s,<ref name=drain/> and from the 1790s onwards fine houses were built around the common as fashionable dwellings for wealthy business people in what was then a village detached from metropolitan London. Some later residents were members of the Clapham Sect of evangelical reformers, including [[John Shore, 1st Baron Teignmouth|Lord Teignmouth]] and [[Henry Thornton (abolitionist)|Henry Thornton]], the banker and [[Abolitionism in the United Kingdom|abolitionist]]. In 1911, Scottish evangelist and teacher Oswald Chambers (1874-1917) founded and was principal of the Bible Training College in Clapham Common, an "embarrassingly elegant" property situated at 45 North Side that had been purchased by the Pentecostal League of Prayer.<ref>McCasland, David (1993). Oswald Chambers: Abandoned To God : the life story of the author of My Utmost for His Highest. Grand Rapids, Michigan: Discovery House Publishers. {{ISBN|1-57293-050-0}}</ref> Excerpts of Chambers weekly addresses to the student body at the college were published in 1934 by his wife Gertrude (Biddy) Hobbs in the book My Utmost For His Highest, perhaps one of the most widely read Christian devotional books (39 languages, 13 million copies).<ref>"My Utmost for His Highest - Available Translations". Oswald Chambers. Retrieved 4 January 2013.. Among Chambers' readers was George W. Bush. D. Jason Berggren and Nicol C. Rae, "Jimmy Carter and George W. Bush, Foreign Policy, and an Evangelical Presidential Style," Presidential Studies Quarterly, 36:4 (December 2006), 615.</ref>

J. M. W. Turner painted "View on Clapham Common" between 1800 and 1805, showing that even though the common had been drained, it still remained "quite a wild place".<ref name=drain>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MynSOYoMVzkC&pg=PA121#v=onepage&q&f=false|title=Common Land in English Painting, 1700-1850|page=121|author=Ian Waites|publisher=Boydell Press|date= 2012}}</ref>

The common was converted to parkland under the terms of the Metropolitan Commons Act in 1878. As London expanded in the 19th century, Clapham was absorbed into the capital, with most of the remaining palatial or agricultural estates replaced with terraced housing by the early 1900s. During [[World War II]], storage bunkers were built on the Battersea Rise side of the common; two mounds remain.{{citation needed|reason=purpose was storage bunkers|date=December 2018}}

==Governance==
Half of the common is within the London Borough of Wandsworth and half within the London Borough of Lambeth. It is wholly managed and maintained by the London Borough of Lambeth, while the policing of the open space is divided between the Wandsworth and Lambeth borough "commands" of the [[Metropolitan Police]], which follow the local government boundaries. The roads surrounding the common fall within the SW4 post code.

== Local government elections ==
Clapham Common is in the [[Clapham Common (ward)|Clapham Common electoral ward]].

In 2010, residents of the Clapham Common ward elected two [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] Councillors & one [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Lib Dem]] Councillor.

In 2014, residents of the Clapham Common ward elected 3 Conservative Councillors.
This was the first time the Conservatives had taken control of the Clapham Common ward since the 1960s.

In 2018, residents elected 2 Labour & 1 Conservative councillor.

==Amenities==
Clapham Common has a range of sporting facilities, including a running track, bowling green, cricket, football, rugby and Australian rules football pitches, and a skateboard venue.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lambeth.gov.uk/places/clapham-common|title=Clapham Common Facilities and services|publisher=lambeth.gov.uk}}</ref> The park contains three ponds, two of which are historical features, and a more modern paddling pool known as Cock Pond. Eagle Pond and Mount Pond are used for [[angling]] and contain a variety of species including [[carp]] to 20&nbsp;lb, [[Rutilus|roach]], [[tench]] and [[bream]]. Eagle Pond was extensively refurbished in 2002 when it was completely drained, landscaped and replanted to provide a better habitat for the fish it contained. Long Pond has a century-old tradition of use for model boating.

Holy Trinity Church (1776) is close to the north side of the park. An [[Anglicanism|Anglican]] church, it hosts its fete in the park every summer.

[[Clapham Common tube station|Clapham Common]] and [[Clapham South tube station|Clapham South]] Underground stations are on the edge of the common at its easternmost and southernmost points respectively. Both stations are served by the [[Northern line]].

A memorial tree to actor [[Jeremy Brett]] – who had lived locally for many years prior to his death in 1995 – was planted on 30 March 2007.

==The bandstand==
[[Image:Clapham Common bandstand.jpg|thumb|Clapham Common bandstand after renovation in 2006]]

In the centre of the park is a bandstand constructed in 1890. It is the largest bandstand in London and a Grade II [[Listed Building]]. For many years it was also erroneously thought to be one of the bandstands first erected in 1861 in the [[Royal Horticultural Society]]'s gardens in [[South Kensington]], which would have made it the oldest surviving cast iron bandstand in Europe. However, recent research has shown that these bandstands went to [[Southwark Park]] and [[Peckham Rye]], and it appears that the Clapham bandstand was fabricated to a very similar design almost thirty years later.

The bandstand's maintenance had been neglected by Lambeth Council for thirty years, and by 2001 it was thought to be in danger of collapse and had to be shored up with scaffolding for five years. In 2005–2006, a full restoration of the bandstand and surrounding landscape took place, partly funded by an £895,000 lottery grant from the [[Heritage Lottery Fund]] matched by £300,000 from Lambeth Council and a further £100,000 from local fundraising efforts and the proceeds of the ''Ben and Jerry's Summer Sundae'' event held on the Common. The drainage bund around the bandstand was restored with granite setts during the summer of 2011 at a cost of £12,000<ref>[http://www.lambeth.gov.uk/NR/rdonlyres/83390CD7-8196-4264-BD5E-B3493BF95881/0/Ward_Purse_Committed_Projects_201011.pdf LB Lambeth Ward Purse committed projects] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120130015315/http://www.lambeth.gov.uk/NR/rdonlyres/83390CD7-8196-4264-BD5E-B3493BF95881/0/Ward_Purse_Committed_Projects_201011.pdf |date=30 January 2012 }}</ref> to resolve design faults in the earlier works.

[[Benjamin Franklin]] used the ponds for science experiments, and developing a "magic" trick. While traveling on a ship, Franklin had observed that the wake of a ship was diminished when the cooks scuttled their greasy water. He studied the effects at Clapham common on a large pond there. "I fetched out a cruet of oil and dropt a little of it on the water ... though not more than a teaspoon full, produced an instant calm over a space of several yards square." He later used the trick to "calm the waters" by carrying "a little oil in the hollow joint of my cane."<ref>W. Gratzer, ''Eurekas and Euphorias'', pp. 80, 81</ref>
