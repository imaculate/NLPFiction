According to the [[Hebrew Bible]], he was adopted by an Egyptian princess, and later in life became the leader of the Israelites and [[Law of Moses|lawgiver]], to whom the [[Mosaic authorship|authorship]] of the [[Torah]], or acquisition of the Torah from Heaven is traditionally attributed. Also called ''Moshe Rabbenu'' in Hebrew ({{lang |he|מֹשֶׁה רַבֵּנוּ}}, ''[[Literal translation|lit.]]'' "Moses our Teacher"), he is the most important prophet in [[Judaism]].<ref name="aaa">{{Bibleref |Deuteronomy|34:10|KJV}}</ref><ref>{{Citation | author= Maimonides | author-link = Maimonides | title = 13 principles of faith | at = 7th principle| title-link = Maimonedes#The 13 principles of faith }}.</ref> He is also an important prophet in [[Prophets of Christianity|Christianity]], [[prophets in Islam|Islam]], the [[Bahá'í Faith]], and a number of [[Abrahamic religions#Other Abrahamic religions|other Abrahamic religions]].

According to the [[Book of Exodus]], Moses was born in a time when his people, the [[Israelites]], an enslaved minority, were increasing in numbers and the [[Pharaoh of the Exodus|Egyptian Pharaoh]] was worried that they might ally themselves with Egypt's enemies.<ref>Exodus 1:10</ref> Moses' [[Hebrews|Hebrew]] mother, [[Jochebed]], secretly hid him when the Pharaoh ordered all newborn Hebrew boys to be killed in order to reduce the population of the Israelites.

God sent Moses back to Egypt to demand the release of the Israelites from slavery. Moses said that he could not speak eloquently,<ref>Exodus 4:10</ref> so God allowed [[Aaron]], his brother, to become his spokesperson. After the [[Plagues of Egypt|Ten Plagues]], Moses led the [[The Exodus|Exodus of the Israelites]] out of Egypt and [[Crossing the Red Sea|across the Red Sea]], after which they based themselves at [[Biblical Mount Sinai|Mount Sinai]], where Moses received the [[Ten Commandments]].

The [[Israelites]] had settled in the [[Land of Goshen]] in the time of [[Joseph (patriarch)|Joseph]] and [[Jacob]], but a new pharaoh arose who oppressed the children of Israel. At this time Moses was born to his father [[Amram]], son of [[Kehath]] the [[Levite]], who entered Egypt with Jacob's household; his mother was [[Jochebed]] (also Yocheved), who was kin to Kehath.

After defeating the [[Amalekites]] in [[Rephidim]], Moses [[The Exodus|led the Israelites]] to [[biblical Mount Sinai]], where he was given the [[Ten Commandments]] from God, written on [[Stele|stone tablets]]. However, since Moses remained a long time on the mountain, some of the people feared that he might be dead, so they made a statue of a [[golden calf]] and [[Sacred bull|worshiped it]], thus disobeying and angering God and Moses. Moses, out of anger, broke the tablets, and later ordered the elimination of those who had worshiped the golden statue, which was melted down and fed to the [[Idolatry|idolaters]].<ref>{{Cite book| publisher = James Clarke| isbn = 978-0-227-17379-4| last1 = Rad| first1 = Gerhard von| last2 = Hanson| first2 = K.

Later at Mount Sinai, Moses and the elders entered into a covenant, by which Israel would become the people of YHWH, obeying his laws, and YHWH would be their god. Moses delivered the laws of God to Israel, instituted [[Kohen|the priesthood]] under the sons of Moses' brother [[Aaron]], and destroyed those Israelites who fell away from his worship. In his final act at Sinai, God gave Moses instructions for the [[Tabernacle]], the mobile shrine by which he would travel with Israel to the Promised Land.<ref>Ginzberg, Louis (1909). ''[http://www.swartzentrover.com/cotor/e-books/misc/Legends/Legends%20of%20the%20Jews.pdf The Legends of the Jews Vol III : The Symbolical Significance of the Tabernacle]'' (Translated by Henrietta Szold) Philadelphia: Jewish Publication Society.</ref>

From Sinai, Moses led the Israelites to the [[Desert of Paran]] on the border of Canaan. From there he sent [[The Twelve Spies|twelve spies]] into the land. The spies returned with samples of the land's fertility, but warned that its inhabitants were [[Giant (mythology)#Abrahamic mythology|giants]].  The people were afraid and wanted to return to Egypt, and some rebelled against Moses and against God.  Moses told the Israelites that they were not worthy to inherit the land, and would wander the wilderness for forty years until the generation who had refused to enter Canaan had died, so that it would be their children who would possess the land.<ref>Ginzberg, Louis (1909). ''[http://www.swartzentrover.com/cotor/e-books/misc/Legends/Legends%20of%20the%20Jews.pdf The Legends of the Jews Vol III : Ingratitude Punished]'' (Translated by Henrietta Szold) Philadelphia: Jewish Publication Society.</ref>

When the forty years had passed, Moses led the Israelites east around the [[Dead Sea]] to the territories of [[Edom]] and [[Moab]].  There they escaped the temptation of idolatry, conquered the lands of [[Og]] and [[Sihon]] in [[Transjordan (region)|Transjordan]], received God's blessing through [[Balaam]] the prophet, and massacred the [[Midian]]ites, who by the end of the Exodus journey had become the enemies of the Israelites due to their notorious role in enticing the Israelites to sin against God. Moses was twice given notice that he would die before entry to the Promised Land: in [[Book of Numbers|Numbers]] 27:13, once he had seen the Promised Land from a viewpoint on [[Abarim|Mount Abarim]], and again in Numbers 31:1 once battle with the Midianites had been won.

On the banks of the [[Jordan River]], in sight of the land, Moses assembled the [[Tribes of Israel#The Twelve Tribes|tribes]]. After recalling their wanderings he delivered God's laws by which they must live in the land, sang a [[Song of Moses|song]] of praise and pronounced a [[Blessing of Moses|blessing]] on the people, and passed his authority to [[Joshua]], under whom they would possess the land.  Moses then went up [[Mount Nebo]] to the top of [[Mount Pisgah (Bible)|Pisgah]], looked over the promised land of Israel spread out before him, and died, at the age of one hundred and twenty. More humble than any other man (Num. 12:3), "there hath not arisen a prophet since in Israel like unto Moses, whom [[Yahweh|YHWH]] knew face to face" ([[Book of Deuteronomy|Deuteronomy]] 34:10). The [[New Testament]] states that after Moses' death, [[Michael (archangel)|Michael the Archangel]] and the [[Devil]] disputed over his body ([[Epistle of Jude]] 1:9).

===Lawgiver of Israel===
{{Further information|Law of Moses|Mosaic authorship|Deuteronomist|Book of Deuteronomy#Deuteronomic code|613 Mitzvot}}
[[File:Rembrandt - Moses Smashing the Tablets of the Law - WGA19132.jpg|thumb|''[[Moses Breaking the Tablets of the Law]]'' by [[Rembrandt]]]]

Moses is honoured among [[Jews]] today as the "lawgiver of Israel", and he delivers several sets of laws in the course of the four books. The first is the [[Covenant Code]] ([[Book of Exodus|Exodus]] {{bibleverse-nb||Exodus|20:19|HE}}–{{bibleverse-nb||Exodus|23:33|HE}}), the terms of the [[Mosaic covenant|covenant]] which God offers to the Israelites at biblical Mount Sinai. Embedded in the covenant are the [[Decalogue]] (the [[Ten Commandments]], Exodus 20:1–17) and the Book of the Covenant (Exodus 20:22–23:19).{{sfn|Hamilton|2011|p=xxv}} The entire [[Book of Leviticus]] constitutes a second body of law, the [[Book of Numbers]] begins with yet another set, and the [[Book of Deuteronomy]] another. {{citation needed|reason=What is the primary source for this?|date=June 2016}}

Moses has traditionally been regarded as [[Mosaic authorship|the author of those four books]] and the [[Book of Genesis]], which together comprise the [[Torah]], the first section of the [[Hebrew Bible]].

==Historicity==

Dever]] "What Remains of the House That Albright Built?".

[[:de:wiki|Aidan Dodson]] regards this hypothesis as "intriguing, but beyond proof."<ref>[[:de:wiki|Aidan Dodson]], [https://books.google.it/books?id=DBnN9I8EvjsC&pg=PA72 ''Poisoned Legacy: The Fall of the 19th Egyptian Dynasty''] American University in Cairo Press 2010 p. 72.</ref>

The name [[Mesha|King Mesha]] of [[Moab]] has been linked to that of Moses. Mesha also is associated with narratives of an exodus and a conquest, and several motifs in stories about him are shared with the Exodus tale and that regarding Israel's war with Moab ([[Books of Kings|2 Kings]] 3). Moab rebels against oppression, like Moses, leads his people out of Israel, as Moses does from Egypt, and his first-born son is slaughtered at the wall of [[Kir of Moab|Kir-hareseth]] as the firstborn of Israel are condemned to slaughter in the Exodus story, "an infernal passover that delivers Mesha while wrath burns against his enemies".<ref>Peter J. Leithart, [https://books.google.it/books?id=Z_gvin9G7LgC&pg=PA181 ''1 & 2 Kings,''] Brazos Press, 2006 pp. 178ff [181–82].</ref>

An Egyptian version of the tale that crosses over with the Moses story is found in [[Manetho]] who,  according to the summary in [[Josephus]], wrote that a certain [[Osarseph]], a [[Heliopolis (Ancient Egypt)|Heliopolitan]] priest, became overseer of a band of [[Leprosy|lepers]], when [[Amenhotep III|Amenophis]], following indications by [[Amenhotep, son of Hapu]], had all the lepers in Egypt quarantined in order to cleanse the land so that he might see the gods. The lepers are bundled into [[Avaris]], the former capital of the [[Hyksos]], where Osarseph prescribes for them everything forbidden in Egypt, while proscribing everything permitted in Egypt. They invite the Hyksos to reinvade Egypt, rule with them for 13 years – Osarseph then assumes the name Moses – and are then driven out.<ref>[[Jan Assmann]], [https://books.google.it/books?id=IjUiie30Z9cC&pg=PA33 ''Moses the Egyptian: The Memory of Egypt in Western Monotheism,''] Harvard University Press, 2009 pp. 31–34.</ref>

==Moses in Hellenistic literature==
{{Further information|Moses in Judeo-Hellenistic literature}}
[[File:Memorial of Moses, Mt. Nebo.jpg|thumb|Memorial of Moses, [[Mount Nebo]], Jordan]]
Non-biblical writings about Jews, with references to the role of Moses, first appear at the beginning of the [[Hellenistic period]], from 323&nbsp;BCE to about 146&nbsp;BCE. Shmuel notes that "a characteristic of this literature is the high honour in which it holds the peoples of the East in general and some specific groups among these peoples."{{Sfn | Shmuel | 1976 | p = 1102}}

In addition to the Judeo-Roman or Judeo-Hellenic historians [[Artapanus of Alexandria|Artapanus]], [[Eupolemus]], [[Josephus]], and [[Philo]], a few non-Jewish historians including [[Hecataeus of Abdera]] (quoted by [[Diodorus Siculus]]), [[Alexander Polyhistor]], [[Manetho]], [[Apion]], [[Chaeremon of Alexandria]], [[Tacitus]] and [[Porphyry (philosopher)|Porphyry]] also make reference to him. The extent to which any of these accounts rely on earlier sources is unknown.{{Sfn | Shmuel | 1976 | p = 1103}} Moses also appears in other religious texts such as the [[Mishnah]] (c.&nbsp;200&nbsp;CE), [[Midrash]] (200–1200&nbsp;CE),<ref>{{Citation | last = Hammer | first = Reuven | title = The Classic Midrash: Tannaitic Commentaries on the Bible | publisher = Paulist Press | year = 1995 | page = 15}}.</ref> and the [[Quran]] (c. 610–653).{{citation needed|reason=Source needed for including the Quran in Hellenistic literature|date=June 2016}}

The figure of [[Osarseph]] in [[Greek historiography|Hellenistic historiography]] is a renegade Egyptian priest who leads an army of lepers against the pharaoh and is finally expelled from Egypt, changing his name to Moses.{{citation needed|reason=Source needed for this|date=June 2016}}

===In Hecataeus===
The earliest existing reference to Moses in Greek literature occurs in the Egyptian history of [[Hecataeus of Abdera]] (4th&nbsp;century&nbsp;BCE). All that remains of his description of Moses are two references made by [[Diodorus Siculus]], wherein, writes historian Arthur Droge, he "describes Moses as a wise and courageous leader who left Egypt and colonized [[Judea|Judaea]]."{{Sfn | Droge | 1989 | p = 18}}  Among the many accomplishments described by Hecataeus, Moses had founded cities, established a temple and religious cult, and issued laws:
{{Quote |After the establishment of settled life in Egypt in early times, which took place, according to the mythical account, in the period of the gods and heroes, the first... to persuade the multitudes to use written laws was Mneves [Moses], a man not only great of soul but also in his life the most public-spirited of all lawgivers whose names are recorded.{{Sfn | Droge | 1989 | p = 18}}}}

Droge also points out that this statement by Hecataeus was similar to statements made subsequently by [[Eupolemus]].{{Sfn | Droge | 1989 | p = 18}}

===In Artapanus===
[[File:The Knesset Menorah P5200010 Moses.JPG|thumb|Depiction of Moses on the [[Knesset Menorah]] raising his arms during the battle against the Amalekites]]
The Jewish historian [[Artapanus of Alexandria]] (2nd century BCE), portrayed Moses as a cultural hero, alien to the Pharaonic court. According to theologian John Barclay, the Moses of Artapanus "clearly bears the destiny of the Jews, and in his personal, cultural and military splendor, brings credit to the whole Jewish people."<ref>Barclay, John M. G. ''Jews in the Mediterranean Diaspora: From Alexander to Trajan (323&nbsp;BCE – 117&nbsp;CE)'', University of California Press (1996) p. 130</ref>
{{Quote | Jealousy of Moses' excellent qualities induced Chenephres to send him with unskilled troops on a military expedition to [[Ethiopia]], where he won great victories. After having built the city of [[Hermopolis]], he taught the people the value of the [[ibis]] as a protection against the serpents, making the bird the sacred guardian spirit of the city; then he introduced [[circumcision]]. After his return to [[Memphis, Egypt|Memphis]], Moses taught the people the value of oxen for agriculture, and the consecration of the same by Moses gave rise to the cult of [[Apis (deity)|Apis]]. Finally, after having escaped another plot by killing the assailant sent by the king, Moses fled to [[Arabian Peninsula|Arabia]], where he married the daughter of [[Jethro (Bible)|Raguel]] [Jethro], the ruler of the district.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=830&letter=M&search=moses#3 |title=Moses |website=Jewish Encyclopedia |accessdate= 2010-03-02}}</ref>}}

Artapanus goes on to relate how Moses returns to Egypt with Aaron, and is imprisoned, but miraculously escapes through the name of [[YHWH]] in order to lead the Exodus. This account further testifies that all Egyptian [[Egyptian temple|temples]] of [[Isis]] thereafter contained a rod, in remembrance of that used for Moses' miracles. He describes Moses as 80 years old, "tall and ruddy, with long white hair, and dignified."{{citation needed|reason=Citation needed for this part of the text|date=June 2016}}

Some historians, however, point out the "[[Apologetics|apologetic]] nature of much of Artapanus' work,"{{Sfn | Feldman | 1998 | p = 40}} with his addition of extra-biblical details, such as his references to Jethro: the non-Jewish Jethro expresses admiration for Moses' gallantry in helping his daughters, and chooses to adopt Moses as his son.{{Sfn | Feldman | 1998 | p = 133}}

===In Strabo===
[[Strabo]], a Greek historian, geographer and philosopher, in his ''[[Geographica]]'' (c.&nbsp;24&nbsp;CE), wrote in detail about Moses, whom he considered to be an Egyptian who deplored the situation in his homeland, and thereby attracted many followers who respected the deity. He writes, for example, that Moses opposed the picturing of the deity in the form of man or animal, and was convinced that the deity was an entity which encompassed everything – land and sea:{{Sfn | Shmuel | 1976 | p = 1132}}
{{blockquote|
35. An Egyptian priest named Moses, who possessed a portion of the country called the [[Lower Egypt]], being dissatisfied with the established institutions there, left it and came to Judaea with a large body of people who worshipped the Divinity. He declared and taught that the Egyptians and Africans entertained erroneous sentiments, in representing the Divinity under the likeness of wild beasts and cattle of the field; that the [[Greeks]] also were in error in making images of their gods after the human form. For God [said he] may be this one thing which encompasses us all, land and sea, which we call heaven, or the universe, or the nature of things....

36. By such doctrine Moses persuaded a large body of right-minded persons to accompany him to the place where [[Jerusalem]] now stands....<ref name=Strabo>Strabo. ''The Geography'', [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0239%3Abook%3D16%3Achapter%3D2%3Asection%3D35 16.2.35–36], Translated by H.C. Hamilton and W. Falconer in 1854, pp. 177–78,</ref>}}

In Strabo's writings of the history of [[Judaism]] as he understood it, he describes various stages in its development: from the first stage, including Moses and his direct heirs; to the final stage where "the [[Temple of Jerusalem]] continued to be surrounded by an aura of sanctity."  Strabo's "positive and unequivocal appreciation of Moses' personality is among the most sympathetic in all ancient literature."{{Sfn | Shmuel | 1976 | p = 1133}} His portrayal of Moses is said to be similar to the writing of [[Hecataeus of Abdera|Hecataeus]] who "described Moses as a man who excelled in wisdom and courage."{{Sfn | Shmuel | 1976 | p = 1133}}

Egyptologist [[Jan Assmann]] concludes that Strabo was the historian "who came closest to a construction of Moses' religion as [[monotheism|monotheistic]] and as a pronounced counter-religion." It recognized "only one divine being whom no image can represent... [and] the only way to approach this god is to live in virtue and in justice."{{Sfn | Assmann | 1997 | p = 38}}

===In Tacitus===
The Roman historian [[Tacitus]] (c. 56–120&nbsp;CE) refers to Moses by noting that the Jewish religion was monotheistic and without a clear image. His primary work, wherein he describes [[Jewish philosophy]], is his ''[[Histories (Tacitus)|Histories]]'' (c. 100), where, according to Arthur Murphy, as a result of the Jewish worship of one God, "[[paganism|pagan]] mythology fell into contempt."<ref>Tacitus, Cornelius. ''The works of Cornelius Tacitus: With an essay on his life and genius'' by Arthur Murphy, Thomas Wardle Publ. (1842) p. 499</ref> Tacitus states that, despite various opinions current in his day regarding the Jews' ethnicity, most of his sources are in agreement that there was an Exodus from Egypt. By his account, the Pharaoh [[Bakenranef|Bocchoris]], suffering from a [[Plague (disease)|plague]], banished the Jews in response to an oracle of the god [[Zeus]]-[[Amun]].
{{Quote | A motley crowd was thus collected and abandoned in the desert. While all the other outcasts lay idly lamenting, one of them, named '''Moses''', advised them not to look for help to gods or men, since both had deserted them, but to trust rather in themselves, and accept as divine the guidance of the first being, by whose aid they should get out of their present plight.<ref name=Tacitus />}}

In this version, Moses and the Jews wander through the desert for only six days, capturing the [[Holy Land]] on the seventh.<ref name=Tacitus>Tacitus, Cornelius. ''Tacitus, The Histories, Volume 2'', Book V. Chapters 5, 6 p. 208.</ref>

===In Longinus===
[[File:The Brazen Serpent.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|Moses lifts up the [[Nehushtan|brass serpent]], curing the Israelites from poisonous snake bites in a painting by [[Benjamin West]]]]
The [[Septuagint]], the Greek version of the Hebrew Bible, influenced [[Longinus (literature)|Longinus]], who may have been the author of the great book of literary criticism, ''[[On the Sublime]]''. The date of composition is unknown, but it is commonly assigned to the late Ist century C.E.<ref>Henry J. M. Day, [https://books.google.it/books?id=qIkgAwAAQBAJ&pg=PA12 ''Lucan and the Sublime: Power, Representation and Aesthetic Experience,''] Cambridge University Press, 2013 p. 12.</ref>

The writer quotes [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] in a "style which presents the nature of the deity in a manner suitable to his pure and great being," however he does not mention Moses by name, calling him 'no chance person' ({{lang|grc|οὐχ ὁ τυχὼν ἀνήρ}}) but "the Lawgiver" ({{lang|grc|θεσμοθέτης}}, [[Archon#Ancient Greece|thesmothete]]) of the Jews," a term that puts him on a par with [[Lycurgus of Sparta|Lycurgus]] and [[Minos]].<ref>Louis H. Felkdman, [https://books.google.it/books?id=Kbgf52KNsLQC&pg=PA239  ''Jew and Gentile in the Ancient World: Attitudes and Interactions from Alexander to Justinian,''] Princeton University Press 1996 p. 239.</ref>  Aside from a reference to [[Cicero]], Moses is the only non-Greek writer quoted in the work, contextually he is put on a par with [[Homer]],<ref name=Feldman>{{Citation | last = Feldman | first = Louis H | title = Josephus's Interpretation of the Bible | publisher = University of California Press | year = 1998 | p = 133}}.</ref> and he is described "with far more admiration than even Greek writers who treated Moses with respect, such as [[Hecataeus of Abdera|Hecataeus]] and [[Strabo]].{{Sfn | Shmuel | 1976 | p = 1140}}

===In Josephus===
In [[Josephus]]' (37 – c.&nbsp;100 CE) ''[[Antiquities of the Jews]]'',  Moses is mentioned throughout. For example Book VIII Ch. IV, describes [[Solomon's Temple]], also known as the First Temple, at the time the [[Ark of the Covenant]] was first moved into the newly built temple:
{{quote |When [[Solomon|King Solomon]] had finished these works, these large and beautiful buildings, and had laid up his donations in the temple, and all this in the interval of seven years, and had given a demonstration of his riches and alacrity therein; ...he also wrote to the rulers and elders of the Hebrews, and ordered all the people to gather themselves together to [[Jerusalem]], both to see the temple which he had built, and to remove the ark of God into it; and when this invitation of the whole body of the people to come to Jerusalem was everywhere carried abroad, ...The [[Sukkot|Feast of Tabernacles]] happened to fall at the same time, which was kept by the Hebrews as a most holy and most eminent feast. So they carried the ark and the tabernacle which Moses had pitched, and all the vessels that were for ministration to the sacrifices of God, and removed them to the temple. ...Now the ark contained nothing else but those two tables of stone that preserved the [[Ten Commandments|ten commandments]], which God spake to Moses in [[Mount Sinai]], and which were engraved upon them...<ref>{{Citation | last = Josephus | first = Flavius | title = The works: Comprising the Antiquities of the Jews | others = trans. by William Whiston | year = 1854 | volume = VIII | chapter = IV | pages = 254–55}}.</ref>}}

According to Feldman, Josephus also attaches particular significance to Moses' possession of the "cardinal virtues of wisdom, courage, temperance, and justice." He also includes piety as an added fifth virtue. In addition, he "stresses Moses' willingness to undergo toil and his careful avoidance of bribery. Like [[Plato]]'s [[Philosopher king|philosopher-king]], Moses excels as an educator."{{Sfn | Feldman | 1998 | p = 130}}

===In Numenius===
[[Numenius of Apamea|Numenius]], a Greek philosopher who was a native of [[Apamea, Syria|Apamea]], in Syria, wrote during the latter half of the 2nd century CE. Historian Kennieth Guthrie writes that "Numenius is perhaps the only recognized Greek philosopher who explicitly studied Moses, the prophets, and the life of [[Jesus]]..."{{Sfn | Guthrie | 1917 | p = 194}}  He describes his background:
{{quote |Numenius was a man of the world; he was not limited to [[Greco-Roman mysteries|Greek and Egyptian mysteries]], but talked familiarly of the myths of [[Brahmin]]s and [[Magi]].  It is however his knowledge and use of the Hebrew scriptures which distinguished him from other Greek philosophers. He refers to Moses simply as "the prophet", exactly as for him [[Homer]] is the poet. [[Plato]] is described as a Greek Moses.{{Sfn | Guthrie | 1917 | p = 101}}}}

===In Justin Martyr===
The Christian saint and religious philosopher [[Justin Martyr]] (103–165 CE) drew the same conclusion as [[Numenius of Apamea|Numenius]], according to other experts. Theologian Paul Blackham notes that Justin considered Moses to be "more trustworthy, profound and truthful because he is ''older'' than the [[Ancient Greek philosophy|Greek philosophers]]."{{Sfn | Blackham | 2005 | p = 39}}  He quotes him:
{{quote |I will begin, then, with our first prophet and lawgiver, Moses... that you may know that, of all your teachers, whether sages, poets, historians, philosophers, or lawgivers, by far the oldest, as the Greek histories show us, was Moses, who was our first religious teacher.{{Sfn | Blackham | 2005 | p = 39}}}}

Most of what is known about Moses from the Bible comes from the books of [[book of Exodus|Exodus]], [[Book of Leviticus|Leviticus]], [[book of Numbers|Numbers]] and [[Book of Deuteronomy|Deuteronomy]].{{sfn |Van Seters |2004|p=194}} The majority of scholars consider the compilation of these books to go back to the [[Yehud Medinata|Persian period]], 538–332&nbsp;BCE, but based on earlier written and oral traditions.<ref>Finkelstein, I., Silberman, NA., ''The Bible Unearthed: Archaeology's New Vision of Ancient Israel and the Origin of Its Sacred Texts'', p. 68</ref><ref>[[:fr:|Jean-Louis Ska]], [https://books.google.com./books?id=7g4yqsv0S0cC&pg=PA260''The Exegesis of the Pentateuch: Exegetical Studies and Basic Questions,''] Forschungen zum Alten Testament, Vol 66, Mohr Siebeck, 2009 p. 260.</ref> There is a wealth of stories and additional information about Moses in the [[Jewish apocrypha]] and in the genre of [[rabbi]]nical [[exegesis]] known as [[Midrash]], as well as in the primary works of the Jewish [[oral law]], the [[Mishnah]] and the [[Talmud]].  Moses is also given a number of bynames in Jewish tradition. The [[Midrash]] identifies Moses as one of seven biblical personalities who were called by various names.<ref>Midrash Rabbah, Ki Thissa, XL. 3-3, Lehrman, p. 463</ref> Moses' other names were: Jekuthiel (by his mother), Heber (by [[Amram|his father]]), Jered (by [[Miriam]]), Avi Zanoah (by Aaron), [[Avigdor (name)|Avi Gedor]] (by [[Kohath]]), Avi Soco (by his wet-nurse), Shemaiah ben Nethanel (by people of Israel).<ref>Yalkut Shimoni, Shemot 166 to Chronicles I 4:18, 24:6; also see Vayikra Rabbah 1:3; Chasidah p. 345</ref> Moses is also attributed the names Toviah (as a first name), and Levi (as a family name) (Vayikra Rabbah 1:3), Heman,<ref>Rashi to Bava Batra 15s, Chasidah p. 345</ref> Mechoqeiq (lawgiver)<ref>Bava Batra 15a on Deuteronomy 33:21, Chasidah p. 345</ref> and Ehl Gav Ish (Numbers 12:3).<ref>Rashi to Berachot 54a, Chasidah p. 345</ref> In another [[exegesis]], Moses had ascended to the first heaven until the [[Seven Heavens|seventh]], even visited [[Paradise]] and [[Hell]] alive, after he saw the [[burning bush|Divine vision]] in Mount Horeb.<ref>Ginzberg, Louis (1909).

Jewish historians who lived at [[Alexandria]], such as [[Eupolemus]], attributed to Moses the feat of having taught the [[Phoenicia]]ns [[Phoenician alphabet|their alphabet]],<ref>[[Eusebius]], ''[[Praeparatio evangelica]]'' ix. 26</ref> similar to legends of [[Thoth]]. [[Artapanus of Alexandria]] explicitly identified Moses not only with Thoth/[[Hermes]], but also with the Greek figure [[Musaeus of Athens|Musaeus]] (whom he called "the teacher of [[Orpheus]]"), and ascribed to him the division of Egypt into 36 districts, each with its own liturgy. He named the princess who adopted Moses as Merris, wife of Pharaoh Chenephres.<ref>Eusebius, l.c. ix. 27</ref>

Jewish tradition considers Moses to be the greatest prophet who ever lived.<ref>Ginzberg, Louis (1909).

To [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox Jews]], Moses is called ''Moshe Rabbenu, `Eved HaShem, Avi haNeviim zya"a'': "Our Leader Moshe, Servant of God, Father of all the Prophets (may his merit shield us, amen)".<ref>[[Honorifics for the dead in Judaism]].</ref> In the orthodox view, Moses received not only the Torah, but also the revealed (written and oral) and the hidden (the ''`hokhmat nistar'' teachings, which gave Judaism the [[Zohar]] of the [[Shimon bar Yochai|Rashbi]], the Torah of the [[Isaac Luria|Ari haQadosh]] and all that is discussed in the Heavenly Yeshiva between the [[Moshe Chaim Luzzatto|Ramhal]] and his masters).

Arising in part from his age of death (120 according to Deut. 34:7) and that "his eye had not dimmed, and his vigor had not diminished," the phrase "[[Live until 120|may you live to 120]]" has become a common blessing among Jews, especially since 120 is elsewhere stated as the maximum age for [[Noah]]'s descendants (one interpretation of {{Bibleverse|Genesis|6:3|HE}}).

===Christianity===
[[File:Transfigurationbloch.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.7|Moses appearing at the [[Transfiguration of Jesus]]]]
Moses is mentioned more often in the [[New Testament]] than any other [[Old Testament]] figure. For [[Christianity|Christians]], Moses is often a symbol of [[Divine law|God's law]], as reinforced and [[Expounding of the Law|expounded on]] in the teachings of [[Jesus]]. New Testament writers often compared Jesus' words and deeds with Moses' to explain Jesus' mission. In [[Acts of the Apostles|Acts]] 7:39–43, 51–53, for example, the rejection of Moses by the Jews who worshipped the [[golden calf]] is likened to the rejection of Jesus by the Jews that continued in traditional Judaism.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Acts (IVP New Testament Commentary Series)|last=Larkin|first=William J.|publisher=Intervarsity Press Academic|year=1995|isbn=978-0-8308-1805-1|location=|quote=|via=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts+7&version=NIV|title=Bible Gateway passage: Acts 7 – New International Version|website=Bible Gateway|access-date=2017-01-08}}</ref>

Moses also figures in several of Jesus' messages. When he met the [[Pharisees|Pharisee]] [[Nicodemus]] at night in the third chapter of the [[Gospel of John]], he compared Moses' lifting up of the [[Nehushtan|bronze serpent]] in the wilderness, which any Israelite could look at and be healed, to his own lifting up (by his death and [[resurrection]]) for the people to look at and be healed. In the sixth chapter, Jesus responded to the people's claim that Moses provided them ''[[manna]]'' in the wilderness by saying that it was not Moses, but God, who provided. Calling himself the "[[Bread of Life Discourse|bread of life]]", Jesus stated that He was provided to feed God's people. {{citation needed|reason=Secondary sources needed for this material|date=June 2016}}

Moses, along with [[Elijah]], is presented as meeting with Jesus in all three [[Synoptic Gospels]] of the [[Transfiguration of Jesus]] in [[Matthew 17]], [[Mark 9]], and [[Luke 9]], respectively. Jesus refers to the scribes and the Pharisees of the Temple as "seated in the chair of Moses" ({{lang-gr|επι της μωυσεως καθεδρας}}, ''epi tēs Mōuseōs kathedras'') <ref>{{bibleverse||Matthew|23:2|HCSB}}</ref>

His relevance to modern Christianity has not diminished. Moses is considered to be a [[saint]] by several churches; and is commemorated as a prophet in the respective [[Calendar of saints|Calendars of Saints]] of the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]], the [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic Church]], and the [[Lutheranism|Lutheran]] churches on September 4.

Latter-day Saints are also unique in believing that Moses was taken to heaven without having tasted death ([[Translation (LDS Church)|translated]]). In addition, [[Joseph Smith]] and [[Oliver Cowdery]] stated that on April 3, 1836, Moses appeared to them in the [[Kirtland Temple]] (located in [[Kirtland, Ohio]]) in a glorified, immortal, physical form and bestowed upon them the "keys of the gathering of Israel from the four parts of the earth, and the leading of the [[Ten Lost Tribes#Mormonism|ten tribes]] from the land of the north."<ref>The [[Doctrine and Covenants]] [http://scriptures.lds.org/en/dc/110/11#11 110:11]</ref>

Moses is mentioned more in the [[Quran]] than any other individual and his life is narrated and recounted more than that of any other [[Prophets of Islam|Islamic prophet]].{{Sfn | Keeler | 2005 | pp = 55–66}}  In general, Moses is described in ways which parallel the Islamic prophet [[Muhammad]],{{Sfn | Keeler | 2005 | pp = 55–56 | ps =, describes Moses from the Muslim perspective:
:"Among prophets, Moses has been described as the one 'whose career as a messenger of God, lawgiver and leader of his community most closely parallels and foreshadows that of Muhammad', and as 'the figure that in the Koran was presented to Muhammad above all others as the supreme model of saviour and ruler of a community, the man chosen to present both knowledge of the one God, and a divinely revealed system of law'.  We find him clearly in this role of Muhammad's forebear in a well-known tradition of the miraculous ascension of the Prophet, where Moses advises Muhammad from his own experience as messenger and lawgiver."}} and "his character exhibits some of the main themes of [[Schools of Islamic theology|Islamic theology]]," including the "moral injunction that we are to submit ourselves to God."{{citation needed|reason=What is the source for these quotes? |date=June 2016}}

Moses is defined in the Quran as both prophet (''nabi'') and messenger (''[[Prophets and messengers in Islam|rasul]]''), the latter term indicating that he was one of those prophets who brought a scripture and law to his people. {{citation needed|reason=Primary or secondary source needed for this material |date=June 2016}}

In the Moses story related by the Quran, Jochebed is commanded by God to place Moses in an ark and cast him on the waters of the Nile, thus abandoning him completely to God's protection.{{Sfn | Keeler | 2005 | pp = 55–66}}<ref>{{cite quran|28|7|style= ref}}</ref> The Pharaoh's wife [[Asiya]], not his daughter, found Moses floating in the waters of the Nile.

===Baha'i Faith===
Moses is one of the most important of God's messengers in the [[Bahá'í Faith]] being designated a [[Manifestation of God]].<ref>{{Citation | url = http://info.bahai.org/babi-and-bahai.html | title = Historical Context of the Bábi and Bahá'í Faiths | publisher = Bahá'i}}.</ref> An epithet of Moses in Baha'i scriptures is the One Who Conversed with God.<ref>{{Cite book|title = Epistle to the Son of the Wolf|last = Effendi|first = Shoghi|publisher = Baháí Publishing Trust|year = 1988|isbn = 978-0-87743-048-3|location = Wilmette, IL|page = 104}}</ref>

Important figures in the Baha’i religion, such as [[`Abdu'l-Bahá|Abdul’l-Baha]], have highlighted the fact that Moses, like [[Abraham]], had none of the makings of a [[Great Man theory|great man of history]], but through God's assistance he was able achieve many great things. He is described as having been "for a long time a shepherd in the wilderness," of having had a [[Stuttering|stammer]], and of being "much hated and detested" by the Pharaoh and the ancient Egyptians of his time. He is said to have been raised in an oppressive household, and to have been known, in Egypt, as a man who had committed murder – though he had done so in order to prevent an act of cruelty.<ref name="Clifford 1937 14–15">{{Cite book|title = Some Answered Questions|last = Clifford|first = Laura|publisher = Baha'i Publishing Trust|year = 1937|isbn = |location = New York|pages = 14–15}}</ref>

Nevertheless, like Abraham, through the assistance of God, he achieved great things and gained renown even beyond the [[Levant]]. Chief among these achievements was the freeing of his people, the Hebrews, from bondage in Egypt and leading "them to the Holy Land." He is viewed as the one who bestowed on Israel 'the religious and the civil law' which gave them "honour among all nations," and which spread their fame to different parts of the world.<ref name="Clifford 1937 14–15"/>

Furthermore, through the law, Moses is believed to have led the Hebrews 'to the highest possible degree of [[civilization]] at that period.’ Abdul’l-Baha asserts that the ancient Greek philosophers regarded "the illustrious men of Israel as models of perfection." Chief among these philosophers, he says, was [[Socrates]] who "visited Syria, and took from the children of Israel the teachings of the Unity of God and of the immortality of the soul."<ref name="Clifford 1937 14–15"/>

Moses is further described as paving the way for [[Bahá'u'lláh]] and his ultimate revelation, and as a teacher of truth, whose teachings were in line with the customs of his time.<ref>{{Citation | title = The Bahá'í: The Religious Construction of a Global Identity | page = 256 | first = Michael | last = McMullen | year = 2000}}.</ref>

==Legacy in politics and law==
{{globalize|date=May 2018}}
[[File:Moses LOC.jpg|thumb|Statue of Moses at the [[Library of Congress]]]]
In a metaphorical sense in the Christian tradition, a "Moses" has been referred to as the leader who delivers the people from a terrible situation. Among the [[List of Presidents of the United States|Presidents of the United States]] known to have used the symbolism of Moses were [[Harry S. Truman]], [[Jimmy Carter]], [[Ronald Reagan]], [[Bill Clinton]], [[George W. Bush]] and [[Barack Obama]], who referred to his supporters as "the Moses generation."<ref>{{Citation | last = Ifil | first = Gwen | title = The Breakthrough: Politics and Race in the Age of Obama | publisher = Random House | year = 2009 | page = 58}}.</ref>

In subsequent years, theologians linked the Ten Commandments with the formation of early [[democracy]].

===American history===

====Pilgrims====
[[File:Embarkation of the Pilgrims.jpg|thumb|left|Pilgrims [[John Carver (Mayflower passenger)|John Carver]], [[William Bradford (Plymouth Colony governor)|William Bradford]], and [[Miles Standish]], at prayer during their voyage to America. Painting by [[Robert Walter Weir]].]]
References to Moses were used by the [[Puritans]], who relied on the story of Moses to give meaning and hope to the lives of [[Pilgrim Fathers|Pilgrims]] seeking [[Freedom of religion|religious]] and [[Civil liberties|personal freedom]] in America. [[John Carver (Plymouth Colony governor)|John Carver]] was the first governor of [[Plymouth colony]] and first signer of the [[Mayflower Compact]], which he wrote in 1620 during the ship ''[[Mayflower]]'''s three-month voyage. He inspired the Pilgrims with a "sense of earthly grandeur and divine purpose," notes historian [[Jon Meacham]],{{Sfn | Meacham | 2006 | p = 40}} and was called the "Moses of the Pilgrims."<ref>{{Citation | last = Talbot | first = Archie Lee | title = A New Plymouth Colony at Kennebeck | place = Brunswick | year = 1930 | url = http://catalog.loc.gov/cgi-bin/Pwebrecon.cgi?DB=local&BBID=7810528&v3=1 | publisher = Library of Congress}}.</ref> Early American writer [[James Russell Lowell]] noted the similarity of the founding of America by the Pilgrims to that of [[History of ancient Israel and Judah|ancient Israel]] by Moses:
{{quote |Next to the fugitives whom Moses led out of Egypt, the little shipload of outcasts who landed at Plymouth are destined to influence the future of the world.<ref name= Lowell>{{Citation | last = Lowell | first = James Russell | title = The Round Table | publisher = Gorham Press | place = Boston | year = 1913 | pages = 217–18 | quote = Next to the fugitives whom Moses led out of Egypt, the little shipload of outcasts who landed at Plymouth are destined to influence the future of the world.  The spiritual thirst of mankind has for ages been quenched at Hebrew fountains; but the embodiment in human institutions of truths uttered by the [[Son of man|Son of Man]] eighteen centuries ago was to be mainly the work of Puritan thought and Puritan self-devotion. …If their municipal regulations smack somewhat of Judaism, yet there can be no nobler aim or more practical wisdom than theirs; for it was to make the law of man a living counterpart of the law of God, in their highest conception of it.}}</ref>}}

Following Carver's death the following year, [[William Bradford (Plymouth Colony governor)|William Bradford]] was made governor. He feared that the remaining Pilgrims would not survive the hardships of the new land, with half their people having already died within months of arriving. Bradford evoked the symbol of Moses to the weakened and desperate Pilgrims to help calm them and give them hope: "Violence will break all. Where is the meek and humble spirit of Moses?"<ref>{{Citation | last = Arber | first = Edward | title = The Story of the Pilgrim Fathers | publisher = Houghton, Mifflin & Co. | year = 1897 | page = 345}}.</ref> [[William G.

====Founding Fathers of the United States====
[[File:FirstCommitteeGreatSealReverseLossingDrawing.jpg|thumb|First proposed seal of the United States, 1776]]

On July 4, 1776, immediately after the [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]] was officially passed, the [[Continental Congress]] asked [[John Adams]], [[Thomas Jefferson]], and [[Benjamin Franklin]] to design a seal that would clearly represent a symbol for the new United States.  They chose the symbol of Moses leading the Israelites to freedom.{{Sfn | Feiler | 2009 | p = 35}}  The [[Founding Fathers of the United States]] inscribed the words of Moses on the [[Liberty Bell]]: "Proclaim Liberty thro' all the Land to all the Inhabitants thereof." ([[Leviticus]] 25)

Upon the death of [[George Washington]] in 1799, two thirds of his eulogies referred to him as "America's Moses," with one orator saying that "Washington has been the same to us as Moses was to the Children of Israel."{{Sfn | Feiler | 2009 | p = 102}}

[[Benjamin Franklin]], in 1788, saw the difficulties that some of the newly independent [[U.S. state|American states]] were having in forming a government, and proposed that until a new code of laws could be agreed to, they should be governed by "the laws of Moses," as contained in the Old Testament.<ref name=Franklin>{{Citation | last = Franklin | first = Benjamin | editor-last = Franklin | editor-first = William Temple | title = Memoirs | volume = 2 | publisher = McCarty & Davis | place = Philadelphia | format = ebook | year = 1834 | page = 504}}.</ref>  He justified his proposal by explaining that the laws had worked in biblical times: "The [[Supreme Being]]… having rescued them from bondage by many miracles, performed by his servant Moses, he personally delivered to that chosen servant, in the presence of the whole nation, a constitution and code of laws for their observance.{{Sfn | Franklin | 1834 | p = 211}}

[[John Adams]], 2nd [[List of Presidents of the United States|President of the United States]], stated why he relied on the laws of Moses over [[Ancient Greek philosophy|Greek philosophy]] for establishing the [[United States Constitution]]: "As much as I love, esteem, and admire the Greeks, I believe the Hebrews have done more to enlighten and civilize the world. Moses did more than all their legislators and philosophers.{{Sfn | Meacham | 2006 | p = 40}}  Swedish historian [[Hugo Valentin]] credited Moses as the "first to proclaim the [[Human rights|rights of man]]."<ref name= Shuldiner>{{Citation | last = Shuldiner | first = David Philip | title = Of Moses and Marx | publisher = Greenwood | year = 1999 | page = 35}}.</ref>

====Slavery and civil rights====

Historian Gladys L. Knight describes how leaders who emerged during and after the period in which [[slavery in the United States]] was legal often personified the Moses symbol. "The symbol of Moses was empowering in that it served to amplify a need for freedom."<ref>Knight, Gladys L. ''Icons of African American Protest'' Vol I, Greenwood (2009) p. 183</ref> Therefore, when [[Abraham Lincoln]] was [[Assassination of Abraham Lincoln|assassinated in 1865]] after the passage of the [[Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|amendment to the Constitution outlawing slavery]], [[African Americans|Black Americans]] said they had lost "their Moses".<ref>{{cite book| first =Martha | last = Hodes|title=Mourning Lincoln|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=59ZtBgAAQBAJ&pg=PA164 |year=2015 |publisher=Yale University Press|pages=164, 237| isbn = 978-0-300-21356-0}}</ref> Lincoln biographer [[Charles Carleton Coffin]] writes, "The millions whom Abraham Lincoln delivered from slavery will ever liken him to Moses, the deliverer of Israel."<ref>{{Citation | last = Coffin | first = Charles Carleton | title = Abraham Lincoln | publisher = Ulan Press | type = reprint | origyear = 1893 | year = 2012 | page = 534}}.</ref> Similarly, [[Harriet Tubman]], who rescued approximately seventy enslaved family and friends, was also described as the "Moses" of her people.<ref>{{Citation | first1 = Joyce Stokes | last1 = Jones | first2 = Michele Jones | last2 = Galvin | title = Beyond the Underground.

In the 1960s, a leading figure in the [[civil rights movement]] was [[Martin Luther King Jr.]], who was called "a modern Moses," and often referred to Moses in his speeches: "The struggle of Moses, the struggle of his devoted followers as they sought to get out of Egypt.

===Criticism of Moses===
[[File:Tissot The Women of Midian Led Captive by the Hebrews.jpg|thumb|The Women of Midian Led Captive by the Hebrews [[James Tissot]] c.1900]]
'''Thomas Paine and Numbers 31:13–18'''<br>
In the late eighteenth century, the deist [[Thomas Paine]] commented at length on Moses' Laws in ''[[The Age of Reason]]'' (1794, 1795, and 1807). Paine considered Moses to be a "detestable [[villain]]", and cited {{bibleverse ||Numbers|31:13–18|NKJV}} as an example of his "unexampled atrocities".<ref>Paine, Thomas (1796) ''[[The Age of Reason]], part II''.</ref> In the passage, the Jewish army had returned from [[Midian war|conquering the Midianites]], and Moses has gone down to meet it:

{{bquote | And Moses, and [[Eleazar]] the priest, and all the princes of the congregation, went forth to meet them without the camp; and Moses was wroth with the officers of the host, with the captains over thousands, and captains over hundreds, which came from the battle; and Moses said unto them, Have ye saved all the women alive? behold, these caused the children of Israel, through the counsel of [[Balaam]], to commit trespass against the Lord in the matter of [[Peor]], and there was a plague among the congregation of the Lord. Now, therefore, kill every male among the little ones, and kill every woman that hath known a man by lying with him; but all the women-children, that [[Virginity|have not known a man by lying with him]], keep alive for yourselves.<ref>{{bibleverse ||Numbers|31:13–18|KJV}}</ref>}}

The prominent atheist [[Richard Dawkins]] also made reference to these verses in his 2006 book, ''[[The God Delusion]]'', concluding that Moses was "not a great [[role model]] for modern moralists".<ref>Dawkins, Richard (2006). ''The God Delusion'' Chapter 7. Bantam Press. {{ISBN|0-593-05548-9}}</ref>

Rabbi Joel Grossman argued that the story is a "powerful [[fable]] of [[lust]] and [[betrayal]]", and that Moses' execution of the women was a symbolic condemnation of those who seek to turn sex and desire to evil purposes.<ref>Grossman, Joel (2008), [http://libraryminyan.org/divreitorah/Jole%20Grossman%20-%20Matot.htm "Matot"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304101001/http://libraryminyan.org/divreitorah/Jole%20Grossman%20-%20Matot.htm |date=2016-03-04 }}. Temple Beth Am Library Minyan.</ref> Alan Levin, an educational specialist with the [[Reform Judaism|Reform]] movement, has similarly suggested that the story should be taken as a [[cautionary tale]], to "warn successive generations of Jews to watch their own idolatrous behavior".<ref>Levin, Alan J. [http://www.myjewishlearning.com/texts/Bible/Weekly_Torah_Portion/mattot_uahc.shtml "Some messages are hard to deliver"]. My Jewish Learning.</ref>

However, some Jewish sources defend Moses' role. The [[Moses Sofer|Chasam Sofer]] emphasizes that this war was not fought at Moses' behest, but was commanded by God as an act of revenge against the Midianite women,<ref>{{Citation | url = http://www.ou.org/torah/tt/5763/matmas63/aliya.htm | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20030802230201/http://www.ou.org/torah/tt/5763/matmas63/aliya.htm | dead-url = yes | archive-date = 2003-08-02 | title = Aliya-by-Aliya Sedra Summary | series = Torah Tidbits | publisher = OU }}.</ref> who, according to the Biblical account, had seduced the Israelites and led them to sin. In ''[[Legend of the Jews]]'', [[Phinehas]] son of [[Eleazar]] defend their innocent action in leaving the women remain alive because Moses instructed them to take revenge "only to the Midianites," without mentioning "Midianite women."<ref>Ginzberg, Louis (1909). ''[http://www.swartzentrover.com/cotor/e-books/misc/Legends/Legends%20of%20the%20Jews.pdf The Legends of the Jews Vol. III : The Victorious Return from the War]'' (Translated by Henrietta Szold) Philadelphia: Jewish Publication Society.</ref> As God had also commanded them to be a holy nation,<ref>{{bibleverse ||Leviticus|20:26|KJV}}</ref> the "polluted" or unvirgin women should not be preferred among sons of Israel, therefore the "pure" or virgin women are more sacred for themselves.<ref>{{bibleverse ||Deuteronomy|22:20–21|KJV}}</ref>
