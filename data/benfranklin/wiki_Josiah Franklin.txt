'''Josiah Franklin Sr.''' (December 23, 1657 – January 16, 1745) was an [[English people|English]] businessman and the father of [[Benjamin Franklin]]. Born in the village of [[Ecton, Northamptonshire|Ecton]], [[Northamptonshire]], [[England]], Josiah was the ninth child of blacksmith Thomas Franklin (b. 1598), and his first wife, Jane White.

Upon moving to [[Boston]], he took up the trade of [[tallow]] [[Chandlery|chandler]] and soap boiler because the trade he was born to was not in demand in [[New England]].

Abiah bore Josiah 10 children: John (1690), Peter (1692), Mary (1694), [[James Franklin (printer)|James]] (1697), Sarah (1699), Ebenezer (1701), Thomas (1703), [[Benjamin Franklin|Benjamin]] (1706), Lydia (1708), and [[Jane Mecom|Jane]] (1712).

==Benjamin Franklin==
Josiah insisted that each of his sons must learn a trade. He had great dreams of Benjamin becoming a minister,<ref>[http://www.ushistory.org/franklin/info/index.htm Franklin], US History</ref> but Josiah could only afford to send his son to school for two years. As his young Benjamin loved to read, Josiah apprenticed him to his brother James, who was a printer. Later, Benjamin Franklin borrowed books from his friends and taught himself [[arithmetic]], [[grammar]], and [[philosophy]]. Benjamin, whose full name was Benjamin Josiah Franklin,<ref>[http://www.ushistory.org/franklin/info/index.htm Franklin], US History</ref> had a very strong relationship with his father, who had a great influence on Benjamin.<ref>[http://www.ushistory.org/franklin/info/index.htm Franklin], US History</ref>
