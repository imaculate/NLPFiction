'''Newport''' is a seaside city on [[Aquidneck Island]]<ref>Aquidneck Island was called Rhode Island during Colonial times, and is still shown on some nautical charts as Rhode Island.</ref> in [[Newport County, Rhode Island]], located approximately {{convert|33|mi|km}} southeast of [[Providence, Rhode Island]], {{convert|20|mi|km}} south of [[Fall River, Massachusetts]], {{convert|73|mi|km}} south of Boston, and {{convert|180|mi|km}} northeast of New York City. It is known as a New England summer resort and is famous for its historic [[Newport Mansions|mansions]] and its rich sailing history. It is also the home of [[Salve Regina University]] and [[Naval Station Newport]], which houses the United States [[Naval War College]], the [[Naval Undersea Warfare Center]], and an important Navy training center. It was a major 18th-century port city and also contains a high number of buildings from the [[Colonial history of the United States|Colonial]] era.<ref>James D. Kornwolf, Georgiana Wallis Kornwolf, Architecture and town planning in colonial North America, Volume 1 (JHU Press, 2002), pg. 1021 https://books.google.com/books?id=DA9_v6Ma1a8C&source=gbs_navlinks_s</ref>

The city is the county seat of Newport County, which has no governmental functions other than court administrative and sheriff corrections boundaries. A playground for the wealthy in the 19th and early 20th centuries, it was the location of the first U.S. Open tournaments in both [[US Open (tennis)|tennis]] and [[US Open (golf)|golf]], as well as every challenge to the [[America's Cup]] between 1930 and 1983.  It was known for being the location of the "[[Summer White Houses]]" during the administrations of Presidents [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] and [[John F. Kennedy]]. The population was 24,027 as of 2013.

==History==
{{see also|Timeline of Newport, Rhode Island}}

===Colonial period===

[[File:Newport, R.I. in 1730 (NYPL Hades-254162-478731).jpg|thumb|right|''Newport, R.I. in 1730'', [https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Newport,_R.I._in_1730_(NYPL_Hades-254162-478731).jpg New York Public Library]]]
Newport was founded in 1639 on [[Aquidneck Island]], which was called Rhode Island at the time. Its eight founders and first officers were [[Nicholas Easton]], [[William Coddington]], [[John Clarke (Baptist minister)|John Clarke]], [[John Coggeshall]], [[William Brenton]], [[Jeremy Clarke (Governor)|Jeremy Clark]], [[Thomas Hazard]], and [[Henry Bull (Governor)|Henry Bull]]. Many of these people had been part of the settlement at [[Portsmouth, Rhode Island|Portsmouth]], along with [[Anne Hutchinson]] and her followers. They separated within a year of that settlement, however, and Coddington and others began the settlement of Newport on the southern side of the island.

Newport grew to be the largest of the four original settlements which became the [[Colony of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations]], which also included [[Providence Plantations]] and [[Warwick, Rhode Island|Shawomett]]. Many of the first colonists in Newport became [[Baptists]], and the second Baptist congregation in Rhode Island was formed in 1640 under the leadership of John Clarke.  In 1658, a group of Jews were welcomed to settle in Newport; they were fleeing the [[Inquisition]] in Spain and Portugal but had not been permitted to settle elsewhere. The Newport congregation is now referred to as Congregation Jeshuat Israel and is the second-oldest Jewish congregation in the United States. It meets in [[Touro Synagogue]], the oldest synagogue in the United States.

The Colony of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations received its royal charter in 1663, and [[Benedict Arnold (governor)|Benedict Arnold]] was elected as its first governor at Newport. The [[Old Colony House]] served as a seat of Rhode Island's government upon its completion in 1741 at the head of [[Washington Square (Newport, Rhode Island)|Washington Square]], until the current [[Rhode Island State House]] in Providence was completed in 1904 and Providence became the state's sole capital city. Newport became the most important port in colonial Rhode Island, and a public school was established in 1640.

The commercial activity which raised Newport to its fame as a rich port was begun by a second wave of Portuguese Jews who settled there around the middle of the 18th century. They had been practicing Judaism in secret for 300 years in Portugal, and they were attracted to Rhode Island because of the freedom of worship there. They brought with them commercial experience and connections, capital, and a spirit of enterprise. Most prominent among those were Jacob Rodrigues Rivera, who arrived in 1745 (died 1789) and [[Aaron Lopez]], who came in 1752 (died May 28, 1782). Rivera introduced the manufacture of [[sperm oil]] which became one of Newport's leading industries and made the town rich. Newport developed 17 manufactories of oil and candles and enjoyed a practical monopoly of this trade until the [[American Revolution]].

Aaron Lopez is credited with making Newport an important center of trade.<ref>''Settlement of the Jews in North America''. Charles P. Daly, Ll.D., President of the American Geographical Society; P. Cowen, 1893, Digitized Mar 17, 2008></ref> He encouraged 40 Portuguese Jewish families to settle there, and Newport had 150 vessels engaged in trade within 14 years of his activity.<ref>Wiernik, Peter. ''History of the Jews in America: From the Period of the Discovery of the New World to the Present Time''. The Jewish Press Publishing Company, 1912, p. 73.</ref> He was involved in the slave trade and manufactured spermaceti candles, ships, barrels, rum, chocolate, textiles, clothes, shoes, hats, and bottles.<ref>Kaplan, Marilyn (2004), "The Jewish Merchants of Newport, 1749–1790", in George M. Goodwin and Ellen Smith (eds.), ''The Jews of Rhode Island'', Waltham, MA: Brandeis University Press {{ISBN|1-58465-424-4}}</ref>  He became the wealthiest man in Newport but was denied citizenship on religious grounds, even though British law protected the rights of Jews to become citizens.<ref>Feldberg, Michael (ed.) (2002). "Aaron Lopez's Struggle for Citizenship". ''Blessings of Freedom: Chapters in American Jewish History.'' New York: American Jewish Historical Society. {{ISBN|0-88125-756-7}}.</ref> He appealed to the Rhode Island legislature for redress and was refused with this ruling: "Inasmuch as the said Aaron Lopez hath declared himself by religion a Jew, this Assembly doth not admit himself nor any other of that religion to the full freedom of this Colony. So that the said Aaron Lopez nor any other of said religion is not liable to be chosen into any office in this colony nor allowed to give vote as a free man in choosing others."<ref>[http://www.ajhs.org/scholarship/chapters/chapter.cfm?documentID=187 ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120301010522/http://www.ajhs.org/scholarship/chapters/chapter.cfm?documentID=187 |date=March 1, 2012 }}</ref> Lopez persisted by applying for citizenship in Massachusetts, where it was granted.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?letter=N&artid=257 |title=Newport |publisher=JewishEncyclopedia.com |accessdate=2013-06-04}}</ref>

From the mid-17th century, the religious tolerance in Newport attracted numbers of [[Quakers]], known also as the ''Society of Friends''.<ref>{{cite web|title=Great Friends Meeting House|url=http://newporthistory.org/properties/great-friends-meeting-house/|website=www.newporthistory.org|accessdate=11 May 2017}}</ref> The [[Great Friends Meeting House]] in Newport (1699) is the oldest existing structure of worship in Rhode Island.

In 1727, [[James Franklin (printer)|James Franklin]] (brother of [[Benjamin Franklin|Benjamin]]) printed the ''Rhode-Island Almanack'' in Newport. In 1732, he published the first newspaper, the ''Rhode Island Gazette''. In 1758, his son James founded the weekly newspaper ''Mercury''. The famous 18th century [[Goddard and Townsend]] furniture was also made in Newport.

Throughout the 18th century, Newport suffered from an imbalance of trade with the largest colonial ports.  As a result, Newport merchants were forced to develop alternatives to conventional exports.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Tunnell |first=Daniel L. |author2=Hechtlinger, Adelaide |title=Life in Newport Part II: The Eighteenth Century |journal=Early American Life |pages=26–31 |date=April 1975}}</ref> In the 1720s, Colonial leaders arrested many pirates, acting under pressure from the British government. Many were hanged in Newport and were buried on [[Goat Island, Rhode Island|Goat Island]].

===Slave trade===
Newport was a major center of the [[slave trade]] in colonial and early America, active in the [[Atlantic slave trade#Triangular trade|"triangle trade"]] in which slave-produced sugar and molasses from the Caribbean were carried to Rhode Island and distilled into [[rum]], which was then carried to West Africa and exchanged for captives. In 1764, Rhode Island had about 30 rum distilleries, 22 in Newport alone. The [[Common Burial Ground]] on Farewell Street was where most of the slaves were buried.

Sixty percent of slave-trading voyages launched from North America issued from tiny Rhode Island, in some years more than 90%, and many from Newport. Almost half were trafficked illegally, breaking a 1787 state law prohibiting residents of the state from trading in slaves. Slave traders were also breaking federal statutes of 1794 and 1800 barring Americans from carrying slaves to ports outside the United States, as well as the [[Act Prohibiting Importation of Slaves|1807 Congressional act]] abolishing the transatlantic slave trade. A few Rhode Island families made substantial fortunes in the trade. [[William Vernon|William]] and Samuel Vernon were Newport merchants who later played an important role in financing the creation of the United States Navy; they sponsored 30 African slaving ventures. However, it was the DeWolfs of [[Bristol, Rhode Island]], and most notably [[James De Wolf]], who were the largest slave-trading family in all of North America, mounting more than 80 transatlantic voyages, most of them illegal. The Rhode Island slave trade was broadly based. Seven hundred Rhode Islanders owned or captained slave ships, including most substantial merchants, and many ordinary shopkeepers and tradesmen who purchased shares in slaving voyages.<ref>https://www.brown.edu/Research/Slavery_Justice/documents/SlaveryAndJustice.pdf</ref>

In addition to being one of America's most active slave ports, Newport was also home to a small community of abolitionists and free blacks. Reverend [[Samuel Hopkins (theologian)|Samuel Hopkins]], minister at Newport's [[United Congregational Church (Newport, Rhode Island)|First Congregational Church]], has been called "America's first abolitionist."<ref name="ProJo20171219">{{cite news|last1=Stokes|first1=Keith|title=R.I.’s former slaves achieved great things|url=http://www.providencejournal.com/opinion/20171219/my-turn-keith-stokes-ris-former-slaves-achieved-great-things|accessdate=20 December 2017|publisher=The Providence Journal|date=19 December 2017}}</ref> Among subscribers to Hopkins' writings were 17 free black subscribers, most of whom lived in Newport.<ref name="ProJo20171219" /> This community of free blacks, including [[Newport Gardner]], founded the [[Free African Union Society]] in 1780, the first African [[Benefit society|mutual aid society]] in America.<ref name="1696Heritage">{{cite web|last1=Stokes|first1=Keith|title=The Black Origins of the Back to Africa Movement|url=http://www.1696heritage.com/the-black-origins-of-the-back-to-africa-movement/|website=1696 Heritage Group|publisher=1696 Heritage Group|accessdate=20 December 2017}}</ref>

===American Revolutionary era===
[[Image:W-RSimpleMap.gif|thumb|250px|NPS map of the [[Washington-Rochambeau Revolutionary Route|W3R Route]]]]
Newport was the scene of much activity during the [[American Revolution]]. [[William Ellery]] came from Newport, one of the signers of the [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]]. He later served on the Naval Committee.

In the winter of 1775 and 1776, the [[Rhode Island Legislature]] put militia General [[William West (Rhode Island politician)|William West]] in charge of rooting out [[Loyalist (American Revolution)|loyalists]] in Newport, and several notable individuals were exiled to the northern part of the state, such as [[Joseph Wanton]] and Thomas Vernon.<ref>{{cite book |title= The Diary of Thomas Vernon |url= https://books.google.com/?id=clqxUiI0fKoC&pg=RA2-PA1&lpg=RA2-PA1&dq=%22thomas+vernon%22 |publisher= S.S. Rider |author1= Vernon, Thomas |author2= Rider, Sidney Smith |author3= Ellery, Harrison |author4= Greene, George Sears |year= 1879 }}</ref> In the fall of 1776, the British saw that Newport could be used as a naval base to attack New York (which they had recently occupied), so they took over the city.  The population of Newport had divided loyalties; many pro–independence Patriots left town, while loyalist Tories remained.  Newport was a British stronghold for the next three years.

In the summer of 1778, the Americans began the campaign known as the [[Battle of Rhode Island]]. This was the first joint operation between the Americans and the French after the signing of the [[Treaty of Alliance (1778)|Treaty of Alliance]]. The Americans based in [[Tiverton, Rhode Island|Tiverton]] planned a formal [[siege]] of the town. However, the French refused to take part in it, wanting a frontal assault.  This weakened the American position, and the British were able to expel the Americans from the island. The following year, the British abandoned Newport, wanting to concentrate their forces in New York.

On July 10, 1780, [[Expédition Particulière|a French expedition]] arrived in [[Narragansett Bay]] off Newport with an army of 450 officers and 5,300 men, sent by [[King Louis XVI]] and commanded by [[Jean-Baptiste Donatien de Vimeur, comte de Rochambeau|Rochambeau]].  For the rest of the war, Newport was the base of the French forces in the United States.  In July 1781, Rochambeau was finally able to leave Newport for [[Providence, Rhode Island|Providence]] to begin the [[Washington–Rochambeau Revolutionary Route|decisive march]] to [[Yorktown, Virginia]], along with General [[George Washington]]. The first Roman [[Catholic mass]] in Rhode Island was said in Newport during this time. The [[Rochambeau Monument (Newport, RI)|Rochambeau Monument]] in Kings Park on Wellington Avenue along Newport Harbor commemorates Rochambeau's contributions to the Revolutionary War and to Newport's history.

Newport's population had fallen from over 9,000 (according to the census of 1774) to fewer than 4,000 by the time that the war ended (1783). Over 200 abandoned buildings were torn down in the 1780s. Also, the war destroyed Newport's economic wealth, as years of military occupation closed the city to any form of trade. The Newport merchants moved away, some to Providence, others to [[Boston]] and New York.

It was in Newport that the [[Rhode Island General Assembly]] voted to ratify the [[United States Constitution|Constitution]] in 1791 and become the 13th state, acting under pressure from the merchant community of Providence.

The city was the last residence of Commodore [[Oliver Hazard Perry]] and the birthplace of Commodore [[Matthew C. Perry]] and the Reverend [[William Ellery Channing]].

===Gilded Age===
Beginning in the mid-nineteenth century, wealthy southern planters seeking to escape the heat began to build summer cottages on Bellevue Avenue, such as [[Kingscote (mansion)|Kingscote]] (1839).<ref>{{cite web |url= http://tickets.newportmansions.org/mansion.aspx?id=1009 |title= Kingscote |publisher= The Preservation Society of Newport County }}</ref>  Around the middle of the century, wealthy [[Yankee]]s, such as the Wetmore family, also began constructing larger mansions, such as [[Chateau-sur-Mer]] (1852) nearby.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://tickets.newportmansions.org/mansion.aspx?id=1005 |title= Chateau-sur-Mer |publisher= The Preservation Society of Newport County }}</ref> Most of these early families made a substantial part of their fortunes in the [[Old China Trade]].<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1G1-16998520.html |title= Newport and the Far East. (Newport, Rhode Island) |publisher= The Magazine Antiques |date=1995-04-01 |author= Michie, Thomas }}</ref>

By the turn of the 20th century, many of the nation's wealthiest families were summering in Newport, including the [[Vanderbilt family|Vanderbilts]], [[Astor family|Astors]], and the [[Widener family]], who constructed the largest "cottages", such as [[The Breakers]] (1895) and [[Miramar (mansion)|Miramar]].<ref>{{cite web |url= http://tickets.newportmansions.org/mansion.aspx?id=1000 |title= The Breakers |publisher= The Preservation Society of Newport County }}</ref>  They resided for a brief summer social season in grand, gilded mansions with elaborate receiving rooms, dining rooms, music rooms, and ballrooms—but with few bedrooms, since the guests were expected to have "cottages" of their own. Many of the homes were designed by New York architect [[Richard Morris Hunt]], who kept a house in Newport himself.

The social scene at Newport is described in [[Edith Wharton]]'s novel ''[[The Age of Innocence]]''. Wharton's own Newport "cottage" was called ''Land's End.'' Today, many mansions continue in private use. [[Hammersmith Farm]] is the mansion where [[John F. Kennedy]] and [[Jackie Kennedy]] held their wedding reception; it was open to tourists as a "house museum", but has since been purchased and reconverted into a private residence. Many other mansions are open to tourists; still others were converted into academic buildings for [[Salve Regina College]] in the 1930s, when the owners could no longer afford their tax bills.

In the mid-19th century, a large number of [[Irish immigrants]] settled in Newport. The Fifth Ward of Newport in the southern part of the city became a staunch Irish neighborhood for many generations. To this day, St. Patrick's Day is an important day of pride and celebration in Newport, with a large parade going down Thames Street.

The oldest Catholic parish in Rhode Island is [[St. Mary's Church Complex (Newport, Rhode Island)|St. Mary's]], located on Spring Street—though the current building is not the original one.

===20th century and beyond===
Rhode Island did not have a fixed capital during and after the colonial era but rotated its legislative sessions among Providence, Newport, Bristol, East Greenwich, and South Kingstown. In 1854, the sessions were eliminated in the cities other than Providence and Newport, and Newport was finally dropped in 1900. A constitutional amendment that year restricted the meetings of the legislature to Providence.<ref>Taylor, William Harrison. Legislative History and Souvenir of Rhode Island, 1899–1900. pg 211</ref>

[[John Fitzgerald Kennedy]] and [[Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis|Jacqueline Bouvier]] were married in St. Mary's Church in Newport on September 12, 1953.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Catherine|first1=Martha|last2=Anderson|first2=Cosgrove|title=John F. Kennedy|date=2005|publisher=Learner Publishing Group|isbn=9780822526438|pages=43–44}}</ref> Presidents [[John F. Kennedy|Kennedy]] and [[Dwight Eisenhower|Eisenhower]] both made Newport the sites of their "[[Summer White Houses]]" during their years in office. Eisenhower stayed at Quarters A at the [[Naval War College]] and at what became known as the [[Eisenhower House]],<ref>{{cite web|title=The Eisenhower House|url=http://www.eisenhowerhouse.com/|accessdate=1 September 2012}}</ref> while Kennedy used [[Hammersmith Farm]] next door.

[[Image:NavalWarCollege.jpg|thumb|260px|[[Naval War College]]]]
The city has long been entwined with the [[United States Navy]]. It held the campus of the [[U.S. Naval Academy]] during the [[American Civil War]] (1861–65) when the undergraduate officer training school was temporarily moved north from [[Annapolis, Maryland]]. From 1952 to 1973, it hosted the Cruiser-Destroyer Force of the [[United States Fleet Forces Command|U.S. Atlantic Fleet]], and subsequently it has hosted smaller numbers of warships from time to time. Today it hosts the [[Naval Station Newport]] (NAVSTA Newport) and remains home to the U.S. [[Naval War College]] and the [[Naval Education and Training Command]] (NETC), the center for [[Surface Warfare Officer]] training, numerous other schools, and the headquarters of the [[Naval Undersea Warfare Center]]. The [[Ship decommissioning|decommissioned]] aircraft carrier {{USS|Saratoga|CV-60}} was moored in an inactive status at the docks previously used by the Cruiser-Destroyer Force, until it was towed to Brownsville, Texas in August–September 2014 to be dismantled. The {{USS|Forrestal|CV-59}} shared the pier until June 2010.{{citation needed|date = September 2014}}

The departure of the Cruiser-Destroyer fleet from Newport and the closure of nearby [[Naval Air Station Quonset Point]] in 1973 were devastating to the local economy. The population of Newport decreased, businesses closed, and property values plummeted. However, in the late 1960s, the city began revitalizing the downtown area with the construction of America's Cup Avenue, malls of stores and condominiums, and upscale hotels. Construction was completed on the [[Claiborne Pell Newport Bridge|Newport Bridge]]. The [[Preservation Society of Newport County]] began opening Newport's historic mansions to the public, and the tourist industry became Newport's primary commercial enterprise over the subsequent years.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.rilin.state.ri.us/studteaguide/rhodeislandhistory/chapt8.html |title= Rhode Island History |publisher= Rhode Island General Assembly |access-date= 2008-05-10 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20070829045227/http://www.rilin.state.ri.us/studteaguide/RhodeIslandHistory/chapt8.html |archive-date= 2007-08-29 |dead-url= yes |df=  }}</ref>
