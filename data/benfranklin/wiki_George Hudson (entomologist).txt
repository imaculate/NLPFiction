==Biography==
Born in [[London]], England, on [[Easter Saturday]], 1867 Hudson was the sixth child of Emily Jane Carnal and Charles Hudson, an artist and stained-glass window designer.  By the age of 14 he had built up a collection of British insects, and had published a paper in ''The Entomologist''. In 1881 Hudson moved with his father to [[Nelson, New Zealand|Nelson]], New Zealand. He worked on a farm, and in 1883, aged 16, he began working at the post office in [[Wellington]], where he eventually became chief clerk, retiring in 1918.<ref>{{vcite journal |author=J.T.

Hudson was a member of the [[1907 Sub-Antarctic Islands Scientific Expedition]]. The main aim of the expedition was to extend the magnetic survey of New Zealand by investigating the [[Auckland Islands|Auckland]] and [[Campbell Island group|Campbell islands]] but botanical, biological and zoological surveys were also conducted. The voyage also resulted in rescue of the castaways of the shipwreck the ''[[Dundonald (ship)|Dundonald]]'' in the Auckland Islands.

Hudson is credited with proposing modern-day [[daylight saving time]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/03/09/daylight-savings-time-history-george-vernon-hudson_n_1333378.html|title=The Man Who Invented Daylight Savings Time|last=Satran|first=Joe|date=2012-03-09|website=The Huffington Post|publisher=AOL Inc.|access-date=2017-01-17}}</ref> His [[shift work|shift-work]] job gave him leisure time to collect insects, and led him to value after-hours daylight.<ref name="DNZB Hudson">{{DNZB|Gibbs|George|3H42|Hudson, George Vernon|11 March 2012}}</ref> In 1895, he presented a paper to the Wellington Philosophical Society proposing a two-hour daylight-saving shift,<ref>{{vcite journal |author=G.

K. Sidey Medal]], set up by the [[Royal Society of New Zealand]] from funds collected to commemorate the passing of the Summer-Time Act 1927.<ref>{{cite web |title=Background of the Medal |url=http://www.royalsociety.org.nz/programmes/awards/sidey-medal/background/ |publisher=[[Royal Society of New Zealand]] |accessdate=7 August 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Recipients |url=http://www.royalsociety.org.nz/programmes/awards/sidey-medal/recipients/ |publisher=[[Royal Society of New Zealand]] |accessdate=7 August 2015}}</ref>

Another Briton, [[William Willett]] championed the use of daylight saving time. It was made law there in 1916.

Hudson's collection of [[insect]]s, the largest in New Zealand, is housed in the [[Museum of New Zealand Te Papa Tongarewa]].
