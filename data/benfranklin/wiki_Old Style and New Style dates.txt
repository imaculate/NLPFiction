[[File:The London Gazette 9198.djvu|thumb|Issue 9198 of ''[[The London Gazette]]'', covering the calendar change in Great Britain. The date heading reads: "From Tuesday September 1, O.S. to Saturday September 16, N.S. 1752".{{sfn|Gazette|9198}}]]

'''Old Style''' ('''O.S.''') and '''New Style''' ('''N.S.''') are terms sometimes used with dates to indicate that the calendar convention used at the time described is different from that in use at the time the document was being written. There were two calendar changes in Great Britain and its colonies, which may sometimes complicate matters: the first was to change the start of the year from [[Lady Day]] (25 March) to 1 January; the second was to discard the [[Julian calendar]] in favour of the [[Gregorian calendar]].<ref name=EC-NA>[http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/pathways/citizenship/rise_parliament/docs/charles_warrant.htm Death warrant of Charles I] web page of the [http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ UK National Archives]. A demonstration of New Style, meaning Julian calendar with a start of year adjustment.</ref><ref name=JRS>Stockton, J.R. [http://www.merlyn.demon.co.uk/miscdate.htm#Styles Date Miscellany I: The Old and New Styles] "The terms 'Old Style' and 'New Style' are now commonly used for both the 'Start of Year' and 'Leap Year' [(Gregorian calendar)] changes (England & Wales: both in 1752; Scotland: 1600, 1752). I believe that, properly and historically, the 'Styles' really refer only to the 'Start of Year' change (from March 25th to January 1); and that the 'Leap Year' change should be described as the change from Julian to Gregorian."</ref><ref name=MS>Spathaky, Mike [http://www.cree.name/genuki/dates.htm Old Style and New Style Dates and the change to the Gregorian Calendar]. "Before 1752, parish registers, in addition to a new year heading after 24th March showing, for example '1733', had another heading at the end of the following December indicating '1733/4'. This showed where the Historical Year 1734 started even though the Civil Year 1733 continued until 24th March. ... We as historians have no excuse for creating ambiguity and must keep to the notation described above in one of its forms. It is no good writing simply 20th January 1745, for a reader is left wondering whether we have used the Civil or the Historical Year. The date should either be written 20th January 1745 OS (if indeed it was Old Style) or as 20th January 1745/6. The hyphen (1745-6) is best avoided as it can be interpreted as indicating a period of time."</ref> Closely related is the custom of [[dual dating]], where writers gave two consecutive years to reflect differences in the starting date of the year, or to include both the Julian and Gregorian dates.

Beginning in 1582, the Gregorian calendar replaced the Julian in [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] countries. This change was implemented subsequently in [[Protestant Reformation|Protestant]] and [[Orthodox Church|Orthodox]] countries, usually at much later dates. In [[England and Wales]], [[Kingdom of Ireland|Ireland]], and the British colonies, the change to the start of the year and the changeover from the Julian calendar occurred in 1752 under the [[Calendar (New Style) Act 1750]]. In [[Kingdom of Scotland|Scotland]], the legal start of the year had already been moved to 1 January (in 1600), but Scotland otherwise continued to use the Julian calendar until 1752. Thus "New Style" can either refer to the [[#Differences in the start of the year|start of year adjustment]], or to the [[#Adoption of the Gregorian calendar|adoption of the Gregorian calendar]]. 

In [[Russia]], new style dates came into use in early 1918. Other countries in [[Eastern Orthodoxy]] adopted new style dating for their [[civil calendar]]s but most continue to use the Julian calendar for religious use. In English-language histories of other countries (especially Russia), the Anglophone OS/NS convention is often used to identify which calendar is being used when giving a date.

When recording British history it is usual to use the dates recorded at the time of the event,{{efn|British official legal documents of the 16th and 17th centuries were usually dated by the [[regnal years of English monarchs|regnal year]] of the monarch. As these commence on the day and date of the monarch's accession, they normally span two consecutive calendar years and have to be calculated accordingly, but the resultant dates should be unambiguous.}} with the year adjusted to start on 1 January. <!--So, for example, the [[Battle of Hastings]] is universally known to have been fought on 14 October 1066. -->But the start of the Julian year was not always 1 January, and was altered at different times in different countries (see [[Julian calendar#New Year's Day|New Year's Day in the Julian calendar]]).

From 1155 to 1752, the civil or legal year in England began on 25 March ([[Lady Day]])<ref>Nørby, Toke. [http://www.norbyhus.dk/calendar.php#England The Perpetual Calendar: What about England?] Version 29 February 2000.</ref>{{sfn|Gerard|1908}} so for example the execution of [[Charles I of England|Charles I]] was recorded at the time in parliament as happening on 30 January 164'''8''' (Old Style).<ref name=regicides>{{cite web|url= http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.asp?compid=26211#s5|title= House of Commons Journal Volume 8, 9 June 1660 (Regicides)|publisher= British History Online|accessdate= 18 March 2007}}</ref> In newer English language texts this date is usually shown as "30 January 164'''9'''" (New Style).<ref name=EC-NA/> The corresponding date in the Gregorian calendar is 9 February 1649, the date by which his contemporaries in some parts of continental Europe would have recorded his execution.

The O.S./N.S. designation is particularly relevant for dates which fall between the start of the "historical year" (1 January) and the official start date, where different. This was 25 March in England, Wales and the colonies<!--Scotland converted the start of year in 1600--> until 1752.

During the years between the first introduction of the Gregorian calendar in continental Europe and its introduction in Britain, contemporary usage in England started to change.<ref name=MS/> In Britain 1 January was celebrated as the New Year festival,<ref>[http://www.pepysdiary.com/archive/1661/12/31/index.php Tuesday 31 December 1661], [http://www.pepysdiary.com Pepys Diary] "I sat down to end my journell for this year, .."</ref> but the "year starting 25th March was called the Civil or Legal Year, although the phrase Old Style was more commonly used."<ref name=MS/> To reduce misunderstandings about the date, it was normal in parish registers to place a new year heading after 24 March (for example "1661") and another heading at the end of the following December, "1661/62", a form of [[dual dating]] to indicate that in the following few weeks the year was 1661 Old Style but 1662 New Style.<ref name=MS-oblique-stroke>Spathaky, Mike [http://www.cree.name/genuki/dates.htm Old Style and New Style Dates and the change to the Gregorian Calendar].

Very occasionally a hyphen is used, as 1733-34."</ref> Some more modern sources, often more academic ones, also use the "1661/62" style for the period between 1 January and 25 March for years before the introduction of the Gregorian calendar in England.

===Scotland===
Scotland had already partly made the change: its calendar year had begun on 1 January since 1600.{{sfn|Steele|2000|page=4}}{{sfn|Bond|1875|loc=See footnote on pages xvii–xviii: original text of the Scottish decree}}

===Adoption of the Gregorian calendar===
{{Main article|Adoption of the Gregorian calendar}}
[[File:William Hogarth 028.jpg|thumb|[[William Hogarth]] painting: ''[[Humours of an Election]]'' (''c.'' 1755), which is the main source for "Give us our Eleven Days".]]
Through the enactment of the British [[Calendar (New Style) Act 1750]] and of the [[Parliament of Ireland|Irish Parliament]]'s ''Calendar (New Style) Act, 1750,{{sfn|Parliament of Ireland|1750}}'' [[Kingdom of Great Britain|Great Britain]], [[Kingdom of Ireland|Ireland]] and the [[British Empire]] (including much of what is now the eastern part of the United States) adopted the Gregorian calendar in 1752, by which time it was necessary to correct by 11 days. Wednesday, 2 September 1752, was followed by Thursday, 14 September 1752. Claims that [[Calendar (New Style) Act 1750#Reaction and effect|rioters demanded "Give us our eleven days"]] grew out of a misinterpretation of a painting by [[William Hogarth]].<ref>{{harvnb|Poole|1995|pp=95–139}}.</ref> The British tax year traditionally began on [[Lady Day]] (25 March) on the Julian calendar and this became 5 April, which was the "[[#Differences between the start of the year|New Style]]" equivalent.<ref>{{harvnb|Cheney|Jones|2000|p=18}}</ref> A 12th skipped Julian leap day in 1800 changed its start to 6 April. It was not changed when a 13th Julian leap day was skipped in 1900, so the tax year in the United Kingdom still begins on 6 April.{{sfn|Philip|1921|p=24}}

==Adoption in the Americas==
The European colonies of [[the Americas]] adopted the new style calendar when their mother countries did. In what is now the continental United States, the French and Spanish possessions did so before the British colony. In [[Alaska]], the change took place after the United States [[Alaska Purchase|purchased Alaska]] from Russia.  Friday, 6 October 1867 was followed by Friday, 18 October. Instead of 12 days, only 11 were skipped, and the day of the week was repeated on successive days, because at the same time the [[International Date Line]] was moved, from following Alaska's eastern border with Canada to following its new western border, now with Russia.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Dershowitz |first1=Nachum |last2=Reingold |first2=Edward M. |date=2008 |title=Calendrical Calculations |url= |location=[[Cambridge]] |publisher=Cambridge University Press |page=47 |isbn=9780521885409 |author-link= }}</ref>

==Anglophone usage describing events in other countries==
It is common in English language publications to use the familiar Old Style and/or New Style terms when discussing events and personalities in other countries, especially with reference to the [[Russian Empire]] and the very-early [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic|Russian Soviet]]. For example, in the article "The October (November) Revolution" the ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]'' uses the format of "25 October (7 November, New Style)" to describe the date of the start of the revolution.{{sfn|EB online|2017}}

When this usage is encountered, the British adoption date is not necessarily intended. The 'start of year' change and the calendar system change were not always adopted concurrently. Similarly, civil and religious adoption may not have happened at the same time (or even at all). [[Adoption of the Gregorian calendar#Adoption in Eastern Europe|In the case of Eastern Europe]], for example, all of these assumptions would be incorrect.

==Transposition of historical event dates and possible date conflicts==
[[File:Thomas Jefferson's Grave Site.jpg|right|thumb|[[Thomas Jefferson]]'s tombstone. Written below the [[epitaph]] is "Born April 2 1743 O.S. Died July 4 1826"]]
Usually, the mapping of new dates onto old dates with a start of year adjustment works well with little confusion for events which happened before the introduction of the Gregorian calendar. For example, the [[Battle of Agincourt]] is well known to have been fought on 25 October 1415, which is [[Saint Crispin's Day]]. But for the period between the first introduction of the Gregorian calendar on 15 October 1582 and its introduction in Britain on 14 September 1752, there can be considerable confusion between events in continental western Europe and in British domains. Events in continental western Europe are usually reported in English language histories using the Gregorian calendar. For example, the [[Battle of Blenheim]] is always given as 13 August 1704. However confusion occurs when an event involves both. For example, [[William III of England]] arrived at [[Brixham]] in England on 5 November (Julian calendar), after setting sail from the Netherlands on 11 November (Gregorian calendar), in 1688.<ref name="C&J19">{{harvnb|Cheney|Jones|2000|p=19}}.</ref>

The [[Battle of the Boyne]] in Ireland took place a few months later on 1 July 1690 (Julian calendar). This maps to 11 July (Gregorian calendar), conveniently close to the Julian date of the subsequent (and more decisive) [[Battle of Aughrim]] on 12 July 1691 (Julian). This latter battle was commemorated annually throughout the 18th century on 12 July,<ref name=Lenihan>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=d8gKAQAAMAAJ|last=Lenihan |first=Pádraig |title=1690 Battle of the Boyne |year=2003 |location=Stroud, Gloucestershire |publisher=Tempus |pages=258–259 |ISBN=0 7524 2597 8 |author-link= }}</ref> following the usual historical convention of commemorating events of that period within Great Britain and Ireland by mapping the Julian date directly onto the modern Gregorian calendar date (as happens for example with [[Guy Fawkes Night]] on 5 November). The Battle of the Boyne was commemorated with smaller parades on 1 July. However, the two events were combined in the late 18th century,<ref name="Lenihan"/> and continue to be celebrated as "[[The Twelfth]]".

Because of the differences, British writers and their correspondents often employed two dates, [[dual dating]], more or less automatically. For this reason, letters concerning diplomacy and international trade sometimes bore both Julian and Gregorian dates to prevent confusion: for example, [[William Boswell|Sir William Boswell]] writing to [[John Coke|Sir John Coke]] from [[The Hague]] dated a letter "12/22 Dec. 1635".<ref name="C&J19"/> In his biography of Dr [[John Dee (mathematician)|John Dee]], ''The Queen's Conjurer'', Benjamin Woolley surmises that because Dee fought unsuccessfully for England to embrace the 1583/84 date set for the change, "England remained outside the Gregorian system for a further 170 years, communications during that period customarily carrying two dates".<ref>{{cite web |first=John |last=Baker |url=http://www2.localaccess.com/marlowe/bacon6.htm |title=Why Bacon, Oxford and Other's Weren't Shakespeare |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050404085408/http://www2.localaccess.com/marlowe/bacon6.htm |archive-date=4 April 2005}}) uses this quote by Benjamin Woolley and cites ''The Queen's Conjurer, The Science and Magic of Dr. John Dee, Adviser to Queen Elizabeth I'', page 173.</ref> In contrast, [[Thomas Jefferson]], who lived at the time that the British Isles and colonies eventually converted to the Gregorian calendar, instructed that his tombstone bear his date of birth using the Julian calendar (notated  O.S. for Old Style) and his date of death using the Gregorian calendar.<ref>{{cite web |date=June 1995 |url=http://www.monticello.org/site/research-and-collections/old-style|title=Old Style (O.S.)|publisher=monticello.org|accessdate=6 May 2017}}</ref> At Jefferson's birth the difference was eleven days between the Julian and Gregorian calendars; thus his birthday of 2 April in the Julian calendar is 13 April in the Gregorian calendar. Similarly, [[George Washington]] is nowadays officially reported as having been born on 22 February 1732, rather than on 11 February 1731/32 (Julian calendar).<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://www.slate.com/id/2134455/|title=What's Benjamin Franklin's Birthday?|first=Daniel|last=Engber|date=18 January 2006|journal=[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]|accessdate=8 February 2013}} (Both Franklin's and Washington's confusing birth dates are clearly explained).</ref>

There is some evidence that the calendar change was not easily accepted. Many British people continued to celebrate their holidays "Old Style" well into the 19th century,{{efn|See also [[Little Christmas]].}} a practice that according to the author Karen Bellenir reveals a deep emotional resistance to calendar reform.<ref>{{cite book |last=Bellenir |first=Karen |title=Religious Holidays and Calendars |publisher=Omnigraphics |year=2004 |location=Detroit |page=33}}</ref>

==Differences between Julian and Gregorian dates==
{{Main article|Gregorian calendar#Difference between Gregorian and Julian calendar dates}}
The change arose from the realisation that the correct figure for the number of days in a year is not 365.25 (365 days 6 hours) as assumed by the Julian calendar but [[Tropical year#Mean tropical year current value|rather less]]: the Julian calendar has too many [[leap year]]s. The consequence was that the basis for [[Computus|calculation of the date of Easter]] as [[Easter controversy|decided in the 4th century]] had drifted from [[March equinox|reality]]. The Gregorian calendar reform also dealt with the accumulated difference between these figures, between the years 325 and 1582 (1752 in the British Empire), by skipping 10 days (11 in the case of Great Britain, including her colonies and Ireland) to restore the date of the vernal equinox to approximately 21 March, the approximate date it occurred at the time of the [[First Council of Nicea]] in 325.
