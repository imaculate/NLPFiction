'''Benjamin Franklin House''' is a museum in a terraced Georgian house at 36 [[Craven Street]], [[London]], close to [[Trafalgar Square]]. It is the only surviving former residence of [[Benjamin Franklin]], one of the [[Founding Fathers of the United States]]. The house dates from c. 1730, and Franklin lived and worked there for sixteen years.<ref name="Huntington">[http://www.americanheritage.com/articles/magazine/ah/2006/2/2006_2_49.shtml Tom Huntington] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091005062210/http://www.americanheritage.com/articles/magazine/ah/2006/2/2006_2_49.shtml |date=5 October 2009 }} "Franklin's Last Home," ''American Heritage'', April/May 2006.</ref><ref name="TelographLunchBreak">{{cite news|last1=Attwooll|first1=Jolyon|title=London in your lunch break: Benjamin Franklin's House|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/destinations/europe/uk/london/london-in-your-lunch-break/8910256/London-in-your-lunch-break-Benjamin-Franklins-House.html|accessdate=15 July 2016|agency=Telograph|date=23 Nov 2011}}</ref> The museum opened to the public on 17 January 2006.<ref name="TelographLunchBreak"/> The chairman is American-British investment banker and philanthropist [[John Studzinski]].<ref>[http://www.benjaminfranklinhouse.org/site/sections/about_house/govern.htm Benjamin Franklin House – Governance].

The house is [[Listed building#England and Wales|listed Grade I]] on the [[National Heritage List for England]] for its historic association with Franklin.<ref name=NHLE>{{NHLE|num=1066930|desc=36, Craven Street WC2|access-date=5 March 2018|mode=cs2}}</ref>
== Conservation ==

The house was renovated and restored in 1998 by The Friends of Benjamin Franklin House in order for the house to be turned into a museum.<ref name="LondonistBones">{{cite news|last1=Craig|first1=Zoe|title=The Secret Bones In Benjamin Franklin's Basement|url=http://londonist.com/2016/05/the-bones-in-benjamin-franklins-basement|accessdate=15 July 2016|agency=Londonist|date=18 May 2016}}</ref> During the excavation, more than numerous human bones and fragments of skeleton were found consisting of the remains of around 10 bodies; six of them children.<ref name="LondonistBones"/><ref name="CravenStreetGazette">[http://www.benjaminfranklinhouse.org/site/sections/news/pdf/Issue2.pdf Newsletter of the friends of Benjamin Franklin House], Issue 2, Autumn 1998. benjaminfranklinhouse.org</ref>

Tests conducted on the remains showed that they were around 200 years old, which means that they may have been buried in the basement at the same time that Franklin was living there. However, further evidence showed that a close friend of Franklin, [[William Hewson (surgeon)|William Hewson]], was the one responsible for the human remains. Hewson, an early [[anatomist]], had lived in the house for two years and had been working in secret, since there were still legal issues in dissecting certain [[cadaver]]s at the time.<ref name="LondonistBones"/><ref name="CravenStreetGazette"/> Franklin likely knew what Hewson was doing, but probably did not participate in the dissections.<ref name="CravenStreetGazette"/>

The museum at 36 Craven Street is a Grade I [[Listed building|listed property]]<ref name="TelographLunchBreak"/> and retains a number of its original features (include original floorboards, original ceilings, and original staircases) with relatively few later alterations. Current conservation policies emphasise the need for minimal modern interventions.

Artefacts at the house include a modern, playable replica [[Glass harmonica|glass armonica]], based on Franklin's design.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.benjaminfranklinhouse.org/site/sections/news/past-events2016.html|title=Benjamin Franklin House - News|website=www.benjaminfranklinhouse.org|access-date=2017-01-24}}</ref>

== Modern facilities ==
The "Historical Experience" includes an actor portraying historical characters associated with the house along with dialog, sound, lighting, and special effects. The character used in the "Historical Experience" is [[Polly Hewson]], the daughter of Franklin's landlady<ref name="TelographLunchBreak"/> who became a "second daughter" to Franklin.

The "Student Science Centre" allows students to re-create experiments from Franklin's sojourn in London. It includes a Medical History Room (focused on the medical research of William Hewson, who did his work from the house for a time), a Discovery Room (containing historical artifacts), and a Demonstration Room (in which students can replicate Franklin's experiments).

The Benjamin Franklin House is open free-of-charge to school visits on Tuesdays. Although designed for [[Key Stage 2|key stage 2]] students, visits can be tailored for students of all key stages.<ref>Benjamin Franklin House School Visits, http://www.benjaminfranklinhouse.org/site/sections/education/school_visits.htm</ref>

The "Scholarship Centre" on the top floor of the House is a centre for study of the many subjects Franklin pursued.

Benjamin Franklin House runs an annual Literary Prize in which people interpret a Benjamin Franklin quote in its significance today.
