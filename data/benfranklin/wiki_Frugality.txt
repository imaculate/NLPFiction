'''Frugality''' is the quality of being frugal, sparing, thrifty, prudent or economical in the [[consumption (economics)|consumption]] of consumable [[resources]] such as [[food]], [[time]] or [[money]], and avoiding waste, lavishness or extravagance.<ref name=cent>{{cite web|title=frugal|url=http://www.leoyan.com/century-dictionary.com/cent2jpgframes.php?volno=03&page=2393|work=Century Dictionary Online|accessdate=April 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Macdonald|first=A.M.

In [[behavioral science]], frugality has been defined as the tendency to acquire goods and services in a restrained manner, and resourceful use of already owned economic goods and services, to achieve a longer term [[goal]].<ref>{{cite journal|last=Lastovicka|first=J. L.|author2=Bettencourt, L. A.|author3= Hughner, R. S.|author4= Kuntze, R. J. |title=Lifestyle of the tight and frugal: Theory and measurement|journal=Journal of Consumer Research|year=1999|volume=26|pages=85–98|doi=10.1086/209552}}</ref>

==Strategies==
Common [[strategies]] of frugality include the reduction of [[waste]], curbing costly [[habituation|habit]]s, suppressing instant [[gratification]] by means of fiscal self-restraint, seeking [[efficiency (economics)|efficiency]], avoiding traps, defying expensive [[social norms]], detecting and avoiding [[Psychological manipulation|manipulative]] advertising, embracing cost-free options, using [[barter]], and staying well-informed about local circumstances and both market and product/service realities. Frugality may contribute to health by leading people to avoid products that are both expensive and unhealthy when used to excess.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Rose|first=P.|author2=Toney Smith, S.|author3=Segrist, D. J.|title=Too cheap to chug: Frugality as a buffer against college-student drinking |journal=Journal of Consumer Behaviour|year=2010|volume=9|pages=228–238|doi=10.1002/cb.314}}</ref> Frugal living is mainly practiced by those who aim to cut expenses, have more money, and get the most they possibly can from their money.<ref>Gorman, C. The Frugal Mind: 1,479 Money Saving Tips for Surviving the 1990s. Nottingham Books, 1990</ref>

==Philosophy==
In the context of some belief systems, frugality is a ''[[philosophy]]'' in which one does not trust (or is deeply wary of) "expert" knowledge from commercial markets or corporate cultures, claiming to know what is in the best economic, material, or spiritual interests of the individual.<ref>Child, Hamilton: "How to Succeed in Business," Gazetteer and Business Directory of Ontario County, N.Y., for 1867-8, Page 91 e.g. H. Child, 1867</ref>

Different spiritual communities consider frugality to be a virtue or a spiritual discipline.<ref>Austin, Richard Cartwright: "Environmental Theology", Page 169. Creekside Press, 1990</ref> The [[Religious Society of Friends]] and the [[Puritan]]s are examples of such groups.<ref>Mecklin, John M.: "An Introduction to Social Ethics, The Social Conscience in a Democracy", Page 254. Harcourt, Brace and Howe, 1920</ref> The basic philosophy behind this is the idea that people ought to save money in order to allocate it to more charitable purposes, such as helping others in need.<ref>Watkinson, William L.: "Frugality in the Spiritual Life", Page 7. F. H. Revell company, 1908</ref>

There are also [[environmentalists]] who consider frugality to be a virtue<ref>[[George Fillmore Swain|Swain, George Fillmore]]; ''Conservation of Water by Storage'', [[Yale University Press]], 1915, p. 26 e.g.</ref> through which humans can make use of their ancestral skills as hunter-gatherers, carrying little and needing little, and finding meaning in nature instead of man-made conventions or religion. [[Henry David Thoreau]] expressed a similar philosophy in ''[[Walden]]'', with his zest for self-reliance and minimal possessions while [[simple living|living simply]] in the woods.<ref>Thoreau, Henry David: "Walden", Page 184 e.g. T. Y. Crowell & co, 1910</ref>

==Corporate world==
Frugality has been adopted as a strategic imperative by large enterprises as a means of cost reduction<ref>Hill, Phil: "http://freecheap.blogspot.com/" 2010</ref> through engenderment of a philosophy of careful spending amongst the workforce.<ref>Woerner, Stephanie L.; "Networked at Cisco", Page 13. Center for eBusiness, Sloan School of Management, MIT, 2001</ref> Cost reduction is often perceived negatively, be it within a corporate organisation or in society, so inviting each employee to embrace frugality transfers the burden of cost reduction from management to the employee. In doing so, corporations introduce a moral obligation to cost cutting, proposing the notion that careful management of costs is in the company, shareholder and employee's best interests.
