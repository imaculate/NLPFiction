<!-- Epidemiology and history -->
Gout affects about 1 to 2% of the [[Western world|Western]] population at some point in their lives.<ref name=Lancet2010/> It has become more common in recent decades.<ref name=Lancet2010/> This is believed to be due to increasing risk factors in the population, such as [[metabolic syndrome]], longer life expectancy, and changes in diet.<ref name=Lancet2010/> Older males are most commonly affected.<ref name=Lancet2010/> Gout was historically known as "the disease of kings" or "rich man's disease".<ref name=Lancet2010/><ref name=Dic>{{cite web |url=http://medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/Rich+Man%27s+Disease |title=Rich Man's Disease – definition of Rich Man's Disease in the Medical dictionary |website= Free Online Medical Dictionary, Thesaurus and Encyclopedia}}</ref> It has been recognized at least since the time of the [[ancient Egyptians]].<ref name=Lancet2010/>

==Signs and symptoms==
[[Image:Gout2010.JPG|thumb|upright=1.4|alt=side view of a foot showing a red patch of skin over the joint at the base of the big toe|Gout presenting as slight redness in the metatarsal-phalangeal joint of the big toe]]
Gout can present in multiple ways, although the most usual is a recurrent attack of acute [[inflammatory arthritis]] (a red, tender, hot, swollen joint).<ref name=Review08/> The [[Metatarsophalangeal articulations|metatarsal-phalangeal joint]] at the base of the big toe is affected most often, accounting for half of cases.<ref name=PM2010/> Other joints, such as the heels, knees, wrists, and fingers, may also be affected.<ref name=PM2010/> Joint pain usually begins over 2–4&nbsp;hours and during the night.<ref name=PM2010/> This is mainly due to lower body temperature.<ref name=Egg2007>{{cite journal |author=Eggebeen AT |title=Gout: an update |journal=Am Fam Physician |volume=76 |issue=6 |pages=801–8 |year=2007 |pmid=17910294}}</ref> Other symptoms may rarely occur along with the joint pain, including [[fatigue (medical)|fatigue]] and a high fever.<ref name=PM2010/><ref name=Egg2007/>

Long-standing elevated [[uric acid]] levels ([[hyperuricemia]]) may result in other symptoms, including hard, painless deposits of uric acid crystals known as [[tophi]]. Extensive tophi may lead to chronic [[arthritis]] due to bone erosion.<ref name=Nature2009/> Elevated levels of uric acid may also lead to crystals precipitating in the [[kidney]]s, resulting in [[kidney stone|stone]] formation and subsequent [[acute uric acid nephropathy|urate nephropathy]].<ref name=German09/>

==Cause==
The [[crystallization]] of [[uric acid]], often related to relatively high levels in the blood, is the underlying cause of gout. This can occur because of diet, genetic predisposition, or underexcretion of [[Uric acid#Solubility of uric acid and its salts|urate]], the salts of uric acid.<ref name=Review08/> Underexcretion of uric acid by the kidney is the primary cause of hyperuricemia in about 90% of cases, while overproduction is the cause in less than 10%.<ref name=Lancet2010/> About 10% of people with [[hyperuricemia]] develop gout at some point in their lifetimes.<ref name="pmid18327257">{{cite journal  |vauthors=Vitart V, Rudan I, Hayward C, etal |title=SLC2A9 is a newly identified urate transporter influencing serum urate concentration, urate excretion and gout |journal=Nat.

When levels are between 415 and 530&nbsp;μmol/l (7 and 8.9&nbsp;mg/dl), the risk is 0.5% per year, while in those with a level greater than 535&nbsp;μmol/l (9&nbsp;mg/dL), the risk is 4.5% per year.<ref name=Egg2007/>

===Lifestyle===
Dietary causes account for about 12% of gout,<ref name=Review08/> and include a strong association with the consumption of alcohol, [[fructose]]-sweetened drinks, meat, and seafood.<ref name=Nature2009/><ref name=Epi2008/> Among foods richest in purines yielding high amounts of uric acid are dried [[anchovy|anchovies]], shrimp, [[organ meat]], dried mushrooms, seaweed, and [[beer yeast]].<ref>{{cite journal|pmid=24553148|year=2014|author1=Kaneko|first1=K|title=Total purine and purine base content of common foodstuffs for facilitating nutritional therapy for gout and hyperuricemia|journal=Biological and Pharmaceutical Bulletin|volume=37|issue=5|pages=709–21|last2=Aoyagi|first2=Y|last3=Fukuuchi|first3=T|last4=Inazawa|first4=K|last5=Yamaoka|first5=N|url=https://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/article/bpb/37/5/37_b13-00967/_html/-char/en|doi=10.1248/bpb.b13-00967}}</ref> Chicken and potatoes also appear related.<ref name=Maj2018>{{cite journal |last1=Major |first1=Tanya J |last2=Topless |first2=Ruth K |last3=Dalbeth |first3=Nicola |last4=Merriman |first4=Tony R |title=Evaluation of the diet wide contribution to serum urate levels: meta-analysis of population based cohorts |journal=BMJ |date=10 October 2018 |pages=k3951 |doi=10.1136/bmj.k3951}}</ref> Other triggers include [[physical trauma]] and surgery.<ref name=Lancet2010/>

Gout is partly genetic, contributing to about 60% of [[Genetic variability|variability]] in uric acid level.<ref name=Lancet2010/> The ''[[SLC2A9]]'', ''[[SLC22A12]]'', and ''[[ABCG2]]'' genes have been found to be commonly associated with gout and variations in them can approximately double the risk.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Merriman|first=TR|author2=Dalbeth, N|title=The genetic basis of hyperuricaemia and gout|journal=Joint, Bone, Spine : Revue du Rhumatisme|year=2011|volume=78|issue=1|pages=35–40|pmid=20472486|doi=10.1016/j.jbspin.2010.02.027}}</ref><ref name="Reginato2012">{{cite journal |vauthors=Reginato AM, Mount DB, Yang I, Choi HK |title=The genetics of hyperuricaemia and gout |journal=Nature Reviews Rheumatology|year=2012 |pmid=22945592 |doi=10.1038/nrrheum.2012.144 |volume=8 |issue=10 |pages=610–21 |pmc=3645862 }}</ref> [[Loss-of-function mutation]]s in ''SLC2A9'' and ''SLC22A12'' causes low blood uric acid levels by reducing urate absorption and unopposed urate secretion.<ref name=Reginato2012/> The rare genetic disorders [[Tamm-Horsfall protein|familial juvenile hyperuricemic nephropathy]], [[medullary cystic kidney disease]], [[PRPSAP1|phosphoribosylpyrophosphate synthetase]] superactivity and [[hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase]] deficiency as seen in [[Lesch-Nyhan syndrome]], are complicated by gout.<ref name=Lancet2010/>

===Medical conditions===
Gout frequently occurs in combination with other medical problems.

===Medication===
[[Diuretic]]s have been associated with attacks of gout, but a low dose of [[hydrochlorothiazide]] does not seem to increase risk.<ref name=CFP09/> Other medications that increase the risk include [[niacin]], [[aspirin]] (acetylsalicylic acid), [[ACE inhibitor]]s, [[angiotensin receptor blocker]]s (except losartan), [[beta blocker]]s, [[ritonavir]], and [[pyrazinamide]].<ref name=Nature2009/><ref name="Dalbeth2016"/> The [[immunosuppressive drug]]s [[ciclosporin]] and [[tacrolimus]] are also associated with gout,<ref name=Lancet2010/> the former more so when used in combination with hydrochlorothiazide.<ref>{{cite book |editor1-first=Gary S. |editor1-last=Firestein, MD |editor2-first=Ralph C. |editor2-last=Budd, MD |editor3-first=Edward D. |editor3-last=Harris Jr., MD |editor4-first= Iain B. |editor4-last=McInnes PhD, FRCP |editor5-first=Shaun |editor5-last=Ruddy, MD |editor6-first=John S. |editor6-last=Sergent, MD |title=Kelley's Textbook of Rheumatology |edition=8th |year=2008 |publisher=Elsevier |isbn=978-1-4160-4842-8 |chapter=Chapter 87: Gout and Hyperuricemia}}</ref>

Gout may be diagnosed and treated without further investigations in someone with hyperuricemia and the classic acute arthritis of the base of the great toe (known as podagra).

===Synovial fluid===
A definitive diagnosis of gout is based upon the identification of [[urate|monosodium urate crystals]] in [[synovial fluid]] or a [[tophus]].<ref name=PM2010/> All synovial fluid samples obtained from undiagnosed inflamed joints by [[arthrocentesis]] should be examined for these crystals.<ref name=Lancet2010/> Under [[polarized light]] microscopy, they have a needle-like morphology and strong negative [[birefringence]].

===Differential diagnosis===
The most important [[differential diagnosis]] in gout is [[septic arthritis]].<ref name=Lancet2010/><ref name=PM2010/> This should be considered in those with signs of infection or those who do not improve with treatment.<ref name=PM2010/> To help with diagnosis, a synovial fluid [[Gram stain]] and culture may be performed.<ref name=PM2010/> Other conditions that can look similar include [[pseudogout]], [[rheumatoid arthritis]], [[psoriatic arthritis]], and [[reactive arthritis]].<ref name=PM2010/><ref name="Dalbeth2016"/> Gouty tophi, in particular when not located in a joint, can be mistaken for [[basal cell carcinoma]]<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Jordan DR, Belliveau MJ, Brownstein S, McEachren T, Kyrollos M |title=Medial canthal tophus |journal=Ophthal Plast Reconstr Surg |volume=24 |issue=5 |pages=403–4 |year=2008 |pmid=18806664 |doi=10.1097/IOP.0b013e3181837a31 |url=}}</ref> or other [[neoplasm]]s.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Sano K, Kohakura Y, Kimura K, Ozeki S |title=Atypical Triggering at the Wrist due to Intratendinous Infiltration of Tophaceous Gout |journal=Hand (N Y) |volume=4 |issue=1 |pages=78–80 |date=March 2009 |pmid=18780009 |doi=10.1007/s11552-008-9120-4 |pmc=2654956}}</ref>

==Prevention==
Both lifestyle changes and medications can decrease uric acid levels. Dietary and lifestyle choices that are effective include reducing intake of [[purine]]-rich foods of animal origin such as meat and seafood, alcohol, and [[fructose]] (especially [[high fructose corn syrup]]).<ref name=Be2016/> Eating dairy products, vitamin C, coffee, and cherries may help prevent gout attacks, as does losing weight.<ref name=Be2016/><ref name=2014rev>{{cite journal|last1=Bitik|first1=B|last2=Öztürk|first2=MA|title=An old disease with new insights: Update on diagnosis and treatment of gout|journal=European Journal of Rheumatology|date=June 2014|volume=1|issue=2|pages=72–77|pmid=27708879|url=http://www.eurjrheumatol.org/sayilar/196/buyuk/72-771.pdf|doi=10.5152/eurjrheumatol.2014.021|pmc=5042282|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170811235154/http://www.eurjrheumatol.org/sayilar/196/buyuk/72-771.pdf|archivedate=2017-08-11|df=}}</ref> Gout may be secondary to [[sleep apnea]] via the release of purines from oxygen-starved cells.

The term  "gout" was initially used by Randolphus of Bocking, around 1200 AD. It is derived from the [[Latin]] word ''gutta'', meaning "a drop" (of liquid).<ref name="Pillinger"/> According to the [[Oxford English Dictionary]], this is derived from [[humorism]] and "the notion of the 'dropping' of a morbid material from the blood in and around the joints".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/80290 |title=gout, n.1 |website=Oxford English Dictionary, Second edition, 1989 |accessdate=18 September 2011}}</ref>

<blockquote>Again thick urine, the sediment from which is white, indicates that pain and disease are to be apprehended in the region of joints or viscera... Joint troubles in the hands and feet are very frequent and persistent, such as occur in cases of podagra and cheiragra. These seldom attack eunuchs or boys before coition with a woman, or women except those in whom the menses have become suppressed... some have obtained lifelong security by refraining from wine, mead and [[sexual intercourse|venery]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Celsus/4*.html |title=On Medicine |author=  A. Cornelius Celsus |at=Book IV |website=University of Chicago}}</ref></blockquote>

In 1683, [[Thomas Sydenham]], an English physician, described its occurrence in the early hours of the morning and its predilection for older males:
<blockquote>Gouty patients are, generally, either old men or men who have so worn themselves out in youth as to have brought on a premature old age—of such dissolute habits none being more common than the premature and excessive indulgence in venery and the like exhausting passions. The victim goes to bed and sleeps in good health. About two o'clock in the morning he is awakened by a severe pain in the great toe; more rarely in the heel, ankle, or instep. The pain is like that of a dislocation and yet parts feel as if cold water were poured over them. Then follows chills and shivers and a little fever... The night is passed in torture, sleeplessness, turning the part affected and perpetual change of posture; the tossing about of body being as incessant as the pain of the tortured joint and being worse as the fit comes on.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/h2g2/A11102491 |title=Gout – The Affliction of Kings |website=h2g2 |publisher=BBC |date=December 23, 2012 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100911065930/http://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/h2g2/A11102491 |archivedate=September 11, 2010 |df= }}</ref></blockquote>
