Charleston was founded in 1670 as Charles Town, honoring [[Charles II of England|King Charles{{nbsp}}II]] of [[kingdom of England|England]]. Its initial location at Albemarle Point on the west bank of the Ashley River (now [[Charles Towne Landing]]) was abandoned in 1680 for its present site, which became the fifth-largest city in [[British North America|North America]] within ten years. Despite its size, it remained [[Municipal corporation|unincorporated]] throughout the colonial period; its government was handled directly by a colonial legislature and a governor sent by London. Election districts were organized according to [[Anglicanism|Anglican]] parishes, and some social services were managed by Anglican wardens and vestries. Charleston adopted its present spelling with its incorporation as a [[City (United States)|city]] in 1783 at the close of the [[American Revolution|Revolutionary War]]. Population growth in the interior of South Carolina influenced the removal of the state government to [[Columbia, South Carolina|Columbia]] in 1788, but the port city remained among the ten largest cities in the United States through the [[1840 U.S. Census|1840 census]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/population/documentation/twps0027/tab07.txt|title=Population of the 100 Largest Urban Places: 1840|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080420110123/http://www.census.gov/population/documentation/twps0027/tab07.txt|archivedate=April 20, 2008|df=mdy-all}}</ref> Historians estimate that "nearly half of all Africans brought to America arrived in Charleston", most at Gadsden's Wharf.<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/28/arts/charleston-international-african-american-museum.html Michael Kimmelman, "Charleston Needs That African American Museum.

==Geography==
[[File:Charlestonriversmap.png|right|thumb|Map showing the major rivers of Charleston and the Charleston Harbor watershed]]

The city proper consists of six distinct districts.
*'''Downtown''', or sometimes referred to as '''The Peninsula''', is Charleston's center city separated by the Ashley River to the west and the Cooper River to the east.
*'''[[West Ashley]]''', residential area to the west of Downtown bordered by the Ashley River to the east and the Stono River to the west.
*'''[[Johns Island, South Carolina|Johns Island]]''', far western limits of Charleston home to the [[Angel Oak]], bordered by the Stono River to the east, Kiawah River to the south and [[Wadmalaw Island]] to the west.
*'''[[James Island (South Carolina)|James Island]]''', popular residential area between Downtown and the town of [[Folly Beach, South Carolina|Folly Beach]] where the [[McLeod Plantation]] is located.
*'''Cainhoy Peninsula''', far eastern limits of Charleston bordered by the Wando River to the west and Nowell Creek to the east.
*'''[[Daniel Island]]''', fast-growing residential area to the north of downtown, east of the Cooper River and west of the Wando River.

===Topography===
{{see also|Charleston Harbor}}
The incorporated city fit into {{convert|4|-|5|sqmi|sp=us}} as late as the [[First World War]],{{sfnp|''EB''|1878|p=428}}{{sfnp|''EB''|1911|p=943}} but has since greatly expanded, crossing the [[Ashley River (South Carolina)|Ashley River]] and encompassing [[James Island (South Carolina)|James Island]] and some of [[Johns Island (South Carolina)|Johns Island]]. The city limits also have expanded across the Cooper River, encompassing [[Daniel Island]] and the [[Cainhoy]] area. The present city has a total area of {{convert|330.2|km2|order=flip}}, of which {{convert|282.2|km2|order=flip}} is land and {{convert|47.9|km2|order=flip}} is covered by water. [[North Charleston]] blocks any expansion up the peninsula, and [[Mt Pleasant, South Carolina|Mount Pleasant]] occupies the land directly east of the Cooper River.

[[Charleston Harbor]] runs about {{convert|7|miles|sp=us|0}} southeast to the Atlantic with an average width of about {{convert|2|miles|sp=us}}, surrounded on all sides except its entrance. [[Sullivan's Island]] lies to the north of the entrance and [[Morris Island]] to the south. The entrance itself is about {{convert|1|mi|sp=us|0}} wide; it was originally only {{convert|18|ft|sp=us|0}} deep, but began to be enlarged in the 1870s.{{sfnp|''EB''|1878|p=428}} The tidal rivers ([[Wando River|Wando]], Cooper, [[Stono River|Stono]], and Ashley) are evidence of a [[Submergent coastline|submergent]] or drowned coastline. There is a submerged river delta off the mouth of the harbor and the Cooper River is deep.

===Climate===
[[File:Building wrecked by Hugo.jpg|upright=1.15|left|thumb|Damage left from [[Hurricane Hugo]] in 1989]]
Charleston has a [[humid subtropical climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification]] ''Cfa''), with mild winters, hot, humid summers, and significant rainfall all year long. Summer is the wettest season; almost half of the annual rainfall occurs from June to September in the form of [[thundershower]]s. Fall remains relatively warm through the middle of November. Winter is short and mild, and is characterized by occasional rain. Measurable snow (≥{{convert|0.1|in|cm|abbr=on|disp=or}}) only occurs several times per decade at the most however freezing rain is more common; a snowfall/freezing rain event on January 3, 2018 was the first such event in Charleston since December 26, 2010.<ref name="NWS Charleston, SC (CHS)"/> However, {{convert|6.0|in|cm|abbr=on}} fell at the airport on December 23, 1989, the largest single-day fall on record, contributing to a single-storm and seasonal record of {{convert|8.0|in|cm|abbr=on}} snowfall.<ref name="NWS Charleston, SC (CHS)"/>

The highest temperature recorded within city limits was {{convert|104|°F|0}} on June 2, 1985, and June 24, 1944, and the lowest was {{convert|7|°F|0}} on [[Great Blizzard of 1899|February 14, 1899]]. At the airport, where official records are kept, the historical range is {{convert|105|°F|0}} on August 1, 1999, down to {{convert|6|°F|0}} on [[January 1985 Arctic outbreak|January 21, 1985]].<ref name="NWS Charleston, SC (CHS)"/> Hurricanes are a major threat to the area during the summer and early fall, with several severe hurricanes hitting the area—most notably [[Hurricane Hugo]] on September 21, 1989 (a [[Saffir-Simpson hurricane scale|category 4]] storm). The dewpoint in June to August ranges from {{convert|19.9|to|21.9|°C|1|order=flip}}.<ref name="WMO 1961–90 KCHS"/>

===Metropolitan Statistical Area===
The [[Charleston, South Carolina metropolitan area|Charleston–North Charleston–Summerville Metropolitan Statistical Area]] consists of three counties: [[Charleston County, South Carolina|Charleston]], [[Berkeley County, South Carolina|Berkeley]], and [[Dorchester County, South Carolina|Dorchester]]. As of the 2013 U.S. Census, the metropolitan statistical area had a total population of 712,239 people. [[North Charleston, South Carolina|North Charleston]] is the second-largest city in the Charleston–North Charleston–Summerville Metropolitan Statistical Area and ranks as the third-largest city in the state; [[Mount Pleasant, South Carolina|Mount Pleasant]] and [[Summerville, South Carolina|Summerville]] are the next-largest cities. These cities combined with other incorporated and unincorporated areas along with the city of Charleston form the [[United States Urban Areas & Urban Clusters|Charleston-North Charleston Urban Area]] with a population of 548,404 {{As of|2010|lc=y}}.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/geo/www/ua/ua2k.txt |title=List of Populations of Urbanized Areas |publisher=U.S. Census Bureau |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/68OJFtype?url=http://www.census.gov/geo/www/ua/ua2k.txt |archivedate=June 13, 2012 |accessdate=2012-06-13 |df=mdy }}</ref> The metropolitan statistical area also includes a separate and much smaller urban area within Berkeley County, [[Moncks Corner, South Carolina|Moncks Corner]] (with a 2000 population of 9,123).

The traditional parish system persisted until the [[Reconstruction Era]], when counties were imposed.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}} Nevertheless, traditional parishes still exist in various capacities, mainly as public service districts. When the city of Charleston was formed, it was defined by the limits of the Parish of St. Philip and St. Michael, now also includes parts of St. James' Parish, St. George's Parish, St. Andrew's Parish, and St. John's Parish, although the last two are mostly still incorporated rural parishes.

After [[Charles II of England|Charles{{nbsp}}II]] was [[English Restoration|restored]] to the [[Monarchy of England|English throne]] in 1660, he granted the [[Colonial charters in the Thirteen Colonies|chartered]] [[Province of Carolina]] to eight of his loyal friends, known as the [[Lords Proprietors]], on March 24, 1663. It took seven years before the group arranged for settlement expeditions. In 1670, [[List of colonial governors of South Carolina|Governor]] [[William Sayle]] brought over several shiploads of settlers from [[Bermuda]], which lies due east of Charleston although closer to [[Cape Hatteras, North Carolina|Cape Hatteras]] in [[North Carolina]], and [[Barbados]] in the eastern Caribbean.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.carolana.com/Carolina/Settlement/barbadian_settlers.html |url-access= |title=Carolina - The Barbadian Settlers, et.al. |last=Lewis |first=J.D. |year=2007 |website=CAROLINA.COM |archive-url= |archive-date= |dead-url= |access-date=January 6, 2018 |quote=Charles Town and surrounding areas were first settled by folks from Barbados and Bermuda }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.oxfordbibliographies.com/view/document/obo-9780199730414/obo-9780199730414-0293.xml |url-access= |title=Barbados in the Atlantic World |last=Roberts |first=Justin |date=April 26, 2018 |orig-year= |publisher=Oxford University Press |doi=10.1093/OBO/9780199730414-0293 |doi-broken-date= |archive-url= |archive-date= |dead-url= |access-date=January 6, 2018 |quote= |ref= }}</ref> These settlers established Charles Town at Albemarle Point on the west bank of the Ashley River a few miles northwest of the present-day city center.{{sfnp|''EB''|1911|p=944}} Charles Town became English-speaking America's first comprehensively planned town with governance, settlement, and development to follow a visionary plan known as the [[Grand Model for the Province of Carolina|Grand Model]] prepared for the Lords Proprietors by [[John Locke]].<ref>Wilson, Thomas D.

At the time of contact, the area was inhabited by the [[Cusabo]] [[Indigenous peoples of the Southeastern Woodlands|Indians]]. The settlers declared war on them in October 1671. The Charlestonians initially allied with the [[Westo]], a slaving northern tribe that had grown powerful trading for guns with the colonists in [[Province of Virginia|Virginia]]. The Westo had made enemies of nearly every other tribe in the region, however, and the English turned on them in 1679. Destroying the Westo by 1680, the settlers were able to use their improved relations with the Cusabo and other tribes to trade, recapture [[runaway slaves]], and engage in slaving raids of [[Spanish Empire|Spanish]]-allied areas.<ref>{{citation |last=Gallay |first=Alan |date=2002 |title=The Indian Slave Trade: The Rise of the English Empire in the American South 1670–1717 |publisher=Yale University Press |location=New Haven |isbn=0-300-10193-7}}</ref>

The [[Anthony Ashley Cooper, 1st Earl of Shaftesbury|Earl of Shaftesbury]], one of the Lords Proprietors, proclaimed that it would soon become a "great port towne".{{citation needed|date=October 2016}} Instead, the initial settlement quickly dwindled away and disappeared while another village—established by the settlers on Oyster Point at the confluence of the Ashley and Cooper Rivers around 1672{{sfnp|''EB''|1911|p=944}}—thrived; this settlement formally replaced the original Charles Town in 1680.{{sfnp|''EB''|1878|p=429}} (The original site is now commemorated as [[Charles Towne Landing]].) Not only was this location more defensible, but it also offered access to a fine natural harbor, which accommodated trade with the [[British West Indies|West Indies]].

On December 7, 1710, the Lords Proprietors decided to separate the [[Province of North Carolina]] from Charles Town's government, although they continued to own and control both regions.

Charles Town was fortified according to a plan developed in 1704 under [[List of colonial governors of South Carolina|Governor]] [[Nathaniel Johnson (politician)|Nathaniel Johnson]]. The early settlement was often subject to attack from sea and land. Both [[Spanish Empire|Spain]] and [[French Colonial Empire|France]] contested England's claims to the region. [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]] and [[pirate]]s both raided it, though the [[Yamasee War]] of the 1710s did not quite reach it.

On September 5–6, 1713 (Julian) a violent Hurricane passed over Charles Town. The [[Circular Congregational Church]] manse was damaged during the storm in which church records were lost. Much of Charles Town was flooded as " the Ashley and Cooper rivers became one". At least seventy lives were lost. The storm was more sever to the North of Charles Town. This storm created a new inlet of [[Currituck County, North Carolina|Currituck]] five miles south of the existing one which later became the accepted dividing line border between North Carolina and Virginia.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.circularchurch.org/history|title=A Brief History of the Circular Church|website=Circular Congregational Church|access-date=2018-11-14}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.usdeadlyevents.com/1713-sep-16-17-hurricane-charleston-and-vicinity-south-carolina-70/|title=1713 — Sep 16-17, Hurricane, Charleston and vicinity, South Carolina — 70 – Deadliest American Disasters and Large-Loss-of-Life Events|website=www.usdeadlyevents.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-11-14}}</ref>

Charles Town was besieged by the pirate "[[Blackbeard]]" for several days in May 1718; his pirates plundered merchant ships and seized the passengers and crew of the ''Crowley''. Blackbeard released his hostages and left in exchange for a chest of medicine from [[Robert Johnson (governor)|Governor Robert Johnson]].<ref name="D. Moore. 1997 pp. 31">D. Moore.

Around 1719, the town's name began to be generally written Charlestown{{sfnp|''EB''|1911|p=944}} and, excepting those fronting the Cooper River, the old walls were largely removed over the next decade. Charlestown was a center for inland colonization of [[Province of South Carolina|South Carolina]], but remained the southernmost point of English settlement on the American mainland until the [[Province of Georgia]] was established in 1732. The first settlers primarily came from England and its colonies on [[Barbados]] and [[Bermuda]]. The latter planters brought African slaves with them who had been purchased in the islands. Early immigrants to the city included [[Huguenot|Protestant French]], Scottish, Irish, and Germans, as well as [[History of the Jews in Charleston, South Carolina|hundreds of Jews]], predominately [[Sephardi]] from England and the Netherlands.<ref name=ed61>{{harvp|Edgar|1998|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=EFSbwGk2szgC&pg=PA61 61]}}</ref> As late as 1830, Charleston's Jewish community was the largest and wealthiest [[Judaism in the United States|in America]].<ref name=ed61/><ref>{{citation |contribution-url=http://www.harvardmagazine.com/on-line/0103137.html |contribution=A 'Portion of the People' |url=http://www.harvardmagazine.com |title=Harvard Magazine |publisher=Harvard University}}</ref> Because of the struggles of the [[English Reformation]] and particularly because the [[Papal States|papacy]] long recognized [[James II of England|James{{nbsp}}II]]'s [[James Francis Edward Stuart|son]] as the rightful [[king of England]], [[king of Scotland|Scotland]], and [[king of Ireland|Ireland]], [[Roman Catholicism in the United States of America|Roman Catholics]] were prohibited from settling in South Carolina throughout the colonial period. ([[Catholic emancipation]] did not proceed in earnest until after the onset of the [[American Revolution]].)

By 1708, however, the majority of the colony's population were [[black African]]s. They had been brought to Charlestown on the [[Middle Passage]], first as "servants" and then as [[slavery in the United States|slave]]s. Of the estimated 400,000 Africans transported to North America for sale as slaves, 40% are thought to have landed at [[Sullivan's Island]] off Charlestown, a "hellish [[Ellis Island]] of sorts",{{citation needed|date=May 2018}} where they were held in a structure of {{convert|16|ft}} by {{convert|30|ft}} called the [[lazaretto]] or pest-house for a minimum of 10 days.<ref name=Ball>{{cite book

[[File:CharlestonSC RainbowRow 500px.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|[[Rainbow Row]]'s 13 houses along East Bay Street formed the commercial center of the town from the [[Colonial history of the United States|colonial period]] through the early 20th century.]]
At the foundation of the town, the principal items of commerce were [[longleaf pine|pine]] [[timber]] and [[Pitch (resin)|pitch]] for [[Sailing ship|ships]] and [[Tobacco in the United States|tobacco]]. The early economy developed around the [[deerskin]] trade, in which colonists used alliances with the [[Cherokee]] and [[Muscogee|Creek]] peoples to secure the raw material used for Europeans' [[buckskin (leather)|buckskin]] pants, gloves, and bookbindings. Records show an average annual export of 54,000 skins for the years from 1699 to 1715. During the height of the trade from 1739 to 1761, {{convert|5,239,350|lb|abbr=on|sp=us}} of deerskin were exported through Charlestown, representing between 0.5–1.25 million deer.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}} To a lesser extent, [[beaver]] [[beaver pelt|pelts]] were also exported. At the same time, Indians were used to enslave one another. From 1680 to 1720, approximately 40,000 native men, women, and children were sold through the port, principally to the West Indies but also to [[Boston, MA|Boston]] and other cities in [[British North America]].<ref name=jpd>{{citation |contribution-url=http://ldhi.library.cofc.edu/exhibits/show/james_poyas_daybook_eighteenth/historical-context-settlement- |title=The James Poyas Daybook: An Account of a Charles Town Merchant, 1760–1765 |publisher=Lowcountry Digital History Initiative |url=http://ldhi.library.cofc.edu/exhibits/show/james_poyas_daybook_eighteenth/introduction |contribution=Settlement, Trade, and Conflicts in Colonial South Carolina}}</ref> The Lowcountry planters did not keep Indian slaves, considering them too prone to escape or revolt, and instead used the proceeds of their sale to purchase black African slaves for their own [[plantation]]s.<ref name=gisc>{{citation |contribution=The Great Indian Slave Caper |contribution-url=http://www.common-place-archives.org/vol-03/no-01/reviews/hall.shtml |title=Common-Place: The Interactive Journal of Early American Life |url=http://www.common-place.org |volume=[http://www.common-place-archives.org/vol-03/no-01/ Vol. III, No. 1] |date=October 2002 |publisher=American Antiquarian Society |location=[[Worcester, MA|Worcester]]}}</ref> The slaveraiding—and the European firearms it introduced—helped destabilize [[Spanish Empire|Spanish]] [[Spanish Florida|Florida]] and [[French colonial empire|French]] [[French Louisiana|Louisiana]] in the 1700s during the [[War of the Spanish Succession]].<ref name=gisc/> But it also provoked the [[Yamasee War]] of the 1710s that nearly destroyed the colony, after which they largely abandoned the Indian slave trade.<ref name=jpd/>

The area's unsuitability for [[Tobacco in the United States|tobacco]] prompted the [[Lowcountry]] [[Planter (American South)|planters]] to experiment with other [[cash crop]]s. The profitability of growing rice led the planters to pay premiums for slaves from the "Rice Coast" who knew its cultivation; their descendants make up the [[Gullah]].<ref>{{citation |contribution-url=http://glc.yale.edu/sites/default/files/files/South%20Carolina%20Rice%20Plantations.pdf |contribution=South Carolina Rice Plantations |url=http://glc.yale.edu/gullah-rice-slavery-and-sierra-leone-american-connection |title=The Gullah: Rice, Slavery, and the Sierra Leone-American Connection |last=Opala |first=Joseph A. |publisher=Yale University Gilder Lehrman Center for the Study of Slavery, Resistance, and Abolition |location=New Haven |date=2016}}</ref> Slaves imported from the Caribbean showed the planter George Lucas's daughter Eliza how to raise and [[indigo dye|use]] [[Indigofera tinctoria|indigo]] for [[Natural dye|dyeing]] in 1747.

The planters attributed the violence to recently imported Africans and agreed to a 10-year moratorium on slave importation through Charlestown, relying on the communities they already possessed. The [[Negro Act of 1740|1740 Negro Act]] also tightened controls, requiring one white for every ten blacks on any plantation and banning slaves from assembling together, growing their own food, earning money, or learning to read. [[African drum|Drums]] were banned owing to Africans' use of them for signaling, although slaves continued to be permitted string and other instruments.{{sfnp|Diouf|1998|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=2VGoAAAAQBAJ&pg=PA273 273]}} When the moratorium expired and Charlestown reopened to the slave trade in 1750, the memory of the Stono Rebellion meant that traders avoided purchasing slaves from the [[Kingdom of Congo|Congo]] and [[Portuguese Angola|Angola]].

By the mid-18th century, Charlestown, described as "the Jerusalem of American slavery, its capital and center of faith",<ref name=Ball />{{rp|89}} was the hub of the Atlantic trade of England's [[southern colonies]]. Even with the decade-long moratorium, its customs processed around 40% of the African slaves brought to North America between 1700 and 1775.<ref name=ed67>{{harvp|Edgar|1998|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=EFSbwGk2szgC&pg=PA67 67]}}</ref> and about half up until the end of the African trade. From 1767, many were sold from the newly constructed [[Gadsden's Wharf]], where six slave ships at a time could tie up.

In 1770, the city's 11,000 inhabitants—half slaves—made it the 4th-largest port after [[Boston, MA|Boston]], [[New York City|New York]], and Philadelphia. The elite used this wealth to create cultural and social development. America's first theater building was constructed here in 1736; it was later replaced by today's Dock Street Theater.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}} St{{nbsp}}Michael's was erected in 1753.{{sfnp|''EB''|1878|p=429}} Benevolent societies were formed by the [[Huguenot]]s, free people of color,{{efn|The Brown Fellowship Society, initially a [[burial society]], operated from 1790 to 1945.}} Germans, and Jews. The [[Charleston Library Society|Library Society]] was established in 1748 by well-born young men who wanted to share the financial cost to keep up with the scientific and philosophical issues of the day. This group also helped establish the town's [[College of Charleston|college]] in 1770, the first in the colony. Until it was acquired by the state university system in 1970, the [[College of Charleston]] was the oldest municipally supported college in the United States.

===American Revolution (1776–1783)===
[[File:CharlestownSC1780.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.9|Charlestown and environs in 1780]]
Delegates for the [[Continental Congress]] were elected in 1774, and South Carolina declared its independence from Britain on the steps of the [[Exchange and Provost|Exchange]]. 
As part of the [[Southern theater of the American Revolutionary War|Southern theater]] of the [[American Revolution]], the British attacked the town in force three times,{{sfnp|''EB''|1878|p=429}} generally assuming that the settlement had a large base of [[Loyalist (American Revolution)|Loyalist]]s who would rally to their cause once given some military support.<ref>{{citation |title=Fusiliers |first=Mark |last=Urban}}</ref> The loyalty of the white southerners had largely been forfeited, however, by British legal cases (such as the 1772 [[Somerset v Stewart|Somerset case]] which marked the prohibition of slavery in [[England and Wales]]; a significant milestone in the [[Abolitionist]] struggle) and military tactics (such as [[Dunmore's Proclamation]] in 1775) that promised the emancipation of the planter's slaves; these efforts did however, unsurprisingly win the allegiance of thousands of [[Black Loyalists]].

The [[Battle of Sullivan's Island]] saw the British fail to capture a partially constructed [[Fort Moultrie|palmetto palisade]] from [[William Moultrie|Col. Moultrie]]'s [[2nd South Carolina Regiment|militia regiment]] on June 28, 1776. The [[Liberty Flag]] used by Moultrie's men formed the basis of the later [[South Carolina flag]], and the victory's anniversary continues to be commemorated as [[Carolina Day]].

Making the capture of Charlestown their chief priority, the British sent [[Henry Clinton (American War of Independence)|Gen. Clinton]], who began his [[siege of Charleston]] on April 1, 1780 with about 14,000 troops and 90 ships.{{sfnp|McCandless|2011|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=NMrqxrLAHUgC&pg=PA89 89]}} Bombardment began on March 11. The rebels, led by Gen. [[Benjamin Lincoln]], had about 5,500 men and inadequate fortifications to repel the forces against them. After the British cut his supply lines and lines of retreat at the battles of [[Battle of Monck's Corner|Monck's Corner]] and [[Battle of Lenud's Ferry|Lenud's Ferry]], Lincoln's surrender on May 12 became the greatest [[List of American Revolutionary War battles|American defeat of the war]].{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

The British continued to hold Charlestown for over a year following [[Siege of Yorktown|their defeat at Yorktown]] in 1781, although they alienated local elites by refusing to restore full civil government. [[Nathanael Greene|General Nathanael Greene]] had entered the state after Cornwallis's [[Battle of Guilford Courthouse|pyrrhic victory]] at [[Guilford Courthouse]] and kept the area under a kind of siege. [[Alexander Leslie (British Army officer)|General Alexander Leslie]], commanding Charlestown, requested a truce in March 1782 to purchase food for his garrison and the town's inhabitants. Greene refused and formed a brigade under [[Mordecai Gist]] to oppose British forays. One such foray in August led to a [[Battle of the Combahee River|British victory]] at the [[Combahee River]], but Charlestown was finally evacuated in December 1782. Gen. Greene presented the leaders of the town with the [[Moultrie Flag]].

From the summer of 1782, French planters fleeing the [[Haitian Revolution]] began arriving in the port with their slaves.{{sfnp|McCandless|2011|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=NMrqxrLAHUgC&pg=PA80 80]}} The [[Yellow Fever Epidemic of 1793|major outbreak of yellow fever]] that occurred in [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania|Philadelphia]] the next year probably spread there from an epidemic these refugees brought to Charleston, although it was not publicly reported at the time. Over the 19th century, the health officials and newspapers of the town came under repeated criticism from Northerners, fellow Southerners, and one another for covering up epidemics as long as possible in order to keep up the city's maritime traffic.<ref name=mcc116>{{harvp|McCandless|2011|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=NMrqxrLAHUgC&pg=PA116 116 ff.]}}</ref> The distrust and mortal risk meant that between July and October each year communication nearly shut down between the city and the surrounding countryside, which was less susceptible to yellow fever.{{sfnp|McCandless|2011|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=NMrqxrLAHUgC&pg=PA113 113]}}

Although [[Columbia, South Carolina|Columbia]] replaced it as the state capital in 1788, Charleston became even more prosperous as [[Eli Whitney]]'s 1793 invention of the [[cotton gin]] sped the processing of the crop over 50 times. The development made [[short-staple cotton]] profitable and opened the upland [[Piedmont (United States)|Piedmont]] region to slave-based cotton plantations, previously restricted to the Sea Islands and Lowcountry. [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|Britain]]'s [[Industrial Revolution#Textile manufacture|Industrial Revolution]]—initially built upon its [[Textile industry#Industrial revolution|textile industry]]—took up the extra production ravenously and cotton became Charleston's major export commodity in the 19th century. The Bank of South Carolina, the second-oldest building in the nation to be constructed as a bank, was established in 1798. Branches of the [[First Bank of the United States|First]] and [[Second Bank of the United States]] were also located in Charleston in 1800 and 1817.

Throughout the [[Antebellum South|Antebellum Period]], Charleston continued to be the only major American city with a majority-slave population.<ref name=macky28/>{{efn|[[Savannah, Georgia|Savannah]], [[Antebellum Georgia|Georgia]], and [[Richmond, Virginia|Richmond]], [[Antebellum Virginia|Virginia]], came closest, reaching 40% at times.<ref name=macky28>{{harvp|McInnis|2005|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=a8g3CwAAQBAJ&pg=PA28 28]}}</ref>}} The city widespread use of slaves as workers was a frequent subject of writers and visitors: a merchant from Liverpool noted in 1834 that "almost all the working population are Negroes, all the servants, the carmen & porters, all the people who see at the stalls in Market, and most of the Journeymen in trades".<ref name=macky48>{{harvp|Thompson|2015|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=Cs27BwAAQBAJ&pg=PP48 48]}}</ref> American traders had been prohibited from equipping the [[Atlantic slave trade]] [[Slave Trade Act of 1794|in 1794]] and all importation of slaves was banned [[Act Prohibiting Importation of Slaves|in 1808]], but American ships long refused to permit [[Blockade of Africa|British inspection]], and smuggling remained common. Much more important was the domestic slave trade, which boomed as the Deep South was developed in new cotton plantations. As a result of the trade, there was a forced migration of more than one million slaves from the Upper South to the Lower South in the antebellum years. During the early 19th century, the first dedicated slave markets were founded in Charleston, mostly near Chalmers & State streets.<ref name=ed67/> Many domestic slavers used Charleston as a port in what was called the coastwise trade, traveling to such ports as Mobile and New Orleans.

Slave ownership was the primary marker of class and even the town's freedmen and [[free people of color]] typically kept slaves if they had the wealth to do so.<ref>Kroger, Larry Black. ''Slaveowners: Free Black Slave Masters in South Carolina, 1790–1860''.

Wages and hiring practices were fixed, identifying badges were sometimes required, and even work songs were sometimes censored.<ref>{{harvp|Thompson|2015|pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=Cs27BwAAQBAJ&pg=PP49 49–50]}}</ref> Punishment was handled out of sight by the city's Work House, whose fees netting the municipal government thousands a year.<ref name=macky225>{{harvp|McInnis|2005|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=a8g3CwAAQBAJ&pg=PA225 225 ff]}}</ref> In 1820, a state law mandated that each individual act of [[manumission|freeing a slave]] henceforth legislative approval, effectively halting the practice.<ref name=bernews/>

The effects of slavery were pronounced on white society as well. The high cost of 19th-century slaves and their high rate of return combined to institute an oligarchic society controlled by about ninety interrelated families, where 4% of the free population controlled half of the wealth, and the lower half of the free population—unable to compete with owned or rented slaves—held no wealth at all.<ref name=macky28/> The white middle class was minimal: Charlestonians generally disparaged hard work as the lot of slaves.<ref name=macky29>{{harvp|McInnis|2005|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=a8g3CwAAQBAJ&pg=PA29 29]}}</ref> All the slaveholders taken together held 82% of the city's wealth and almost all non-slaveholders were poor.<ref name=macky28/> [[Frederick Law Olmsted|Olmsted]] considered their civic elections "entirely contests of money and personal influence" and the oligarchs dominated civic planning:{{refn|[[Frederick Law Olmsted|Olmsted]],<ref>{{citation |last=Olmsted |first=Frederick Law |title=mcJourney in the Seaboard Slave States}}</ref> cited in McInnis.<ref name=macky28/>}} the lack of public parks and amenities was noted, as was the abundance of private gardens in the wealthy's walled estates.{{sfnp|''EB''|1878|p=428}}

In the 1810s, the town's churches intensified their discrimination against their black parishioners, culminating in [[Bethel Methodist Church (Charleston, South Carolina)|Bethel Methodist]]'s 1817 construction of a [[hearse]] house over its black burial ground. 4,376 black Methodists joined [[Morris Brown]] in establishing [[Hampstead Church]], the [[African Methodist Episcopal]] church now known as [[Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church|Mother Emanuel]].<ref name=eame>{{citation |last=Curtis |first=Nancy C. |title=Black Heritage Sites: An African American Odyssey and Finder's Guide |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Rk7NPRm_nB0C |contribution-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Rk7NPRm_nB0C&pg=PA194 |contribution=Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church |publisher=[[American Library Association]] |year=1996 |isbn=978-0-838-90643-9 |location=Chicago |oclc=45885630}}</ref><ref name=longtrouble/> State and city laws prohibited black literacy, limited black worship to daylight hours, and required a majority of any church's parishioners be white.

In 1822, members of the church, led by [[Denmark Vesey]], a lay preacher<ref name=longtrouble/> and carpenter who had bought his freedom after winning a lottery, planned an [[Denmark Vesey's Rebellion|uprising and escape]] to [[Haiti]]—initially for [[Bastille Day]]—that failed when one slave revealed the plot to his master.{{efn|A monument to Vesey as a freedom fighter was long opposed by Charleston's white community but was finally begun in 2010 after a compromise placed it in [[Hampton Park (Charleston)|Hampton Park]], out of the historic district and far from the original proposed site in [[Marion Square]].<ref name=bernews>{{citation |title=Bernews |url=http://bernews.com |contribution-url=http://bernews.com/2011/01/row-over-statue-to-bermudians-slave/ |contribution=Row over Statue to Bermudian's Slave |date=3 January 2011}}</ref>}} Over the next month, the city's intendant (mayor) [[James Hamilton Jr.]] organized a militia for regular patrols, initiated a secret and [[extrajudicial]] tribunal to investigate, and hanged 35 and exiled 35<ref name=longtrouble/> or 37 slaves to [[Spanish Empire|Spanish]] [[Spanish Cuba|Cuba]] for their involvement.<ref name=frazier>{{harvp|Frazier & al.|2016|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=Z7o7CwAAQBAJ&pg=PA70 70]}}</ref> In a sign of Charleston's antipathy to [[Abolitionism in the United States|abolitionists]], a white co-conspirator pled for leniency from the court on the grounds that his involvement had been motivated only by greed and not by any sympathy with the slaves' cause.<ref>{{citation |last=Rubio |first=Philip |contribution=Though He Had a White Face, He Was a Negro in Heart: Examining the White Men Convicted of Supporting the 1822 Denmark Vesey Slave Insurrection |title=South Carolina Historical Magazine |date=January 2012 |volume=Vol. 113 |issue=No. 1 |pp=50–67}}</ref> Governor [[Thomas Bennett Jr.]] had pressed for more compassionate and Christian treatment of slaves but his own had been found involved Vesey's planned uprising.

In 1832, South Carolina passed an ordinance of [[Nullification (U.S. Constitution)|nullification]], a procedure by which a state could, in effect, repeal a federal law; it was directed against the most recent [[tariff]] acts. Soon, federal soldiers were dispensed to Charleston's forts, and five [[United States Coast Guard cutter]]s were detached to Charleston Harbor "to take possession of any vessel arriving from a foreign port, and defend her against any attempt to dispossess the Customs Officers of her custody until all the requirements of law have been complied with." This federal action became known as the Charleston incident. The state's politicians worked on a compromise law in Washington to gradually reduce the tariffs.<ref>{{cite book |last=Willoughby |first=Malcolm F. |authorlink = |title =The U.S. Coast Guard in World War II |publisher =[[United States Naval Institute]] |volume = |edition = |date =1957 |location =[[Annapolis, Maryland]] |page =4 |isbn =}}</ref>

On 27 April 1838, a massive fire broke out around 9:00 in the evening. It raged until noon the next day, damaging over 1,000 buildings, a loss estimated at $3 million at the time. In efforts to put the fire out, all the water in the city pumps was used up. The fire ruined businesses, several churches, a new theater, and the entire market except for the fish section. Most famously, Charleston's Trinity Church was burned. Another important building that fell victim was the new hotel that had been recently built. Many houses were burnt to the ground. The damaged buildings amounted to about one-fourth of all the businesses in the main part of the city. The fire rendered penniless many who were wealthy. Several prominent store owners died attempting to save their establishments. When the many homes and business were rebuilt or repaired, a great cultural awakening occurred. In many ways, the fire helped put Charleston on the map as a great cultural and architectural center. Previous to the fire, only a few homes were styled as Greek Revival; many residents decided to construct new buildings in that style after the conflagration. This tradition continued and made Charleston one of the foremost places to view [[Greek Revival]] architecture. The [[Gothic Revival]] also made a significant appearance in the construction of many churches after the fire that exhibited picturesque forms and reminders of devout European religion.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://historyengine.richmond.edu/episodes/view/3531 |title=History Engine: Tools for Collaborative Education and Research &#124; Episodes |website=Historyengine.richmond.edu |date= |accessdate=2017-05-30}}</ref>

By 1840, the Market Hall and Sheds, where fresh meat and produce were brought daily, became a hub of commercial activity. The [[slave trade]] also depended on the port of Charleston, where ships could be unloaded and the slaves bought and sold. The legal importation of African slaves had ended in 1808, although smuggling was significant. However, the domestic trade was booming. More than one million slaves were transported from the [[Upland South|Upper South]] to the [[Deep South]] in the antebellum years, as cotton plantations were widely developed through what became known as the [[Black Belt (region of Alabama)|Black Belt]]. Many slaves were transported in the [[coastwise slave trade]], with slave ships stopping at ports such as Charleston.

Following [[1860 US presidential election|the election]] of [[Abraham Lincoln]], the [[South Carolina General Assembly]] voted on December 20, 1860 to [[secession|secede]] from the [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]]. On December 27, [[Castle Pinckney]] was surrendered by its garrison to the state militia and, on January 9, 1861, [[The Citadel, The Military College of South Carolina|Citadel]] cadets opened fire on the USS{{nbsp}}''[[Star of the West]]'' as it entered Charleston Harbor.

The first full battle of the [[American Civil War]] occurred on April 12, 1861 when shore batteries under the command of [[Pierre G. T. Beauregard|General Beauregard]] opened fire on the {{nowrap|[[US Army]]-}}held [[Fort Sumter]] in Charleston harbor.{{sfnp|''EB''|1878|p=429}} After a 34-hour bombardment, [[Major Robert Anderson]] surrendered the fort.

On December 11, 1861, an enormous fire burned over {{convert|500|acre|sp=us}} of the city.

Union control of the sea permitted the repeated bombardment of the city, causing vast damage.<ref name=symonds/> Although Admiral Du Pont's naval assault on the town's forts in April 1863 failed,{{sfnp|''EB''|1878|p=429}} the Union navy's blockade shut down most commercial traffic.

General Gillmore's land assault in July 1864 was unsuccessful{{sfnp|''EB''|1878|p=429}} but the fall of [[Columbia, South Carolina|Columbia]] and advance of [[General William T. Sherman]]'s army through the state prompted the Confederates to evacuate the town on February 17, 1865, burning the public buildings, cotton warehouses, and other sources of supply before their departure.{{sfnp|''EB''|1878|p=429}} [[Union Army|Union troops]] moved into the city within the month.{{sfnp|''EB''|1878|p=429}} The War Department recovered what federal property remained and also confiscated the campus of the [[Citadel Military Academy]] and used it as a federal garrison for the next 17 years. The facilities were finally returned to the state and reopened as a military college in 1882 under the direction of Lawrence E. Marichak.

===Postbellum (1865–1945)===
After the defeat of the Confederacy, federal forces remained in Charleston during [[Reconstruction Era|Reconstruction]]. The war had shattered the city's prosperity, but the African-American population surged (from 17,000 in 1860 to over 27,000 in 1880) as freedmen moved from the countryside to the major city.<ref name="strickland">[http://diginole.lib.fsu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=4870&context=etd Jeffrey G.

At the onset of the war, the city had 3,785 free people of color, many of mixed race, making up about 18% of the city's black population and 8% of its total population. Many were educated and practiced skilled crafts;<ref name="johnson"/> they quickly became leaders of South Carolina's [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] and its legislators. Men who had been free people of color before the war comprised 26% of those elected to state and federal office in South Carolina from 1868 to 1876.<ref>E.

By the late 1870s, industry was bringing the city and its inhabitants back to a renewed vitality; new jobs attracted new residents.{{sfnp|''EB''|1878|p=429}} As the city's commerce improved, residents worked to restore or create community institutions. In 1865, the [[College of Charleston|Avery Normal Institute]] was established by the [[American Missionary Association]] as the first free secondary school for Charleston's African American population. [[William Tecumseh Sherman|Gen. Sherman]] lent his support to the conversion of the United States Arsenal into the Porter Military Academy, an educational facility for former soldiers and boys left orphaned or destitute by the war. Porter Military Academy later joined with Gaud School and is now a [[university-preparatory school]], [[Porter-Gaud School]].

In 1875, blacks made up 57% of the city's and 73% of the county's population.<ref name="meeks"/> With leadership by members of the antebellum free black community, historian Melinda Meeks Hennessy described the community as "unique" in being able to defend themselves without provoking "massive white retaliation", as occurred in numerous other areas during [[Reconstruction Era|Reconstruction]].<ref name="meeks">[https://www.jstor.org/stable/27567894 Melinda Meeks Hennessy, "Racial Violence During Reconstruction: The 1876 Riots in Charleston and Cainhoy"], ''South Carolina Historical Magazine'', Vol. 86, No. 2, (April 1985), 104–106 {{subscription required|via JSTOR}}</ref> In the 1876 election cycle, two major riots between black Republicans and white Democrats occurred in the city, in September and the day after the election in November, as well as a violent incident in Cainhoy at an October joint discussion meeting.<ref name="meeks"/>

Violent incidents occurred throughout the Piedmont of the state as white insurgents struggled to maintain [[white supremacy]] in the face of social changes after the war and granting of citizenship to freedmen by federal constitutional amendments. After former Confederates were allowed to vote again, election campaigns from 1872 on were marked by violent intimidation of blacks and Republicans by white Democratic [[paramilitary]] groups, known as the [[Red Shirts (Southern United States)|Red Shirts]]. Violent incidents took place in Charleston on King Street in September 6 and in nearby Cainhoy on October 15, both in association with political meetings before the 1876 election. The Cainhoy incident was the only one statewide in which more whites were killed than blacks.<ref name="foley">[http://www.screconstruction.org/Reconstruction/Sites_of_violence/Entries/1876/10/16_Cainhoy_Riot.html Reconstruction as Armed Insurgency: Cainhoy] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141106211013/http://www.screconstruction.org/Reconstruction/Sites_of_violence/Entries/1876/10/16_Cainhoy_Riot.html |date=November 6, 2014 }}, ''South Carolina during Reconstruction'', 2010–2012, accessed 27 October 2014</ref> The Red Shirts were instrumental in suppressing the black Republican vote in some areas in 1876 and narrowly electing [[Wade Hampton III|Wade Hampton]] as governor, and taking back control of the state legislature. Another riot occurred in Charleston the day after the election, when a prominent Republican leader was mistakenly reported killed.<ref name="meeks"/>

In the early 20th century strong political machines emerged in the city  reflecting economic, class, racial, and ethnic tensions. The factions nearly all opposed U.S. Senator [[Benjamin Tillman|Ben Tillman]] who repeatedly attacked and ridiculed the city in the name of upstate poor farmers. Well organized factions within the Democratic Party in Charleston gave the voters clear choices and played a large role in state politics.<ref>Doyle W. Boggs, "Charleston Politics, 1900-1930: An Overview," ''Proceedings of the South Carolina Historical Association'' 49 (1979) 1-13.</ref>

On August 31, 1886, [[1886 Charleston earthquake|Charleston was nearly destroyed]] by an earthquake. The shock was estimated to have a [[moment magnitude scale|moment magnitude]] of 7.0 and a maximum [[Mercalli intensity scale|Mercalli intensity]] of X (''Extreme''). It was felt as far away as [[Boston]] to the north, [[Chicago]] and [[Milwaukee]] to the northwest, as far west as [[New Orleans]], as far south as [[Cuba]], and as far east as [[Bermuda]]. It damaged 2,000 buildings in Charleston and caused $6 million worth of damage (${{Inflation|US-CAP|6|1886}} million in {{Inflation-year|US-CAP}} dollars), at a time when all the city's buildings were valued around  $24 million (${{Inflation|US-CAP|24|1886}} million in {{Inflation-year|US-CAP}} dollars).

Investment in the city continued. The [[William Enston Home]], a planned community for the city's aged and infirm, was built in 1889. An elaborate public building, the United States Post Office and Courthouse, was completed by the federal government in 1896 in the heart of the city. The Democrat-dominated state legislature passed a new constitution in 1895 that [[Disfranchisement after Reconstruction era|disfranchised blacks]], effectively excluding them entirely from the political process, a second-class status that was maintained for more than six decades in a state that was majority-black until about 1930.

Charleston's tourism boom began in earnest following the publication of [[Albert Simons]] and [[Samuel Lapham VI|Samuel Lapham]]'s ''Architecture of Charleston''<ref>{{citation |last=Simons |first=Albert |last2=Lapham |first2=Samuel VI |ref={{harvid|Simons & al.|1927}} |publisher=Press of the American Institute of Architects |title=Charleston, S.C. |series=The Octagon ''Library of Early American Architecture'', Vol. I |date=1927}}.</ref> in the 1920s.<ref>{{citation |last=Horton |first=Tom |title=History's Lost Moments, ''Vol. V'' |p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=thPUBAAAQBAJ&pg=PA182 182] |date=2014 |publisher=Trafford |location= |contribution=Touring Charleston Back in 1912}}</ref>

Charleston languished economically for several decades in the 20th century, though the large federal military presence in the region helped to shore up the city's economy.

The Charleston Hospital Strike of 1969, in which mostly black workers protested discrimination and low wages, was one of the last major events of the [[civil rights movement]]. It attracted [[Ralph Abernathy]], [[Coretta Scott King]], [[Andrew Young]], and other prominent figures to march with the local leader, Mary Moultrie. Its story is recounted in [[Tom Dent]]'s book ''Southern Journey'' (1996).

[[Joseph P. Riley Jr.]] was elected mayor in the 1970s, and helped advance several cultural aspects of the city. Riley worked to revive Charleston's economic and cultural heritage. The last 30 years of the 20th century had major new investments in the city, with a number of municipal improvements and a commitment to historic preservation to restore the city's unique fabric. There was an effort to preserve working-class housing of African Americans on the historic peninsula, but the neighborhood has gentrified, with rising prices and rents. From 1980 to 2010, the peninsula's population has shifted from two-thirds black to two-thirds white; in 2010 residents numbered 20,668 whites to 10,455 blacks.<ref name="slade">[http://www.postandcourier.com/news/racial-shift-charleston-peninsula-s-makeup-reverses-in-years-with/article_69581977-ef00-5f6c-b969-edb7104344bb.html David Slade, "RACIAL SHIFT: Charleston peninsula's makeup reverses in 30 years, with blacks leaving for suburbs, area becoming two-thirds white"], ''The Post and Courier'', 28 March 2011; accessed 10 November 2016</ref> Many African Americans have moved to the less-expensive suburbs in these decades.<ref name="slade"/>

The city's commitments to investment were not slowed down by Hurricane Hugo and continue to this day. The eye of Hurricane Hugo came ashore at Charleston Harbor in 1989, and though the worst damage was in nearby [[McClellanville, South Carolina|McClellanville]], three-quarters of the homes in Charleston's historic district sustained damage of varying degrees. The hurricane caused over $2.8 billion in damage. The city was able to rebound fairly quickly after the hurricane and has grown in population, reaching an estimated 124,593 residents in 2009.<ref name="charlestoncity.info">{{cite web|url=http://www.charlestoncity.info/shared/docs/0/2010_population_estimates.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721192558/http://www.charlestoncity.info/shared/docs/0/2010_population_estimates.pdf|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2011-07-21|title=Century V City of Charleston Population 2010 Estimates|format=PDF}}</ref>

In 1993, the city was further impacted economically by the end of the [[Cold War]] when a decision of the [[Base Realignment and Closure Commission]] (BRAC) directed that '''[[Charleston Naval Shipyard|Naval Base Charleston]]''' be closed and that its surface ships and nuclear-powered submarines be relocated to other homeports, primarily [[Naval Station Norfolk]], Virginia and [[Naval Station Mayport]], Florida.  Pursuant to BRAC action, Naval Base Charleston was closed on April 1, 1996, although some activities remain under the cognizance of [[Naval Support Activity Charleston]], now part of [[Joint Base Charleston]].<ref>|http://www.northcharleston.org/Visitors/Attractions/Greater-Charleston-Naval-Base-Memorial/Naval-Base-History.aspx</ref>

Given Charleston's high concentration of African Americans who spoke the [[Gullah language]], a [[creole language]] that developed on the Sea Islands and in the Low Country, the local speech patterns were also influenced by this community. Today, Gullah is still spoken by many African American residents.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}} However, rapid development since 1980, especially on the surrounding Sea Islands, has attracted residents from outside the area and led to a decline in Gullah's prominence.

The traditional educated Charleston accent has long been noted in the state and throughout the South. It is typically heard in wealthy white families who trace their families back generations in the city. It has ingliding or monophthongal long mid-vowels, raises ''ay'' and ''aw'' in certain environments, and is [[rhotic and non-rhotic accents|nonrhotic]]. [[Sylvester Primer]] of the [[College of Charleston]] wrote about aspects of the local dialect in his late 19th-century works: "Charleston Provincialisms" (1887) <ref name="primer">[https://archive.org/details/jstor-456019 "Charleston Provincialisms" (1887)], Pub. Modern Language Association of America, Vol. iii, Internet Archive and Early Journal Content on JSTOR, accessed 5 November 2014</ref> and "The Huguenot Element in Charleston's Provincialisms", published in a German journal. He believed the accent was based on the English as it was spoken by the earliest settlers, therefore derived from Elizabethan England and preserved with modifications by Charleston speakers. The rapidly disappearing "Charleston accent" is still noted in the local pronunciation of the city's name. Many Charleston natives ignore the 'r' and elongate the first vowel, pronouncing the name as "Chah-l-ston".

===Religion===
Charleston is known as "The Holy City." Despite beliefs that the term dates to the city's earliest days and refers to its religiously tolerant culture, the term was coined in the 20th century, likely as a mockery of Charlestonians' self-satisfied attitude about their city.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Gilbreth |first1=Edward M. |title=Research says ‘Holy City’ term not church-based |work=Post and Courier |date=May 25, 2016 |location=Charleston, South Carolina}}</ref> Regardless of the nickname's origination, residents have embraced the term and explained it in more flattering terms.

The Anglican church was dominant in the colonial era, and the [[Cathedral of St. Luke and St. Paul (Charleston, South Carolina)|Cathedral of St. Luke and St. Paul]] is today the seat of the [[Diocese of South Carolina]].  Many French Huguenot refugees settled in Charleston in the early 18th century.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.huguenotsociety.org/history.htm|title=History of the Huguenot Society|publisher=Huguenotsociety.org|accessdate=2014-09-17|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20000830073605/http://www.huguenotsociety.org/history.htm|archivedate=August 30, 2000|df=mdy-all}}</ref>  The Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church is the oldest [[African Methodist Episcopal]] church in the Southern [[United States]] and houses the oldest [[black church|black congregation]] south of [[Baltimore, Maryland]].<ref name="NYTimes-MotherEmanuel-2015">{{cite news|last1=Weisman|first1=Jonathan|title=Killings Add a Painful Chapter to Storied History of Charleston Church|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/19/us/charleston-killings-evoke-history-of-violence-against-black-churches.html|accessdate=June 18, 2015|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=June 18, 2015}}</ref>

South Carolina has long allowed [[Jews]] to practice their faith without restriction. [[Congregation Kahal Kadosh Beth Elohim|Kahal Kadosh Beth Elohim]], founded in 1749 by [[Sephardic Jews]] from London, is the fourth-oldest Jewish congregation in the continental United States and was an important site for the development of [[Reform Judaism]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kkbe.org/|title=Kahal Kadosh Beth Elohim|publisher=Kkbe.org|accessdate=2014-09-17}}</ref> Brith Sholom Beth Israel is the oldest [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox]] synagogue in the South, founded by Sam Berlin and other [[Ashkenazi]] German and Central European Jews in the mid-19th century.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bsbisynagogue.com/|title=Brith Sholom Beth Israel|publisher=Bsbisynagogue.com|accessdate=2014-09-17}}</ref>

The city's oldest Roman Catholic parish, [[St. Mary's Roman Catholic Church (Charleston, South Carolina)|Saint Mary of the Annunciation Roman Catholic Church]], is the mother church of Roman Catholicism in North Carolina, South Carolina, and Georgia. In 1820, Charleston was established as the [[Episcopal see|see city]] of the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Charleston]], which at the time comprised the Carolinas and Georgia, and presently encompasses the state of South Carolina.

==Culture==
Charleston is known for its unique culture, which blends traditional Southern U.S., English, French, and West African elements. The downtown peninsula has gained a reputation for its art, music, local cuisine, and fashion. [[Spoleto Festival USA]], held annually in late spring, has become one of the world's major performing arts festivals. It was founded in 1977 by [[Pulitzer Prize]]-winning composer [[Gian Carlo Menotti]], who sought to establish a counterpart to the ''Festival dei Due Mondi'' (the Festival of Two Worlds) in [[Spoleto]], [[Italy]].

Charleston's oldest community theater group, the Footlight Players, has provided theatrical productions since 1931. A variety of performing arts venues includes the historic [[Dock Street Theatre]]. The annual Charleston Fashion Week held each spring in Marion Square brings in designers, journalists, and clients from across the nation. Charleston is known for its local seafood, which plays a key role in the city's renowned cuisine, comprising staple dishes such as [[gumbo]], she-crab soup, fried oysters, Lowcountry boil, deviled crab cakes, red rice, and shrimp and grits. Rice is the staple in many dishes, reflecting the rice culture of the Low Country. The cuisine in Charleston is also strongly influenced by British and French elements.

===Annual cultural events and fairs===
Charleston annually hosts [[Spoleto Festival USA]] founded by Gian Carlo Menotti, a 17-day art festival featuring over 100 performances by individual artists in a variety of disciplines. The Spoleto Festival is internationally recognized as America's premier performing arts festival.<ref name="charlestonspoleto.org">[http://www.charlestonspoleto.org/charleston-spoleto-festivals.html ]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120314202110/http://www.charlestonspoleto.org/charleston-spoleto-festivals.html |date=March 14, 2012 }}</ref> The annual Piccolo Spoleto festival takes place at the same time and features local performers and artists, with hundreds of performances throughout the city.

===Music===
{{main|Music in Charleston}}

As it has on every aspect of Charleston culture, the [[Gullah]] community has had a tremendous influence on music in Charleston, especially when it comes to the early development of [[jazz]] music. In turn, the music of Charleston has had an influence on that of the rest of the country. The [[geechee]] dances that accompanied the music of the dock workers in Charleston followed a rhythm that inspired [[Eubie Blake]]'s "Charleston Rag" and later [[James P. Johnson]]'s "[[Charleston (song)|Charleston]]", as well as the [[Charleston (dance)|dance craze]] that defined a nation in the 1920s. "[[Ballin' the Jack]]", which was a popular dance in the years before "Charleston", was written by native Charlestonian [[Chris Smith (composer)|Chris Smith]].<ref>{{cite book|author=Jack McCray|title=Charleston Jazz|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5hsWQcCvUTkC&pg=PA25|date=June 6, 2007|publisher=Arcadia Publishing|isbn=978-0-7385-4350-5|pages=11, 12}}</ref>

The [[Jenkins Orphanage]] was established in 1891 by the Rev. Daniel J. Jenkins in Charleston. The orphanage accepted donations of musical instruments and Rev. Jenkins hired local Charleston musicians and Avery Institute Graduates to tutor the boys in music. As a result, Charleston musicians became proficient on a variety of instruments and were able to read music expertly.<ref>{{cite book|author=Jack McCray|title=Charleston Jazz|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5hsWQcCvUTkC&pg=PA25|date=June 6, 2007|publisher=Arcadia Publishing|isbn=978-0-7385-4350-5|page=27}}</ref> These traits set Jenkins musicians apart and helped land some of them positions in big bands with Duke Ellington and Count Basie. [[Cat Anderson|William "Cat" Anderson]], [[Jabbo Smith]], and [[Freddie Green]] are but a few of the alumni from the Jenkins Orphanage band who became professional musicians in some of the best bands of the day. Orphanages around the country began to develop brass bands in the wake of the Jenkins Orphanage Band's success. At the Colored Waif's Home Brass Band in New Orleans, for example, a young trumpeter named [[Louis Armstrong]] first began to draw attention.<ref name="Hubbert">{{cite web|last=Hubbert|first=Julie|title=Jenkins Orphanage|url= http://www.sc.edu/orphanfilm/orphanage/symposia/scholarship/hubbert/jenkins-orphanage.html/|accessdate=2013-02-18}}</ref>

As many as five bands were on tour during the 1920s. The Jenkins Orphanage Band played in the inaugural parades of Presidents [[Theodore Roosevelt]] and [[William Howard Taft|William Taft]] and toured the US and Europe.<ref>Edgar, Walter. ''South Carolina Encyclopedia'' (2006) pp. 590–591, {{ISBN|1-57003-598-9}}</ref> The band also played on Broadway for the play "Porgy" by [[DuBose Heyward|DuBose]] and [[Dorothy Heyward]], a stage version of their novel of the same title. The story was based in Charleston and featured the Gullah community. The Heywards insisted on hiring the real Jenkins Orphanage Band to portray themselves on stage.<ref name="Hubbert"/> Only a few years later, DuBose Heyward collaborated with [[George Gershwin|George]] and [[Ira Gershwin]] to turn his novel into the now famous opera, ''[[Porgy and Bess]]'' (so named so as to distinguish it from the play). George Gershwin and Heyward spent the summer of 1934 at [[Folly Beach]] outside of Charleston writing this "folk opera", as Gershwin called it. ''Porgy and Bess'' is considered the Great American Opera{{citation needed|date=July 2015}} and is widely performed.<ref>{{cite web|last=Erb|first=Jane|title=Porgy and Bess (1934)|url=http://www.classical.net/music/comp.lst/works/gershwin/porgy&bess.php |accessdate=2013-02-19}}</ref>

To this day, Charleston is home to many musicians in all genres. A unique showcase of Charleston's musical heritage is presented weekly. "The Sound of Charleston....from gospel to Gershwin", is staged at the historic Circular Congregational Church.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.soundofcharleston.com|title=Welcome – The Sound Of Charleston|work=soundofcharleston|accessdate=September 17, 2014}}</ref>

The [[Music Farm (music venue)|Music Farm]] concert venue opened in Charleston on Ann Street in 1991.

==Armed Forces==
Charleston, North Charleston, Goose Creek, and Hanahan are home to branches of the United States military. During the Cold War, the [[Charleston Naval Shipyard|Naval Base]] (1902–1996) became the third largest U.S. homeport, with 23,500 Navy and Marine personnel, and 13,200 civilians serving over 80 ships and submarines. In addition, the combined facilities of the Naval Base and Weapons Station created the largest U.S. submarine port.  The [[Charleston Naval Shipyard]] repaired frigates, destroyers, cruisers, submarine tenders, and submarines. Also during this period, the shipyard conducted refueling of nuclear submarines.

The Weapons Station was the Atlantic Fleet's loadout base for all nuclear [[ballistic missile submarine]]s. Two SSBN "Boomer" squadrons and a submarine tender were homeported at the Weapons Station, while one SSN attack squadron, [[Submarine Squadron 4]], and a submarine tender were homeported at the Naval Base. At the 1996 closure of the station's Polaris Missile Facility Atlantic (POMFLANT), over 2,500 nuclear warheads and their [[UGM-27 Polaris]], [[UGM-73 Poseidon]], and [[UGM-96 Trident I]] delivery missiles ([[SLBM]]) were stored and maintained, guarded by a U.S. Marine Corps security force company.

In 2010, the Air Force base (3,877 acres) and Naval Weapons Station (>17,000 acres) merged to form [[Joint Base Charleston]]. Today, Joint Base Charleston, supporting 53 military commands and federal agencies, provides service to over 79,000 airmen, sailors, soldiers, Marines, [[United States Coast Guard#Creed of the United States Coast Guardsman|coast guardsmen]], Department of Defense civilians, dependents, and retirees.

==Sister cities==
Charleston has one official sister city, [[Spoleto]], Umbria, Italy.<ref>[http://www.charlestonspoleto.org/] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150801100217/http://www.charlestonspoleto.org/ |date=August 1, 2015 }}</ref> The relationship between the two cities began when Pulitzer Prize-winning Italian composer [[Gian Carlo Menotti]] selected Charleston as the city to host the American version of Spoleto's annual Festival of Two Worlds. "Looking for a city that would provide the charm of Spoleto, as well as its wealth of theaters, churches, and other performance spaces, they selected Charleston, South Carolina, as the ideal location. The historic city provided a perfect fit: intimate enough that the Festival would captivate the entire city, yet cosmopolitan enough to provide an enthusiastic audience and robust infrastructure."<ref name="charlestonspoleto.org"/>

Charleston is also twinned with [[Speightstown]], [[Saint Peter, Barbados|St. Peter]], Barbados.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tourism.gov.bb/cultural-heritage-programme.html|title=Cultural Heritage Programme – The Barbados Carolina Connection|publisher=Tourism.gov.bb|accessdate=September 17, 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140715101957/http://www.tourism.gov.bb/cultural-heritage-programme.html|archivedate=July 15, 2014|df=mdy-all}}</ref> Early English settlers here designed the original parts of Charlestown based on the plans of Barbados's capital city [[Bridgetown]].<ref>[http://www.discoversouthcarolina.com/files/pdfs/African%20American/SC-Barbados-connection.pdf]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130524181026/http://www.discoversouthcarolina.com/files/pdfs/African%20American/SC-Barbados-connection.pdf |date=May 24, 2013 }}</ref> Many indigo, tobacco, and cotton planters relocated their slaves and plantation operations from Speightstown to Charleston after the sugarcane industry came to dominate agricultural production in Barbados.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sciway.net/sn/43.html|title=Barbados: South Carolina's Mother Colony|publisher=Sciway.net|accessdate=September 17, 2014}}</ref>
