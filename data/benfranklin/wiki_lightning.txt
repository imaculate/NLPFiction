'''Lightning''' is a sudden [[electrostatic discharge]] that occurs typically during a [[thunderstorm]].  This discharge occurs between [[electric charge|electrically charged]] regions of a [[thundercloud|cloud]] (called intra-cloud lightning or IC), between two clouds (CC lightning), or between a cloud and the ground (CG lightning).

The charged regions in the atmosphere temporarily equalize themselves through this discharge referred to as a '''flash'''. A lightning flash can also be a [[Lightning strike|''strike'']] if it involves an object on the ground. Lightning creates light in the form of [[black body radiation]] from the very hot [[Plasma (physics)|plasma]] created by the electron flow, and sound in the form of  [[#Thunder|thunder]]. Lightning may be seen and not heard when it occurs at a distance too great for the sound to carry as far as the light from the strike or flash.

[[File:Understanding Lightning - Figure 1 - Cloud Charging Area.gif|thumb|The main charging area in a thunderstorm occurs in the central part of the storm where air is moving upward rapidly (updraft) and temperatures range from {{convert|-15|to|-25|C|F}}]]
The details of the charging process are still being studied by scientists, but there is general agreement on some of the basic concepts of thunderstorm electrification. The main charging area in a thunderstorm occurs in the central part of the storm where air is moving upward rapidly (updraft) and temperatures range from {{convert|-15|to|-25|C|F}}, see figure to the right. At that place, the combination of temperature and rapid upward air movement produces a mixture of super-cooled cloud droplets (small water droplets below freezing), small ice crystals, and [[graupel]] (soft hail). The updraft carries the super-cooled cloud droplets and very small ice crystals upward. At the same time, the graupel, which is considerably larger and denser, tends to fall or be suspended in the rising air.<ref name="NOAA">{{cite web|url=http://www.lightningsafety.noaa.gov/science/science_electrication.htm|title=NWS Lightning Safety: Understanding Lightning: Thunderstorm Electrification|publisher=[[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]]|accessdate=25 November 2016|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161130080723/http://www.lightningsafety.noaa.gov/science/science_electrication.htm|archivedate=November 30, 2016|df=mdy-all}} {{PD-notice}}</ref>

[[File:Graupel animation 3a.gif|thumb|left|When the rising ice crystals collide with graupel, the ice crystals become positively charged and the graupel becomes negatively charged.]]

The differences in the movement of the precipitation cause collisions to occur. When the rising ice crystals collide with graupel, the ice crystals become positively charged and the graupel becomes negatively charged.  See figure to the left. The updraft carries the positively charged ice crystals upward toward the top of the storm cloud. The larger and denser graupel is either suspended in the middle of the thunderstorm cloud or falls toward the lower part of the storm.<ref name="NOAA"/>
[[File:Charged cloud animation 4a.gif|thumb|The upper part of the thunderstorm cloud becomes positively charged while the middle to lower part of the thunderstorm cloud becomes negatively charged.]]
The result is that the upper part of the thunderstorm cloud becomes positively charged while the middle to lower part of the thunderstorm cloud becomes negatively charged.<ref name="NOAA"/>

The upward motions within the storm and winds at higher levels in the atmosphere tend to cause the small ice crystals (and positive charge) in the upper part of the thunderstorm cloud to spread out horizontally some distance from thunderstorm cloud base. This part of the thunderstorm cloud is called the anvil. While this is the main charging process for the thunderstorm cloud, some of these charges can be redistributed by air movements within the storm (updrafts and downdrafts). In addition, there is a small but important positive charge buildup near the bottom of the thunderstorm cloud due to the precipitation and warmer temperatures.<ref name="NOAA"/>

==General considerations==
[[File:LightningCNP.ogg|thumb|left|Four-second video of a lightning strike, Island in the Sky, [[Canyonlands National Park]], [[Utah]], United States.]]

On Earth, the lightning frequency is approximately 44 (± 5) times per second, or nearly 1.4 [[1,000,000,000 (number)|billion]] flashes per year<ref name="EncyWorldClim freq">{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=-mwbAsxpRr0C&pg=PA452|title=Encyclopedia of World Climatology|accessdate=February 8, 2009|publisher=[[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]]|author=Oliver, John E.| isbn=978-1-4020-3264-6|date=2005}}</ref> and the average duration is 0.2 seconds made up from a number of much shorter flashes (strokes) of around 60 to 70 [[microsecond]]s.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/electric/lightning2.html|title=Lightning|work=gsu.edu|accessdate=December 30, 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160115043319/http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/electric/lightning2.html|archivedate=January 15, 2016|df=mdy-all}}</ref>

Many factors affect the frequency, distribution, strength and physical properties of a typical lightning flash in a particular region of the world. These factors include ground elevation, [[latitude]], [[prevailing wind]] currents, [[relative humidity]], proximity to warm and cold bodies of water, etc. To a certain degree, the ratio between IC (in-cloud or intracloud), CC (cloud-to-cloud) and CG (cloud-to-ground) lightning may also vary by [[season]] in [[middle latitudes]].
Because human beings are terrestrial and most of their possessions are on the Earth where lightning can damage or destroy them, CG lightning is the most studied and best understood of the three types, even though IC and CC are more common types of lightning. Lightning's relative unpredictability limits a complete explanation of how or why it occurs, even after hundreds of years of scientific investigation.

A typical cloud-to-ground lightning flash culminates in the formation of an electrically conducting [[plasma (physics)|plasma]] channel through the air in excess of {{convert|5|km|mi|abbr=on}} tall, from within the cloud to the ground's surface. The actual discharge is the final stage of a very complex process.<ref>[[#Uman|Uman (1986)]] p. 81.</ref> At its peak, a typical [[thunderstorm]] produces three or more ''strikes'' to the Earth per minute.<ref>[[#Uman|Uman (1986)]] p. 55.</ref> Lightning primarily occurs when warm air is mixed with colder air masses,<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=g1foWWN5odwC&pg=PA90&dq=Lightning+occurs+when+warm+air+is+mixed+with+colder+air+masses#v=onepage&q=Lightning%20occurs%20when%20warm%20air%20is%20mixed%20with%20colder%20air%20masses&f=false|title=Sprites, Elves and Intense Lightning Discharges|last=Füllekrug|first=Martin|last2=Mareev|first2=Eugene A.|last3=Rycroft|first3=Michael J.|date=2006-05-01|publisher=Springer Science & Business Media|isbn=9781402046285|language=en|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171104190958/https://books.google.com/books?id=g1foWWN5odwC&pg=PA90&dq=Lightning+occurs+when+warm+air+is+mixed+with+colder+air+masses&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiV44XT9uXUAhVJ7mMKHb3pBUoQ6AEIMDAC#v=onepage&q=Lightning%20occurs%20when%20warm%20air%20is%20mixed%20with%20colder%20air%20masses&f=false|archivedate=November 4, 2017|df=mdy-all}}</ref> resulting in atmospheric disturbances necessary for polarizing the atmosphere.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}} However, it can also occur during [[dust storm]]s, [[forest fires]], [[tornado]]es, [[volcano|volcanic eruptions]], and even in the cold of [[winter]], where the lightning is known as [[thundersnow]].<ref>[http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2010/02/100203-volcanoes-lightning/ New Lightning Type Found Over Volcano?] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100209015048/http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2010/02/100203-volcanoes-lightning/ |date=February 9, 2010 }}.

The science of lightning is called ''fulminology'', and the fear of lightning is called ''[[astraphobia]]''.

==Frequency==
{{main|Distribution of lightning}}
[[File:Global lightning strikes.png|thumb|300px|World map showing frequency of lightning strikes, in flashes per km² per year (equal-area projection), from combined 1995–2003 data from the Optical Transient Detector and 1998–2003 data from the Lightning Imaging Sensor.]]

Lightning is not distributed evenly around the planet, as shown in the map.

About 70% of lightning occurs over land in the [[tropics]]<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=5oZUAAAAMAAJ&q=70%25+of+lightning+occurs+in+tropics+on+land&dq=70%25+of+lightning+occurs+in+tropics+on+land|title=Encyclopedia of atmospheric sciences|last=Holton|first=James R.|last2=Curry|first2=Judith A.|last3=Pyle|first3=J.

This occurs from both the mixture of warmer and colder [[air mass]]es, as well as differences in moisture concentrations, and it generally happens at the [[Weather front|boundaries between them]]. The flow of warm ocean currents past drier land masses, such as the [[Gulf stream|Gulf Stream]], partially explains the elevated frequency of lightning in the [[Southeast United States]]. Because the influence of small or absent land masses in the vast stretches of the world's oceans limits the differences between these variants in the atmosphere, lightning is notably less frequent there than over larger landforms. The [[north pole|North]] and [[south pole|South Poles]] are limited in their coverage of thunderstorms and therefore result in areas with the least amount of lightning.

In general, cloud-to-ground (CG) lightning flashes account for only 25% of all total lightning flashes worldwide. Since the base of a thunderstorm is usually negatively charged, this is where most CG lightning originates. This region is typically at the elevation where [[freezing level|freezing]] occurs within the cloud. Freezing, combined with collisions between ice and water, appears to be a critical part of the initial charge development and separation process. During wind-driven collisions, ice crystals tend to develop a positive charge, while a heavier, slushy mixture of ice and water (called [[graupel]]) develops a negative charge. Updrafts within a storm cloud separate the lighter ice crystals from the heavier graupel, causing the top region of the cloud to accumulate a positive [[space charge]] while the lower level accumulates a negative space charge.

[[File:2013-08-07 04-23-26-foudre-belfort.jpg|thumb|Lightning in [[Belfort]], [[France]]]]

Because the concentrated charge within the cloud must exceed the insulating properties of air, and this increases proportionally to the distance between the cloud and the ground, the proportion of CG strikes (versus cloud-to-cloud (CC) or in-cloud (IC) discharges) becomes greater when the cloud is closer to the ground. In the tropics, where the freezing level is generally higher in the atmosphere, only 10% of lightning flashes are CG. At the latitude of Norway (around 60° North latitude), where the freezing elevation is lower, 50% of lightning is CG.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://science.nasa.gov/science-news/science-at-nasa/2001/ast05dec_1/|date=December 5, 2001|title=Where LightningStrikes|publisher=NASA Science.

== Necessary conditions ==
{{main|Thunderstorm}}
[[File:Thunder.ogg|thumb|left|Sound of a thunderstorm]]
In order for an [[electrostatic discharge]] to occur, two preconditions are necessary: firstly, a sufficiently high [[electric potential]] between two regions of space must exist, and secondly, a high-resistance medium must obstruct the free, unimpeded equalization of the opposite charges.

It is well understood that during a thunderstorm there is charge separation and aggregation in certain regions of the cloud; however the exact processes by which this occurs are not fully understood.<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1175/1520-0450(1993)032<0642:AROTEP>2.0.CO;2|volume=32|title=A Review of Thunderstorm Electrification Processes |last1=Saunders|first1=C. P. R.|journal=Journal of Applied Meteorology |issue=4 |pages=642–55|bibcode=1993JApMe..32..642S |year=1993}}</ref>

The atmosphere provides the electrical insulation, or barrier, that prevents free equalization between charged regions of opposite polarity. This is overcome by "lightning", a complex process referred to as the lightning "flash".

===Electrical field generation===
[[File:LightningAboveCloudsView.JPG|thumb|View of lightning from an airplane flying above a system.]]

As a [[Cumulonimbus cloud|thundercloud]] moves over the surface of the Earth, an equal [[electric charge]], but of opposite polarity, is [[Electrostatic induction|induced]] on the Earth's surface underneath the cloud. The induced positive surface charge, when measured against a fixed point, will be small as the thundercloud approaches, increasing as the center of the storm arrives and dropping as the thundercloud passes. The referential value of the induced surface charge could be roughly represented as a bell curve.

The oppositely charged regions create an [[electric field]] within the air between them. This electric field varies in relation to the strength of the surface charge on the base of the thundercloud – the greater the accumulated charge, the higher the electrical field.

== Flashes and strikes ==
The best studied and understood form of lightning is cloud to ground (CG). Although more common, intracloud (IC) and cloud to cloud (CC) flashes are very difficult to study given there are no "physical" points to monitor inside the clouds. Also, given the very low probability lightning will strike the same point repeatedly and consistently, scientific inquiry is difficult at best even in the areas of high CG frequency. As such, knowing flash propagation is similar amongst all forms of lightning, the best means to describe the process is through an examination of the most studied form, cloud to ground.[[File:Desert Electric.jpg|thumb|right|250px|A lightning strike from '''cloud to ground''' in the California, [[Mojave Desert]]]] 
[[File:Florescent cloud blanket.jpg|thumb|right|260px|An '''intracloud''' flash. A lightning flash within the cloud, illuminates the entire blanket.]]

=== Lightning leaders ===
[[File:Lightning formation.gif|thumb|Lightning formation|thumb|A downward leader travels towards earth, branching as it goes.]]
[[File:Leaderlightnig.gif|thumbnail|Lightning strike caused by the connection of two leaders, positive shown in blue and negative in red]]

In a process not well understood, a bidirectional channel of [[ionized]] air, called a "[[leader (spark)|leader]]", is initiated between oppositely-charged regions in a thundercloud. Leaders are electrically conductive channels of ionized gas that propagate through, or are otherwise attracted to, regions with a charge opposite of that of the leader tip. The negative end of the bidirectional leader fills a positive charge region, also called a well, inside the cloud while the positive end fills a negative charge well. Leaders often split, forming branches in a tree-like pattern.<ref>Ultraslow-motion video of stepped leader propagation: [http://www.ztresearch.com/ ztresearch.com] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100413125231/http://www.ztresearch.com/ |date=April 13, 2010 }}</ref> In addition, negative and some positive leaders travel in a discontinuous fashion, in a process called "stepping". The resulting jerky movement of the leaders can be readily observed in slow-motion videos of lightning flashes.

It is possible for one end of the leader to fill the oppositely-charged well entirely while the other end is still active. When this happens, the leader end which filled the well may propagate outside of the thundercloud and result in either a cloud-to-air flash or a cloud-to-ground flash. In a typical cloud-to-ground flash, a bidirectional leader initiates between the main negative and lower positive charge regions in a thundercloud. The weaker positive charge region is filled quickly by the negative leader which then propagates toward the inductively-charged ground.

The positively and negatively charged leaders proceed in opposite directions, positive upwards within the cloud and [[Electric charge|negative]] towards the earth. Both ionic channels proceed, in their respective directions, in a number of successive spurts. Each leader "pools" ions at the leading tips, shooting out one or more new leaders, momentarily pooling again to concentrate charged ions, then shooting out another leader. The negative leader continues to propagate and split as it heads downward, often speeding up as it get closer to the Earth's surface.

About 90% of ionic channel lengths between "pools" are approximately {{convert|45|m|ft|abbr=on}} in length.<ref>Goulde, R.H. (1977) "The lightning conductor", pp. 545–576 in ''Lightning Protection'', R.H. Golde, Ed., ''Lightning, Vol. 2'', Academic Press.</ref> The establishment of the ionic channel takes a comparatively long amount of time (hundreds of [[millisecond]]s) in comparison to the resulting discharge, which occurs within a few dozen microseconds. The [[electric current]] needed to establish the channel, measured in the tens or hundreds of [[ampere]]s, is dwarfed by subsequent currents during the actual discharge.

Initiation of the lightning leaders is not well understood. The electric field strength within the thundercloud is not typically large enough to initiate this process by itself.<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1007/s11214-008-9338-z|title=Charge Structure and Dynamics in Thunderstorms|date=2008|last1=Stolzenburg|first1=Maribeth|last2=Marshall|first2=Thomas C.|journal=Space Science Reviews|volume=137|issue=1–4|page=355|bibcode = 2008SSRv..137..355S }}</ref> Many hypotheses have been proposed. One theory postulates that showers of relativistic electrons are created by [[cosmic rays]] and are then accelerated to higher velocities via a process called [[runaway breakdown]].

=== Upward streamers ===
When a stepped leader approaches the ground, the presence of opposite charges on the ground enhances the strength of the [[electric field]]. The electric field is strongest on grounded objects whose tops are closest to the base of the thundercloud, such as trees and tall buildings. If the electric field is strong enough, a positively charged ionic channel, called a positive or upward [[Streamer discharge|streamer]], can develop from these points. This was first theorized by Heinz Kasemir.<ref>Kasemir, H. W. (1950) "Qualitative Übersicht über Potential-, Feld- und Ladungsverhaltnisse bei einer Blitzentladung in der Gewitterwolke" (Qualitative survey of the potential, field and charge conditions during a lightning discharge in the thunderstorm cloud) in ''Das Gewitter'' (The Thunderstorm), H. Israel, ed., Leipzig, Germany: Akademische Verlagsgesellschaft.</ref><ref>Ruhnke, Lothar H. (June 7, 2007) [https://archive.is/20110611231459/http://www.physicstoday.org/obits/notice_157.shtml Death notice: Heinz Wolfram Kasemir]. physicstoday.org</ref>

As negatively charged leaders approach, increasing the localized electric field strength, grounded objects already experiencing [[corona discharge]] [[Electrical breakdown#Corona breakdown|exceed a threshold]] and form upward streamers.

=== Attachment ===
Once a downward leader connects to an available upward leader, a process referred to as attachment, a low-resistance path is formed and discharge may occur. Photographs have been taken in which unattached streamers are clearly visible. The unattached downward leaders are also visible in branched lightning, none of which are connected to the earth, although it may appear they are. High-speed videos can show the attachment process in progress. <ref>Saba, M. M. F., A. R. Paiva, C. Schumann, M. A. S. Ferro, K. P. Naccarato, J. C. O. Silva, F. V. C. Siqueira, and D. M. Custódio (2017), Lightning attachment process to common buildings, Geophys. Res. Lett., 44, doi:10.1002/2017GL072796</ref>

=== Discharge ===

====Return stroke====
[[File:Lightnings sequence 2 animation-wcag.gif|thumb|High-speed photography showing different parts of a lightning flash during the discharge process as seen in [[Toulouse]], [[France]].]]

Once a conductive channel bridges the air gap between the negative charge excess in the cloud and the positive surface charge excess below, there is a large drop in resistance across the lightning channel. Electrons accelerate rapidly as a result in a zone beginning at the point of attachment, which expands across the entire leader network at a fraction of the speed of light. This is the 'return stroke' and it is the most [[Luminous intensity|luminous]] and noticeable part of the lightning discharge.

A large electric current flows along the plasma channel from the cloud to the ground, neutralising the positive ground charge as electrons flow away from the strike point to the surrounding area. This huge surge of current creates large radial voltage differences along the surface of the ground. Called step potentials, they are responsible for more injuries and deaths than the strike itself.{{Citation needed|date=May 2013}} Electricity takes every path available to it.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Path of Least Resistance|url=http://ecmweb.com/content/path-least-resistance|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160104215214/http://ecmweb.com/content/path-least-resistance|archivedate=January 4, 2016|df=mdy-all|date=July 2001}}</ref>
A portion of the return stroke current will often preferentially flow through one leg and out another, electrocuting an unlucky human or animal standing near the point where the lightning strikes.

The electric current of the return stroke averages 30 kiloamperes for a typical negative CG flash, often referred to as "negative CG" lightning. In some cases, a ground to cloud (GC) lightning flash may originate from a positively charged region on the ground below a storm. These discharges normally originate from the tops of very tall structures, such as communications antennas. The rate at which the return stroke current travels has been found to be around 100,000 km/s.<ref>{{Cite journal | last1 = Idone | first1 = V. P. | last2 = Orville | first2 = R.

The massive flow of electric current occurring during the return stroke combined with the rate at which it occurs (measured in microseconds) rapidly [[superheating|superheats]] the completed leader channel, forming a highly electrically conductive plasma channel. The core temperature of the plasma during the return stroke may exceed 50,000 K, causing it to brilliantly radiate with a blue-white color. Once the electric current stops flowing, the channel cools and dissipates over tens or hundreds of milliseconds, often disappearing as fragmented patches of glowing gas. The nearly instantaneous heating during the return stroke causes the air to expand explosively, producing a powerful [[shock wave]] which is heard as [[#Thunder|thunder]].

====Re-strike====
High-speed videos (examined frame-by-frame) show that most negative CG lightning flashes are made up of 3 or 4 individual strokes, though there may be as many as 30.<ref>[[#Uman|Uman (1986)]] Ch. 5, p. 41.</ref>

Each re-strike is separated by a relatively large amount of time, typically 40 to 50 milliseconds, as other charged regions in the cloud are discharged in subsequent strokes. Re-strikes often cause a noticeable "[[strobe light]]" effect.<ref name="uman">[[#Uman|Uman (1986)]] pp. 103–110.</ref>

To understand why multiple return strokes utilize the same lightning channel, one needs to understand the behavior of positive leaders, which a typical ground flash effectively becomes following the negative leader's connection with the ground. Positive leaders decay more rapidly than negative leaders do. For reasons not well understood, bidirectional leaders tend to initiate on the tips of the decayed positive leaders in which the negative end attempts to re-ionize the leader network. These leaders, also called '''recoil leaders''', usually decay shortly after their formation. When they do manage to make contact with a conductive portion of the main leader network, a return stroke-like process occurs and a '''dart leader''' travels across all, or a portion of the length of the original leader. The dart leaders making connections with the ground is what causes a majority of subsequent return strokes.<ref name="Warner">{{cite web |url=https://ztresearch.blog/education/ground-flashes/ |title=Ground Flashes |last=Warner |first=Tom |website=ZT Research |access-date=2017-11-09|date=2017-05-06 }}</ref>

Each successive stroke is preceded by intermediate dart leader strokes that have a faster rise time but lower amplitude than the initial return stroke. Each subsequent stroke usually re-uses the discharge channel taken by the previous one, but the channel may be offset from its previous position as wind displaces the hot channel.<ref>[[#Uman|Uman (1986)]] Ch. 9, p. 78.</ref>

Since recoil and dart leader processes do not occur on negative leaders, subsequent return strokes very seldom utilize the same channel on positive ground flashes which are explained later in the article.<ref name="Warner"/>

====Transient currents during flash====
The electric current within a typical negative CG lightning discharge rises very quickly to its peak value in 1–10 microseconds, then decays more slowly over 50–200 microseconds. The transient nature of the current within a lightning flash results in several phenomena that need to be addressed in the effective protection of ground-based structures. Rapidly changing currents tend to travel on the surface of a conductor, in what is called the [[skin effect]], unlike direct currents, which "flow through" the entire conductor like water through a hose. Hence, conductors used in the protection of facilities tend to be multi-stranded, with small wires woven together. This increases the total bundle [[surface area]] in inverse proportion to the individual strand radius, for a fixed total [[Cross section (geometry)|cross-sectional area]].

The rapidly changing currents also create [[Electromagnetic pulse|electromagnetic pulses (EMPs)]] that radiate outward from the ionic channel. This is a characteristic of all electrical discharges. The radiated pulses rapidly weaken as their distance from the origin increases. However, if they pass over conductive elements such as power lines, communication lines, or metallic pipes, they may induce a current which travels outward to its termination. This is the "[[Voltage spike|surge]]" that, more often than not, results in the destruction of delicate [[electronics]], [[electrical appliance]]s, or [[electric motor]]s. Devices known as [[Surge protector|surge protectors (SPD) or transient voltage surge suppressors (TVSS)]] attached in parallel with these lines can detect the lightning flash's transient irregular current, and, through an alteration of its physical properties, route the spike to an attached [[Electrical ground|earthing ground]], thereby protecting the equipment from damage.

== Types ==
There are three primary types of lightning, defined by what is at the "ends" of a flash channel.
*Intracloud (IC), which occurs within a single thundercloud unit
*Cloud to cloud (CC) or intercloud, which starts and ends between two different "functional" thundercloud units
*Cloud to ground (CG), that primarily originates in the thundercloud and terminates on an Earth surface, but may also occur in the reverse direction, that is ground to cloud 
There are variations of each type, such as "positive" versus "negative" CG flashes, that have different physical characteristics common to each which can be measured. Different [[common name]]s used to describe a particular lightning event may be attributed to the same or different events.

=== Cloud to ground (CG) ===
[[File:Lightning strikes mountain top.jpg|thumb|right|''Cloud to ground'' lightning]]
Cloud-to-ground (CG) lightning is a lightning discharge between a thundercloud and the ground. It is initiated by a stepped leader moving down from the cloud, which is met by a streamer moving up from the ground.

CG is the least common, but best understood of all types of lightning.  It is easier to study scientifically, because it terminates on a physical object, namely the Earth, and lends itself to being measured by instruments on the ground. Of the three primary types of lightning, it poses the greatest threat to life and property since it terminates or "strikes" the Earth. 
The overall discharge, termed a flash, is composed of a number of processes such as preliminary breakdown, stepped leaders, connecting leaders, return strokes, dart leaders and subsequent return strokes.<ref>V. Cooray, Mechanism of the Lightning Flash, in: The Lightning Flash, 2nd ed., V. Cooray (Ed.), The Institution of Engineering and Technology, London, United Kingdom, 2014, pp. 119–229</ref>

===={{anchor|Positive lightning}}Positive and negative lightning====
Cloud-to-ground (CG) lightning is either positive or negative, as defined by the direction of the [[Electric current#Conventions|conventional electric current]] from cloud to ground.  Most CG lightning is negative, meaning that a negative charge is transferred to ground and electrons travel downward along the lightning channel. The reverse happens in a positive CG flash, where electrons travel upward along the lightning channel and a positive charge is transferred to the ground. Positive lightning is less common than negative lightning, and on average makes up less than 5% of all lightning strikes.<ref>{{cite web | title = NWS JetStream – The Positive and Negative Side of Lightning | publisher = [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]] | url = http://www.srh.noaa.gov/jetstream/lightning/positive.htm | accessdate = September 25, 2007 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070705205815/http://www.srh.noaa.gov/jetstream/lightning/positive.htm | archivedate = July 5, 2007 | df = mdy-all }}</ref>

There are six different mechanisms theorized to result in the formation of downward positive lightning.<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1029/2012JD017545|title=Positive lightning: An overview, new observations, and inferences|journal=Journal of Geophysical Research: Atmospheres|volume=117|issue=D8|pages=n/a|year=2012|last1=Nag|first1=Amitabh|last2=Rakov|first2=Vladimir A|bibcode=2012JGRD..117.8109N}}</ref>
* Vertical wind shear displacing the upper positive charge region of a thundercloud, exposing it to the ground below.
* The loss of lower charge regions in the dissipating stage of a thunderstorm, leaving the primary positive charge region.
* A complex arrangement of charge regions in a thundercloud, effectively resulting in an '''inverted dipole''' or '''inverted tripole''' in which the main negative charge region is above the main positive charge region instead of beneath it.
* An unusually large lower positive charge region in the thundercloud.
* Cutoff of an extended negative leader from its origin which creates a new bidirectional leader in which the positive end strikes the ground, commonly seen in anvil-crawler spider flashes.
* The initiation of a downward positive branch from an intracloud lightning flash.

Contrary to popular belief, positive lightning flashes do '''not''' necessarily originate from the anvil or the upper positive charge region and strike a rain-free area outside of the thunderstorm. This belief is based on the outdated idea that lightning leaders are unipolar in nature and originating from their respective charge region.

Positive lightning strikes tend to be much more intense than their negative counterparts. An average bolt of [[Electrical polarity|negative]] lightning carries an electric current of 30,000 [[ampere]]s (30 kA), and transfers 15 [[coulomb]]s of [[electric charge]] and 500 [[joule|megajoules]] of [[energy]]. Large bolts of negative lightning can carry up to 120 kA and 350 coulombs.<ref>Hasbrouck, Richard.

As a result of their greater power, as well as lack of warning, positive lightning strikes are considerably more dangerous. Due to the aforementioned tendency for positive ground flashes to produce both high peak currents and long continuing current, they are capable of heating surfaces to much higher levels which increases the likelihood of a fire being ignited.

Positive lightning has also been shown to trigger the occurrence of upward lightning flashes from the tops of tall structures and is largely responsible for the initiation of [[Upper-atmospheric lightning#Sprites|sprites]] several tens of kilometers above ground level. Positive lightning tends to occur more frequently in [[winter storm]]s, as with [[thundersnow]], during intense [[tornado]]es<ref name="Tornadic lightning">{{cite journal|author1=Antony H.

A unique form of cloud-to-ground lightning exists where lightning appears to exit from the cumulonimbus cloud and propagate a considerable distance through clear air before veering towards, and striking, the ground. For this reason, they are known as "bolts from the blue". Despite the popular misconception that these are positive lightning strikes due to them seemingly originating from the positive charge region, observations have shown that these are in fact negative flashes. They begin as intracloud flashes within the cloud, the negative leader then exits the cloud from the positive charge region before propagating through clear air and striking the ground some distance away.<ref name="ReferenceA">{{cite journal|doi=10.1029/2011JD016890|title=Lightning morphology and impulse charge moment change of high peak current negative strokes|journal=Journal of Geophysical Research: Atmospheres|volume=117|issue=D4|pages=n/a|year=2012|last1=Lu|first1=Gaopeng|last2=Cummer|first2=Steven A|last3=Blakeslee|first3=Richard J|last4=Weiss|first4=Stephanie|last5=Beasley|first5=William H|bibcode=2012JGRD..117.4212L|citeseerx=10.1.1.308.9842}}</ref><ref name="ReferenceB">{{cite journal|doi=10.1038/ngeo162|title=Upward electrical discharges from&nbsp;thunderstorms|journal=Nature Geoscience|volume=1|issue=4|pages=233|year=2008|last1=Krehbiel|first1=Paul R|last2=Riousset|first2=Jeremy A|last3=Pasko|first3=Victor P|last4=Thomas|first4=Ronald J|last5=Rison|first5=William|last6=Stanley|first6=Mark A|last7=Edens|first7=Harald E|bibcode=2008NatGe...1..233K}}</ref>

Lightning discharges may occur between areas of cloud without contacting the ground. When it occurs between two separate clouds it is known as ''inter-cloud lightning'', and when it occurs between areas of differing [[electric potential]] within a single cloud it is known as ''intra-cloud lightning''. Intra-cloud lightning is the most frequently occurring type.<ref name="GHCC primer2" />

Intra-cloud lightning most commonly occurs between the upper [[cumulonimbus incus|anvil]] portion and lower reaches of a given thunderstorm. This lightning can sometimes be observed at great distances at night as so-called "[[sheet lightning]]". In such instances, the observer may see only a flash of light without hearing any thunder.

Another term used for cloud–cloud or cloud–cloud–ground lightning is "Anvil Crawler", due to the habit of charge, typically originating beneath or within the anvil and scrambling through the upper cloud layers of a thunderstorm, often generating dramatic multiple branch strokes. These are usually seen as a thunderstorm passes over the observer or begins to decay. The most vivid crawler behavior occurs in well developed thunderstorms that feature extensive rear anvil shearing.

=== Observational variations ===
* '''Anvil crawler lightning''', sometimes called '''Spider lightning''' is created when leaders propagate through horizontally-extensive charge regions in mature thunderstorms, usually the stratiform regions of mesoscale convective systems. These discharges usually begin as intracloud discharges originating within the convective region; the negative leader end then propagates well into the aforementioned charge regions in the stratiform area. If the leader becomes too long, it may separate into multiple bidirectional leaders. When this happens, the positive end of the separated leader may strike the ground as a positive CG flash or crawl on the underside of the cloud, creating a spectacular display of lightning crawling across the sky. Ground flashes produced in this manner tend to transfer high amounts of charge, and this can trigger upward lightning flashes and upper-atmospheric lightning.<ref name="Warner"/>
* '''[[Ball lightning]]''' may be an [[atmospheric electricity|atmospheric electrical]] phenomenon, the physical nature of which is still [[controversial]]. The term refers to reports of [[luminosity|luminous]], usually [[spherical]] objects which vary from pea-sized to several meters in diameter.<ref>{{cite book | last = Singer | first = Stanley

'Bead lightning' is more properly a stage of a normal lightning discharge rather than a type of lightning in itself. Beading of a lightning channel is usually a small-scale feature, and therefore is often only apparent when the observer/camera is close to the lightning.<ref>{{cite web|last=Robinson|first=Dan|title=Weather Library: Lightning Types & Classifications|url=http://stormhighway.com/types.shtml|accessdate=March 17, 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130215041135/http://stormhighway.com/types.shtml|archivedate=February 15, 2013|df=mdy-all}}</ref>

It is theorized that severe thunderstorms in this region obtain an "inverted tripole" charge structure in which the main positive charge region is located below the main negative charge region instead of above it, and as a result these thunderstorms generate predominantly positive cloud-to-ground lightning. The term "smooth channel lightning" is also sometimes attributed to upward ground-to-cloud lightning flashes, which are generally negative flashes initiated by upward positive leaders from tall structures.

{{anchor|Sympathetic lightning}}
* '''Sympathetic lightning''' is the tendency of lightning to be loosely coordinated across long distances. Discharges can appear in clusters when viewed from space.
{{anchor|Clear-air lightning}}
* '''Upward lightning''' or '''ground-to-cloud lightning''' is a lightning flash which originates from the top of a grounded object and propagates upward from this point. This type of lightning can be triggered by a preceding lightning flash, or it may initiate entirely on its own. The former is generally found in regions where spider lightning occurs, and may involve multiple grounded objects simultaneously. <ref>Saba, M. M. F., C. Schumann, T. A. Warner, M. A. S. Ferro, A.

* '''Clear-air lightning''' describes lightning that occurs with no apparent cloud close enough to have produced it.

Also in areas such as [[Sound (geography)|sounds]], large lakes or open plains, when the storm cell is on the near horizon (within {{convert|26|km|mi|abbr=on}}) there may be some distant activity, a strike can occur and as the storm is so far away, the strike is referred to as '''a bolt from the blue'''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.discovery.com/earth/weather-extreme-events/lightning-on-clear-day-110729.htm|title=When Lightning Strikes Out of a Blue Sky|work=DNews|accessdate=October 15, 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151101020717/http://news.discovery.com/earth/weather-extreme-events/lightning-on-clear-day-110729.htm|archivedate=November 1, 2015|df=mdy-all}}</ref>  These flashes usually begin as normal intracloud lightning flashes before the negative leader exits the cloud and strikes the ground a considerable distance away.<ref name="ReferenceA"/><ref name="ReferenceB"/> Positive clear-air strikes can occur in highly sheared environments where the upper positive charge region becomes horizontally displaced from the precipitation area.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.crh.noaa.gov/gid/Web_Stories/2004/other/lightningsafety/intro/introduction.php | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20090514211951/http://www.crh.noaa.gov/gid/Web_Stories/2004/other/lightningsafety/intro/introduction.php | archivedate = May 14, 2009 | title = Bolt from the Blue | publisher = [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]] | accessdate = August 20, 2009 | last = Lawrence | first = D | date = November 1, 2005 }}</ref>

== Effects ==

=== Lightning strike ===
{{Main|Lightning strike}}

Objects struck by lightning experience heat and magnetic forces of great magnitude. The heat created by lightning currents traveling through a tree may vaporize its sap, causing a steam explosion that bursts the trunk. As lightning travels through sandy soil, the soil surrounding the [[plasma channel]] may melt, forming tubular structures called [[fulgurite]]s. Even though roughly 90 percent of people struck by lightning survive,<ref name="Outside 2014-09-22">{{cite web|url=http://www.outsideonline.com/outdoor-adventure/nature/The-Body-Electric.html|title=Lightning-Strike Survivors Tell Their Stories|last1=Jabr|first1=Ferris|date=22 September 2014|publisher=''[[Outside (magazine)|Outside]]''|accessdate=28 September 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140928220906/http://www.outsideonline.com/outdoor-adventure/nature/The-Body-Electric.html|archivedate=September 28, 2014|df=mdy-all}}</ref> humans or animals struck by lightning may suffer severe injury due to internal organ and nervous system damage. Buildings or tall structures hit by lightning may be damaged as the lightning seeks unintended paths to ground. By safely conducting a lightning strike to ground, a lightning protection system can greatly reduce the probability of severe property damage. Lightning also serves an important role in the [[nitrogen cycle]] by oxidizing diatomic nitrogen in the air into [[nitrates]] which are deposited by rain and can fertilize the growth of plants and other organisms.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Bond | first1 = D.W. | last2 = Steiger | first2 = S. | last3 = Zhang | first3 = R. | last4 = Tie | first4 = X. | last5 = Orville | first5 = R.E. | year = 2002 | title = The importance of NOx production by lightning in the tropics | url = | journal = Atmospheric Environment | volume = 36 | issue = 9| pages = 1509–1519 | doi=10.1016/s1352-2310(01)00553-2| bibcode = 2002AtmEn..36.1509B }}</ref><ref>Pickering, K.E., Bucsela, E., Allen, D, Cummings, K., Li, Y., MacGorman, D., Bruning, E. 2014.

=== Thunder ===
{{main|Thunder}}

Because the electrostatic discharge of terrestrial lightning superheats the air to plasma temperatures along the length of the discharge channel in a short duration, [[kinetic theory of gases|kinetic theory]] dictates gaseous molecules undergo a rapid increase in pressure and thus expand outward from the lightning creating a [[shock wave]] audible as thunder. Since the sound waves propagate not from a single point source but along the length of the lightning's path, the sound origin's varying distances from the observer can generate a rolling or rumbling effect. Perception of the sonic characteristics is further complicated by factors such as the irregular and possibly branching geometry of the lightning channel, by [[echo (phenomenon)|acoustic echoing]] from terrain, and by the typically multiple-stroke characteristic of the lightning strike.

[[Speed of light|Light travels]] at about 300,000,000&nbsp;m/s, and [[speed of sound|sound]] travels through air at about 343&nbsp;m/s. An observer can approximate the distance to the strike by timing the interval between the visible lightning and the audible thunder it generates. A lightning flash preceding its thunder by one second would be approximately {{convert|343|m|mi|abbr=on}} in distance; a delay of three seconds would indicate a distance of about {{convert|1|km|mi|sp=us|spell=in}} (3×343&nbsp;m). A flash preceding thunder by five seconds would indicate a distance of approximately {{convert|1|mi|km|spell=in}} (5×343&nbsp;m). Consequently, a lightning strike observed at a very close distance will be accompanied by a sudden clap of thunder, with almost no perceptible time lapse, possibly accompanied by the smell of [[ozone]] (O<sub>3</sub>).

Lightning at a sufficient distance may be seen and not heard; there is data that a lightning storm can be seen at over 100 miles whereas the thunder travels about 20 miles. Anecdotally, there are many examples of people saying 'the storm was directly overhead or all-around and yet there was no thunder'. There is no coherent data available.{{cn|date=May 2018}}

A number of observations by space-based telescopes have revealed even higher energy [[gamma ray]] emissions, the so-called [[terrestrial gamma-ray flash]]es (TGFs).

===Air quality===
The very high temperatures generated by lightning lead to significant local increases in [[ozone]] and [[NOx|oxides of Nitrogen]]. Each lightning flash in temperate and sub-tropical areas produces 7kg of NOx on average<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2009/10/091030100022.htm|title=Lightning's 'NOx-ious' Impact On Pollution, Climate|publisher= Science News|access-date=4 August 2018}}</ref>.

== Volcanic ==
[[File:Rinjani 1994.jpg|thumb|Volcanic material thrust high into the atmosphere can trigger lightning.]]

Volcanic activity produces lightning-friendly conditions in multiple ways. The enormous quantity of pulverized material and gases explosively ejected into the atmosphere creates a dense plume of particles. The ash density and constant motion within the volcanic plume produces charge by frictional interactions (triboelectrification), resulting in very powerful and very frequent flashes as the cloud attempts to neutralize itself. Due to the extensive solid material (ash) content, unlike the water rich charge generating zones of a normal thundercloud, it is often called a [[dirty thunderstorm]].

* Powerful and frequent flashes have been witnessed in the volcanic plume as far back as the 79 AD eruption of [[Vesuvius]] by [[Pliny The Younger]].<ref name="Volcano Lightning">{{cite web | url = http://www.mcli.dist.maricopa.edu/tut/final/pliny.html| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20030625075734/http://www.mcli.dist.maricopa.edu/tut/final/pliny.html| archivedate = June 25, 2003|title = Pliny the Younger's Observations|accessdate = July 5, 2007|author = Pliny the Younger|quote = Behind us were frightening dark clouds, rent by lightning twisted and hurled, opening to reveal huge figures of flame.}}</ref>
* Likewise, vapors and ash originating from vents on the volcano's flanks may produce more localized and smaller flashes upwards of 2.9&nbsp;km long.
* Small, short duration [[Electric spark|spark]]s, recently documented near newly extruded magma, attest to the material being highly charged prior to even entering the atmosphere.<ref>Dell'Amore, Christine (February 3, 2010) [http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2010/02/100203-volcanoes-lightning/?source=link_fb02102009 New Lightning Type Found Over Volcano?] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121020153656/http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2010/02/100203-volcanoes-lightning/?source=link_fb02102009 |date=October 20, 2012 }}.

== Extraterrestrial ==
Lightning has been observed within the [[Celestial body atmosphere|atmospheres]] of other [[planet]]s, such as [[Jupiter]] and [[Saturn]]. Although in the minority on Earth, superbolts appear to be common on Jupiter.

Lightning on Venus has been a controversial subject after decades of study. During the Soviet [[Venera]] and U.S. [[Pioneer program|Pioneer]] missions of the 1970s and 1980s, signals suggesting lightning may be present in the upper atmosphere were detected.<ref name="plasma">{{cite journal|url=http://www-ssc.igpp.ucla.edu/~strange/JATP_paper/JATP_title.html|title=Plasma Wave Evidence for Lightning on Venus|accessdate=September 24, 2007|journal=Journal of Atmospheric and Terrestrial Physics|volume=57|pages=537–556|date=1995|author=Strangeway, Robert J.|bibcode=1995JATP...57..537S|doi=10.1016/0021-9169(94)00080-8|issue=5|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071012160656/http://www-ssc.igpp.ucla.edu/~strange/JATP_paper/JATP_title.html|archivedate=October 12, 2007|df=mdy-all}}</ref> Although the [[Cassini–Huygens]] mission fly-by of Venus in 1999 detected no signs of lightning, the observation window lasted mere hours. Radio pulses recorded by the spacecraft [[Venus Express]] (which began orbiting Venus in April 2006) may originate from lightning on Venus.

* '''Airplane contrails''' have also been observed to influence lightning to a small degree. The water vapor-dense contrails of airplanes may provide a lower resistance pathway through the atmosphere having some influence upon the establishment of an ionic pathway for a lightning flash to follow.<ref>[[#Uman|Uman (1986)]] Ch. 4, pp. 26–34.</ref>

Lightning discharges generate a wide range of electromagnetic radiations, including radio-frequency pulses. The times at which a pulse from a given lightning discharge arrives at several receivers can be used to locate the source of the discharge. The United States federal government has constructed a nationwide grid of such lightning detectors, allowing lightning discharges to be tracked in real time throughout the continental U.S.<ref>{{cite web

The [[Earth-ionosphere waveguide]] traps electromagnetic [[VLF]]- and [[Extremely low frequency|ELF]] waves. Electromagnetic pulses transmitted by lightning strikes propagate within that waveguide. The waveguide is dispersive, which means that their [[group velocity]] depends on frequency. The difference of the group time delay of a lightning pulse at adjacent frequencies is proportional to the distance between transmitter and receiver. Together with direction finding methods, this allows locating lightning strikes up to distances of 10,000&nbsp;km from their origin. Moreover, the eigenfrequencies of the Earth-ionospheric waveguide, the [[Schumann resonances]]
at about 7.5&nbsp;Hz, are used to determine the global thunderstorm activity.<ref>Volland, H. (ed) (1995) ''Handbook of Atmospheric Electrodynamics'', CRC Press, Boca Raton, {{ISBN|0849386470}}.</ref>

=== Artificially triggered ===
* '''Rocket-triggered lightning''' can be "triggered" by launching [[lightning rocket|specially designed rockets]] trailing spools of wire into thunderstorms. The wire unwinds as the rocket ascends, creating an elevated ground that can attract descending leaders. If a leader attaches, the wire provides a low-resistance pathway for a lightning flash to occur. The wire is vaporized by the return current flow, creating a straight lightning plasma channel in its place. This method allows for scientific research of lightning to occur under a more controlled and predictable manner.<ref name="vid">{{cite web|url=http://skydiary.com/gallery/chase2002/2002lightmovie.html|title=Triggered lightning video|accessdate=September 24, 2007|publisher=Chris Kridler's Sky Diary|date=July 25, 2002|author=Kridler, Chris|work=requires QuickTime|format=video|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070915074527/http://skydiary.com/gallery/chase2002/2002lightmovie.html|archivedate=September 15, 2007|df=mdy-all}}</ref>

*:In New Mexico, U.S., scientists tested a new [[terawatt]] laser which provoked lightning. Scientists fired ultra-fast pulses from an extremely powerful laser thus sending several terawatts into the clouds to call down electrical discharges in storm clouds over the region. The laser beams sent from the laser make channels of ionized molecules known as "'''filaments'''". Before the lightning strikes earth, the filaments lead electricity through the clouds, playing the role of lightning rods. Researchers generated filaments that lived a period too short to trigger a real lightning strike. Nevertheless, a boost in electrical activity within the clouds was registered. According to the French and German scientists who ran the experiment, the fast pulses sent from the laser will be able to provoke lightning strikes on demand.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://infoniac.com/science/terawatt-laser-beam-shot-clouds-provokes-lightning-strike.html |title=Terawatt Laser Beam Shot in the Clouds Provokes Lightning Strike |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080420130439/http://infoniac.com/science/terawatt-laser-beam-shot-clouds-provokes-lightning-strike.html |archivedate=April 20, 2008 |df=mdy-all }} News report based on: {{Cite journal | doi = 10.1364/OE.16.005757| pmid = 18542684| title = Electric events synchronized with laser filaments in thunderclouds| journal = Optics Express| volume = 16| issue = 8| pages = 5757–63| year = 2008| last1 = Kasparian | first1 = J. | last2 = Ackermann | first2 = R. | last3 = André | first3 = Y.

==== Magnetism ====
The movement of electrical charges produces a magnetic field (see [[electromagnetism]]). The intense currents of a lightning discharge create a fleeting but very strong magnetic field. Where the lightning current path passes through rock, soil, or metal these materials can become permanently magnetized. This effect is known as lightning-induced [[Remanence|remanent]] magnetism, or LIRM. These currents follow the least resistive path, often horizontally near the surface<ref>{{cite journal|title=The Re-magnetization of a Surface Outcrop by Lightning Currents|doi=10.1111/j.1365-246X.1961.tb02963.x|date=1961|last1=Graham|first1=K.W.T.|journal=[[Geophysical Journal International]]|volume=6|issue=1|page=85|bibcode = 1961GeoJ....6...85G }}</ref><ref>Cox A.

[[File:Mikalojus Konstantinas Ciurlionis - LIGHTNING - 1909.jpg|thumb|Lightning by [[Mikalojus Konstantinas Ciurlionis]] (1909)]]

In many cultures, lightning has been viewed as part of a deity or a deity in and of itself. These include the [[Greek god]] [[Zeus]], the [[Aztec]] god [[Tlaloc]], the [[Maya religion|Mayan]] [[God K]], [[Slavic mythology]]'s [[Perun]], the [[Baltic languages|Baltic]] [[Pērkons]]/[[Perkūnas]], [[Thor]] in [[Norse mythology]], [[Ukko]] in [[Finnish mythology]], the [[Hindu]] god [[Indra]], and the [[Shinto]] god [[Raijin]].<ref>{{cite book|chapter-url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/login.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6973441&url=http%3A%2F%2Fieeexplore.ieee.org%2Fxpls%2Fabs_all.jsp%3Farnumber%3D6973441|title=IEEE Xplore|pages=1909–1918|work=ieee.org|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402224733/http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/login.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6973441&url=http%3A%2F%2Fieeexplore.ieee.org%2Fxpls%2Fabs_all.jsp%3Farnumber%3D6973441|df=mdy-all|doi=10.1109/ICLP.2014.6973441|chapter=Lightning; Gods and sciences|year=2014|last1=Gomes|first1=Chandima|last2=Gomes|first2=Ashen|isbn=978-1-4799-3544-4}}</ref> In the traditional religion of the African [[Bantu peoples|Bantu]] tribes, lightning is a sign of the ire of the gods. Verses in the [[Jewish]] religion and in [[Islam]] also ascribe supernatural importance to lightning. In [[Christianity]], the [[Second Coming]] of [[Jesus]] is compared to lightning.{{Bibleref2c|Matthew|24:27}}{{Bibleref2c|Luke|17:24}}

The expression "Lightning never strikes twice (in the same place)" is similar to "Opportunity never knocks twice" in the vein of a "once in a lifetime" opportunity, ''i.e.'', something that is generally considered improbable. Lightning occurs frequently and more so in specific areas. Since various factors alter the [[probability]] of strikes at any given location, repeat lightning strikes have a very low probability (but are not impossible).<ref name="uman2">[[#Uman|Uman (1986)]] Ch. 6, p. 47.</ref><ref>{{cite news| title = Jesus actor struck by lightning| publisher = BBC News| date = October 23, 2003| url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/3209223.stm| accessdate = August 19, 2007| deadurl = no| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070917055711/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/3209223.stm| archivedate = September 17, 2007| df = mdy-all}}</ref> Similarly, "A bolt from the blue" refers to something totally unexpected.

Some political parties use lightning flashes as a symbol of power, such as the [[People's Action Party]] in [[Singapore]], the [[British Union of Fascists]] during the 1930s, and the [[National States' Rights Party]] in the [[United States]] during the 1950s.<ref>[http://mauryk2.com/2010/11/06/john-kasper-the-national-states-rights-party-and-the-demise-of-the-old-south/ Picture of John Kaspar of the National States Rights Party speaking in front of the party’s lightning bolt flag (the flag was red, white, and blue)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130203185623/http://mauryk2.com/2010/11/06/john-kasper-the-national-states-rights-party-and-the-demise-of-the-old-south/ |date=February 3, 2013 }}.

Retrieved on April 9, 2013.</ref> The [[Schutzstaffel]], the [[paramilitary]] wing of the [[Nazi Party]], used the [[Sig (rune)|Sig rune]] in their logo which symbolizes lightning. The [[German language|German]] word [[Blitzkrieg]], which means "lightning war", was a major offensive strategy of the German army during [[World War II]].

In [[French language|French]] and [[Italian language|Italian]], the expression for "Love at first sight" is ''coup de foudre'' and ''colpo di fulmine'', respectively, which literally translated means "lightning strike". Some European languages have a separate word for lightning which strikes the ground (as opposed to lightning in general); often it is a [[cognate]] of the English word "rays". The name of [[New Zealand]]'s most celebrated [[thoroughbred]] horse, [[Phar Lap]], derives from the shared [[Standard Zhuang|Zhuang]] and [[Thai language|Thai]] word for lightning.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://museumvictoria.com.au/pharlap/horse/lightning.asp |title=Lightning |work=Phar Lap: Australia's wonder horse |publisher=Museum Victoria |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091024205404/http://museumvictoria.com.au/pharlap/horse/lightning.asp |archivedate=October 24, 2009 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>

The bolt of lightning in [[heraldry]] is called a [[thunderbolt]] and is shown as a zigzag with non-pointed ends. This symbol usually represents power and speed.

The lightning bolt is used to represent the instantaneous communication capabilities of electrically powered [[telegraph]]s and [[radio]]s. It was a commonly used motif in [[Art Deco]] design, especially the [[zig-zag]] Art Deco design of the late 1920s.<ref>{{cite book|author=Hillier, Bevis|title=Art Deco of the 20s and 30s|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7YBPAAAAMAAJ|date=1968|publisher=Studio Vista|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160426142458/https://books.google.com/books?id=7YBPAAAAMAAJ|archivedate=April 26, 2016|df=mdy-all}}</ref> The lightning bolt is a common insignia for [[military communications]] units throughout the world. A lightning bolt is also the [[NATO Military Symbols for Land Based Systems|NATO symbol for a signal asset]].

The Unicode symbol for lightning is ☇ U+2607
