It is part of New England, although portions of it are often grouped with New York and [[New Jersey]] as the [[New York metropolitan area|Tri-state area]]. The state is named for the [[Connecticut River]] which approximately bisects the state. The word "Connecticut" is derived from various anglicized spellings of an [[Algonquian languages|Algonquian]] word for "long tidal river".<ref>{{cite book|last=Trumbull|first=James Hammond|title=Indian Names of Places, Etc., in and on the Borders of Connecticut: With Interpretations of Some of Them|year=1881 |location=Harford, Connecticut |publisher=Press of the Case, Lockwood & Brainard Company |url={{google books|JS8TAAAAYAAJ|plainurl=yes|page=60}} |page=60}}</ref>

Connecticut's first European settlers were Dutchmen who established a small, short-lived settlement called [[Fort Hoop]] in Hartford at the confluence of the [[Park River (Connecticut)|Park]] and Connecticut Rivers. Half of Connecticut was initially part of the Dutch colony [[New Netherland]], which included much of the land between the Connecticut and [[Delaware River]]s, although the first major settlements were established in the 1630s by the English. [[Thomas Hooker]] led a band of followers from the [[Massachusetts Bay Colony]] and founded the [[Connecticut Colony]]; other settlers from Massachusetts founded the [[Saybrook Colony]] and the [[New Haven Colony]]. The Connecticut and New Haven colonies established documents of [[Fundamental Orders of Connecticut|Fundamental Orders]], considered the first constitutions in America. In 1662, the three colonies were merged under a royal charter, making Connecticut a [[crown colony]]. This was one of the [[Thirteen Colonies]] which rejected British rule in the [[American Revolution]].

Connecticut is the third smallest state by area,<ref name="census table 18">{{cite report |url=https://www.census.gov/prod/cen2010/cph-2-1.pdf |title=Table 18, Area Measurements: 2010; and Population and Housing Unit Density: 1990 to 2010 |publisher=United States Census Bureau |date=September 2012 |work=United States Summary: 2010, Population and Housing Unit Counts |p=41 |access-date=May 16, 2014}}</ref> the 29th most populous,<ref>{{cite report |url=https://www.census.gov/prod/cen2010/cph-2-1.pdf |title=Table 19, Population by Urban and Rural and Type of Urban Area: 2010 |publisher=United States Census Bureau |date=September 2012 |work=United States Summary: 2010, Population and Housing Unit Counts |p=42 |access-date=May 16, 2014}}</ref> and the fourth most densely populated<ref name="census table 18"/> of the 50 states. It is known as the "Constitution State", the "Nutmeg State", the "Provisions State", and the "Land of Steady Habits".<ref name=SOTS/> It was influential in the development of the federal government of the United States.

The Connecticut River, [[Thames River (Connecticut)|Thames River]], and ports along Long Island Sound have given Connecticut a strong maritime tradition which continues today. The state also has a long history of hosting the financial services industry, including insurance companies in Hartford and hedge funds in [[Fairfield County, Connecticut|Fairfield County]].

Connecticut is bordered on the south by [[Long Island Sound]], on the west by [[New York (state)|New York]], on the north by [[Massachusetts]], and on the east by [[Rhode Island]]. The state capital and fourth largest city is [[Hartford]], and other major cities and towns (by population) include [[Bridgeport, Connecticut|Bridgeport]], [[New Haven]], [[Stamford, Connecticut|Stamford]], [[Waterbury, Connecticut|Waterbury]], [[Norwalk, Connecticut|Norwalk]], [[Danbury, Connecticut|Danbury]], [[New Britain, Connecticut|New Britain]], [[Greenwich, Connecticut|Greenwich]], and [[Bristol, Connecticut|Bristol]]. Connecticut is slightly larger than the country of [[Montenegro]]. There are 169 [[New England town|incorporated towns]] in Connecticut.[[File:Map of Connecticut NA cropped.png|upright=1.25|thumb|Map of Connecticut]]
The highest peak in Connecticut is [[Bear Mountain (Connecticut)|Bear Mountain]] in [[Salisbury, Connecticut|Salisbury]] in the northwest corner of the state. The highest point is just east of where Connecticut, [[Massachusetts]], and New York meet (42° 3' N; 73° 29' W), on the southern slope of [[Mount Frissell]], whose peak lies nearby in Massachusetts.<ref>{{cite peakbagger |pid=7083 |name=Mount Frissell-South Slope, Connecticut/Massachusetts}}</ref> At the opposite extreme, many of the coastal towns have areas that are less than 20 feet (6 m) above sea level.

Connecticut has a long maritime history and a reputation based on that history—yet the state has no direct oceanfront (technically speaking). The coast of Connecticut sits on [[Long Island Sound]], which is an [[estuary]]. The state's access to the open Atlantic Ocean is both to the west (toward New York City) and to the east (toward the "race" near Rhode Island). This situation provides many safe harbors from ocean storms, and many transatlantic ships seek anchor inside Long Island Sound when [[tropical cyclones]] pass off the upper East Coast.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}

The [[Connecticut River]] cuts through the center of the state, flowing into Long Island Sound. The most populous metropolitan region centered within the state lies in the [[Connecticut River Valley]]. Despite Connecticut's relatively small size, it features wide regional variations in its landscape; for example, in the northwestern [[Litchfield Hills]], it features rolling mountains and horse farms, whereas in areas to the east of New Haven along the coast, the landscape features coastal [[marsh]]es, [[beach]]es, and large scale maritime activities.

{{further|List of Connecticut rivers}}

Connecticut's rural areas and small towns in the northeast and northwest corners of the state contrast sharply with its industrial cities such as Stamford, Bridgeport, and New Haven, located along the coastal highways from the New York border to New London, then northward up the Connecticut River to Hartford. Many towns in northeastern and northwestern Connecticut center around a [[village green|green]], such as the Litchfield Green, Lebanon Green (the largest in the state), and Wethersfield Green (the oldest in the state). Near the green typically stand historical visual symbols of [[New England]] towns, such as a white [[church (building)|church]], a [[colonial meeting house]], a colonial [[tavern]] or [[inn]], several [[American colonial architecture|colonial houses]], and so on, establishing a scenic historical appearance maintained for both [[historic preservation]] and tourism. Many of the areas in southern and coastal Connecticut have been built up and rebuilt over the years, and look less visually like traditional New England.

The northern boundary of the state with Massachusetts is marked by the Southwick Jog or Granby Notch, an approximately {{convert|2.5|mile|km}} square detour into Connecticut. The origin of this anomaly is clearly established in a long line of disputes and temporary agreements which were finally concluded in 1804, when southern [[Southwick, Massachusetts|Southwick's]] residents sought to leave Massachusetts, and the town was split in half.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.southwickma.org/Public_Documents/SouthwickMA_WebDocs/southwick_jog.pdf |title=The Southwick Jog |last=Dodge |first=Edward R. |website=Town of Southwick, Massachusetts |access-date=October 25, 2015 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5p1plFeFC?url=http://www.southwickma.org/Public_Documents/F000102F9/S00476B50-00476B5B.0/The%20Southwick%20Jog.pdf |archivedate=April 16, 2010 |deadurl=yes  }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cslib.org/jog.htm |title=Connecticut's Southwick Jog |publisher=Connecticut State Library |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5uKkzcI4A?url=http://www.cslib.org/jog.htm |archivedate=November 18, 2010 |deadurl=yes  }}</ref>

The southwestern border of Connecticut where it abuts New York State is marked by a [[Salient (geography)|panhandle]] in [[Fairfield County, Connecticut|Fairfield County]], containing the towns of [[Greenwich, Connecticut|Greenwich]], [[Stamford, Connecticut|Stamford]], [[New Canaan, Connecticut|New Canaan]], [[Darien, Connecticut|Darien]], and parts of [[Norwalk, Connecticut|Norwalk]] and [[Wilton, Connecticut|Wilton]]. This irregularity in the boundary is the result of [[History of Connecticut#Territorial disputes|territorial disputes]] in the late 17th century, culminating with New York giving up its claim to the area, whose residents considered themselves part of Connecticut, in exchange for an equivalent area extending northwards from [[Ridgefield, Connecticut|Ridgefield]] to the Massachusetts border, as well as undisputed claim to [[Rye (town), New York|Rye, New York]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cslib.org/panhandle.htm |title=Connecticut's "Panhandle" |website=Connecticut State Library |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5uKl03gYx?url=http://www.cslib.org/panhandle.htm |archivedate=November 18, 2010 |deadurl=yes  }}</ref>

Much of Connecticut has a [[humid continental climate]], with cold winters with moderate snowfall and mild, humid summers. Coastal Connecticut has a borderline [[temperate climate]] (called humid subtropical in some climate classifications) climate with hot, humid summers and milder winters with a mix of rain and infrequent snow. Most of Connecticut sees a fairly even precipitation pattern with rainfall/snowfall spread throughout the 12 months. Connecticut averages 56% of possible sunshine, averaging 2,400 hours of [[sunshine]] annually.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://maps.howstuffworks.com/united-states-annual-sunshine-map.htm |title=United States Annual Sunshine Map |website=HowStuffWorks |accessdate=March 15, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110429042722/http://maps.howstuffworks.com/united-states-annual-sunshine-map.htm |archivedate=April 29, 2011  }}</ref>

Early spring (April) can range from slightly cool to warm, while mid and late spring (late April/May) is warm. By June, the building [[Bermuda High]] creates a southerly flow of warm and humid tropical air, bringing hot weather conditions throughout the state, with average highs in New London of {{convert|81|F|C}} and {{convert|85|F|C}} in Windsor Locks at the peak of summer in late July. Although summers are sunny in Connecticut, quick moving summer thunderstorms can bring brief downpours with thunder and lightning. Occasionally these thunderstorms can be severe, and the state usually averages one tornado per year.<ref name="tornadoes">{{cite web |url= http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/img/climate/research/tornado/small/avgt5304.gif | title=Annual average number of tornadoes| publisher=NOAA National Climatic Data Center |format=[[GIF]] |accessdate=October 24, 2006}}</ref> During hurricane season, the remains of tropical cyclones occasionally affect the region, though a direct hit is rare.

Weather commonly associated with the fall season typically begins in October and lasts to the first days of December. Daily high temperatures in October and November range from the 50s to 60s (Fahrenheit) with nights in the 40s and upper 30s. Colorful foliage begins across northern parts of the state in late September and moves south and east reaching southeast Connecticut by early November. Far southern and coastal areas however have more oak and hickory trees (and fewer maples), and are often less colorful than areas to the north. By early December average overnight lows are below freezing across the entire state.

Winters (December through mid March) are generally cold from south to north in Connecticut. The coldest month (January) has average high temperatures ranging from {{convert|38|F|C}} in the coastal lowlands to {{convert|33|F|C}} in the inland and northern portions on the state. The average yearly snowfall ranges from about {{convert|60|in|mm}} in the higher elevations of the northern portion of the state to only {{convert|20-25|in|mm}} along the southeast coast of Connecticut (Branford to Groton). Generally, any locale north or west of [[Interstate 84 (Pennsylvania–Massachusetts)|Interstate 84]] receives the most snow, during a storm, and throughout the season. Most of Connecticut has less than 60 days of snow cover. Snow usually falls from late November to late March in the northern part of the state, and from early December to mid March in the southern and coastal parts of the state.

Connecticut's record high temperature is {{convert|106|F|C}} which occurred in [[Danbury, Connecticut|Danbury]] on July 15, 1995; the record low is {{convert|-32|F|C}} which occurred in the Northwest Hills [[Falls Village, Connecticut|Falls Village]] on February 16, 1943, and [[Coventry, Connecticut|Coventry]] on January 22, 1961.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/extremes/scec/getextreme.php?elem=ALL&state=CT| title = All-Time Climate Extremes for CT|publisher=[[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]]|accessdate=March 18, 2011}}</ref>

Forests consist of a mix of [[Northeastern coastal forests]] of Oak in southern areas of the state, to the upland [[New England-Acadian forests]] in the northwestern parts of the state. Mountain Laurel ([[Kalmia latifolia]]) is the state flower, and is native to low ridges in several parts of Connecticut. Rosebay Rhododendron ([[Rhododendron maximum]]) is also native to eastern uplands of Connecticut and [[Pachaug State Forest]] is home to the Rhododendron Sanctuary Trail. Atlantic white cedar ([[Chamaecyparis thyoides]]), is found in wetlands in the southern parts of the state. Connecticut has one native cactus ([[Opuntia humifusa]]), found in sandy coastal areas and low hillsides. Several types of beach grasses and wildflowers are also native to Connecticut.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Olson |first1=David M. |last2=Dinerstein |first2=Eric |last3=Wikramanayake |first3=Eric D. |display-authors=etal |title=Terrestrial Ecoregions of the World: A New Map of Life on Earth |journal=[[BioScience]] |year=2001 |volume=51 |issue=11 |pages=933–938 |url=http://bioscience.oxfordjournals.org/content/51/11/933 |doi=10.1641/0006-3568(2001)051[0933:TEOTWA]2.0.CO;2 |issn=0006-3568}}</ref> Connecticut spans [[USDA Plant Hardiness Zones]] 5b to 7a.

The first European explorer in Connecticut was Dutchman [[Adriaen Block]],<ref>{{cite journal|last2=Varekamp|first2=Daphne|date=Spring–Summer 2006|title=Adriaen Block, The Discovery of Long Island Sound and the New Netherlands Colony: What Drove the Course of History?|url=http://seagrant.uconn.edu/publications/magazines/wracklines/springsummer06/block.pdf|journal=Wrack Lines|volume=6|issue=1|access-date=May 16, 2014|last1=Varekamp|first1=Johan|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151231223638/http://seagrant.uconn.edu/publications/magazines/wracklines/springsummer06/block.pdf|archivedate=December 31, 2015}}</ref> who explored the region in 1614. Dutch fur traders then sailed up the Connecticut River, which they called Versche Rivier ("Fresh River"), and built a fort at Dutch Point in Hartford that they named "House of Hope" ({{lang-nl|Huis van Hoop}}).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://colonialwarsct.org/1614.htm|title=1614 Adriaen|website=The Society of Colonial Wars in the State of Connecticut|access-date=May 16, 2014}}</ref>

The Connecticut Colony was originally a number of separate, smaller settlements at Windsor, Wethersfield, Saybrook, Hartford, and New Haven. The first English settlers came in 1633 and settled at Windsor, and then at Wethersfield the following year.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cslib.org/earlysettlers.htm|title=Early Settlers of Connecticut|publisher=Connecticut State Library|accessdate=July 25, 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100420061052/http://www.cslib.org/earlysettlers.htm|archivedate=April 20, 2010}}</ref> [[John Winthrop the Younger]] of Massachusetts received a commission to create [[Saybrook Colony]] at the mouth of the Connecticut River in 1635.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.saybrookhistory.org/web_page.php?id=13|title=Brief History of Old Saybrook|website=Old Saybrook Historical Society|access-date=May 16, 2014}}</ref>

The settlements were established without official sanction of the English Crown, and each was an independent political entity.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.colonialwarsct.org/1638_new_haven.htm|title=1638 - New Haven - The Independent Colony|website=The Society of Colonial Wars in the State of Connecticut|access-date=May 16, 2014}}</ref> In 1662, Winthrop traveled to England and obtained a charter from [[Charles II of England|Charles II]] which united the settlements of Connecticut.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://colonialwarsct.org/1662.htm|title=1662-Charter for Connecticut|website=The Society of Colonial Wars in the State of Connecticut|access-date=May 16, 2014}}</ref> Historically important colonial settlements included [[Windsor, Connecticut|Windsor]] (1633), [[Wethersfield, Connecticut|Wethersfield]] (1634), [[Deep River, Connecticut|Saybrook]] (1635), [[Hartford, Connecticut|Hartford]] (1636), [[New Haven, Connecticut|New Haven]] (1638), [[Fairfield, Connecticut|Fairfield]] (1639), [[Guilford, Connecticut|Guilford]] (1639), [[Milford, Connecticut|Milford]] (1639), [[Stratford, Connecticut|Stratford]] (1639), [[Farmington, Connecticut|Farmington]] (1640), [[Stamford, Connecticut|Stamford]] (1641), and [[New London, Connecticut|New London]] (1646).

The [[Pequot War]] marked the first major clash between colonists and Indians in New England. The Pequots reacted with increasing aggression to Colonial settlements in their territory—while simultaneously taking lands from the Narragansett and Mohegan tribes. Settlers responded to a murder in 1636 with a raid on a Pequot village on [[Block Island]]; the Pequots laid siege to Saybrook Colony's garrison that autumn, then raided Wethersfield in the spring of 1637. Colonists declared war on the Pequots, organized a band of militia and allies from the Mohegan and Narragansett tribes, and attacked a Pequot village on the [[Mystic River (Connecticut)|Mystic River]], with death toll estimates ranging between 300 and 700 Pequots. After suffering another major loss at a battle in [[Fairfield, Connecticut|Fairfield]], the Pequots asked for a truce and peace terms.<ref>{{cite book|url={{google books|YHVwmVKjhaoC|plainurl=yes|page=31}}|title=America's Beginnings: The Dramatic Events that Shaped a Nation's Character|last=Williams|first=Tony|date=2010|publisher=Rowman & Littlefield|isbn=978-1-4422-0487-4|pages=32–34}}</ref>

The western boundaries of Connecticut have been subject to change over time. The [[Treaty of Hartford (1650)|Hartford Treaty]] with the Dutch was signed on September 19, 1650, but it was never ratified by the British. According to it, the western boundary of Connecticut ran north from [[Greenwich, Connecticut|Greenwich Bay]] for a distance of {{convert|20|mile|km}},<ref name="BOWEN">{{cite book |last=Bowen |first=Clarence Winthrop |url={{google books|XJUNAAAAQAAJ|plainurl=yes|page=17}} |title=The Boundary Disputes of Connecticut |date=1882 | publisher=James R.

Connecticut's legislature authorized the outfitting of six new regiments in 1775, in the wake of the clashes between British regulars and Massachusetts militia at Lexington and Concord. There were some 1,200 Connecticut troops on hand at the [[Battle of Bunker Hill]] in June 1775.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.wpi.edu/academics/military/hillprelim.html |title=Battle of Bunker's Hill Preliminary Study |website=Military Science, Cadet Resources |publisher=Worcester Polytechnic Institute |access-date=May 18, 2014}}</ref>

In 1777, the British got word of [[Continental Army]] supplies in [[Danbury, Connecticut|Danbury]], and they landed an expeditionary force of some 2,000 troops in [[Westport, Connecticut|Westport]]. This force then marched to Danbury and destroyed homes and much of the depot.

====Early national period and industrial revolution====
Connecticut ratified the U.S. Constitution on January 9, 1788, becoming the fifth state.<ref name="AboutCT"/> The state prospered during the era following the American Revolution, as mills and textile factories were built and seaports flourished from trade<ref>{{cite book |last1=La Bella |first1=Laura |title=Connecticut: Past and Present |date=August 15, 2010 |publisher=[[Rosen Publishing]] |location=New York |page=17 |url={{google books|ZYJtf6CoCs4C|plainurl=yes|page=17}} |accessdate=February 17, 2015}}</ref> and fisheries.

In 1786, Connecticut ceded territory to the U.S. government that became part of the [[Northwest Territory]]. The state retained land extending across the northern part of present-day Ohio called the [[Connecticut Western Reserve]].<ref name="United States Summary 2010, page V-5">{{cite report |url=https://www.census.gov/prod/cen2010/cph-2-1.pdf |title=User Notes by Table: Table 12 |work=United States Summary: 2010, Population and Housing Unit Counts |publisher=United States Census Bureau |date=September 2010 |page=V-5 |access-date=May 16, 2014}}</ref> The Western Reserve section was settled largely by people from Connecticut, and they brought Connecticut place names to Ohio.

Connecticut made agreements with Pennsylvania and New York which extinguished her land claims within those states' boundaries and created the [[Connecticut Panhandle]]. The state then ceded the Western Reserve in 1800 to the federal government,<ref name="United States Summary 2010, page V-5"/> which brought it to its present boundaries (other than minor adjustments with Massachusetts).

The British blockade during the [[War of 1812]] hurt exports and bolstered the influence of Federalists who opposed the war.<ref>{{cite book |first1=James |last1=Boyland |first2=Glenn S. |last2=Gordinier |first3=Meredith |last3=Mason Brown |display-authors=etal |title=The Rockets' Red Glare: The War of 1812 and Connecticut |publisher=New London County Historical Society |date=2012 |isbn=978-0-9853-6240-9}}</ref> The cessation of imports from Britain stimulated the construction of factories to manufacture textiles and machinery.

The state was known for its political conservatism, typified by its Federalist party and the Yale College of [[Timothy Dwight IV|Timothy Dwight]]. The foremost intellectuals were Dwight and [[Noah Webster]],<ref>{{cite book |last1=Elliott |first1=Emory |title=Revolutionary Writers: Literature and Authority in the New Republic, 1725-1810 |date=1986 |orig-year=1982 |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |page=14 |url={{google books|WmI6avgH0GoC|plainurl=yes|page=14}} |accessdate=February 17, 2015}}</ref> who compiled his great dictionary in New Haven. Religious tensions polarized the state, as the Congregational Church struggled to maintain traditional viewpoints, in alliance with the Federalists.

A surge of national unity in 1861 brought thousands flocking to the colors from every town and city.

Connecticut's extensive industry, dense population, flat terrain, and wealth encouraged the construction of railroads starting in 1839. By 1840, {{convert|102|mile|km}} of line were in operation, growing to {{convert|402|mile|km}} in 1850 and {{convert|601|mile|km}} in 1860.<ref>{{cite book |first=Edward Chase |last=Kirkland |title=Men, Cities and Transportation, A Study of New England History 1820–1900 |publisher=Harvard University Press |date=1948 |volume=Vol 2 |pp=72–110, 288–306}}</ref>

The [[New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad]], called the ''New Haven'' or "The Consolidated", became the dominant Connecticut railroad company after 1872. [[J. P. Morgan]] began financing the major New England railroads in the 1890s, dividing territory so that they would not compete. The New Haven purchased 50 smaller companies, including steamship lines, and built a network of light rails (electrified trolleys) that provided inter-urban transportation for all of southern New England. By 1912, the New Haven operated over {{convert|2,000|mile|km}} of track with 120,000 employees.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://doddcenter.uconn.edu/asc/findaids/NHRR_Smallformat/MSS19910133.html |title=New York, New Haven & Hartford Railroad Small Format Photograph and Postcard Collection |website=Archives & Special Collections at the Thomas J.

====World War I====
When World War I broke out in 1914, Connecticut became a major supplier of weaponry to the U.S. military; by 1918, 80% of the state's industries were producing goods for the war effort.<ref>{{cite book |chapter=The Industrial Northeast: Connecticut |chapter-url={{google books|EP7bDoZcGTIC|plainurl=yes|page=107}} |last=Breen |first=William J. |title=Labor Market Politics and the Great War: The Department of Labor, the States and the First U.S. Employment Service, 1907-1933 |location=Kent, Ohio |publisher=Kent State University Press |date=1997 |page=107 |ref=harv |accessdate=May 29, 2014}}</ref> [[Remington Arms]] in Bridgeport produced half the small-arms cartridges used by the U.S. Army,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://connecticuthistory.org/topics-page/world-war-i/ |title=World War I |website=Connecticut History |accessdate=May 28, 2014}}</ref> with other major suppliers including [[Winchester Repeating Arms Company|Winchester]] in New Haven and [[Colt's Manufacturing Company|Colt]] in Hartford.{{sfn|Van Dusen|1961|pp=266-268}}

The state enthusiastically supported the American war effort in 1917 and 1918, with large purchases of war bonds, a further expansion of industry, and an emphasis on increasing food production on the farms. Thousands of state, local, and volunteer groups mobilized for the war effort and were coordinated by the Connecticut State Council of Defense.<ref>{{cite journal |first=William J. |last=Breen |title=Mobilization and Cooperative Federalism: The Connecticut State Council of Defense, 1917‐1919 |journal=Historian |date=1979 |volume=42 |issue=1 |pages=58–84 |doi=10.1111/j.1540-6563.1979.tb00574.x}}</ref> Manufacturers wrestled with manpower shortages; Waterbury's American Brass and Manufacturing Company was running at half capacity, so the federal government agreed to furlough soldiers to work there.{{sfn|Breen|1997|page=116}}

====Late 20th century====
Connecticut's dependence on the defense industry posed an economic challenge at the end of the [[Cold War]]. The resulting budget crisis helped elect [[Lowell Weicker]] as governor on a third-party ticket in 1990. Weicker's remedy was a state income tax which proved effective in balancing the budget, but only for the short-term. He did not run for a second term, in part because of this politically unpopular move.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cslib.org/gov/weickerl.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=May 17, 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140324093619/http://www.cslib.org/gov/weickerl.htm |archivedate=March 24, 2014  }} "Lowell Weicker Governor of Connecticut, 1991–1995", Connecticut State Library, 2008.

6.6% of its population was reported as being under 5 years old, 24.7% under 18 years old, and 13.8% were 65 years of age or older. Females made up approximately 51.6% of the population, with 48.4% male.

In 1790, 97% of the population in Connecticut was classified as "rural". The first census in which less than half the population was classified as rural was 1890. In the 2000 census, only 12.3% was considered rural.

===Taxation===
Before 1991, Connecticut had an investment-only [[income tax]] system. Income from employment was untaxed, but income from investments was taxed at 13%, the highest rate in the U.S., with no deductions allowed for costs of producing the investment income, such as interest on borrowing.

In 1991, under Governor [[Lowell P. Weicker Jr.]], an independent, the system was changed to one in which the taxes on employment income and investment income were equalized at a maximum rate of 4%. The new tax policy drew investment firms to Connecticut; {{as of|2014|lc=y}}, [[Fairfield County, Connecticut|Fairfield County]] was home to the headquarters for 14 of the 200 largest [[hedge fund]]s in the world.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.hfalert.com/documents/FG/hsp/hfa-rankings/459569_Top200Managers.pdf |title=Top 200 Hedge Fund Managers |website=Hedge Fund Alert |subscription=yes}}</ref>

{{as of|2014}}, the income tax rates on Connecticut individuals are divided into six tax brackets of 3% (on income up to $10,000); 5% ($10,000-$50,000); 5.5% ($50,000-$100,000); 6% ($100,000-$200,000); 6.5% ($200,000-$250,000); and 6.7% (more than $250,000), with additional amounts owed depending on the bracket.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.tax-brackets.org/connecticuttaxtable |title=Connecticut Income Tax Brackets |website=Tax-Brackets.org |date=2015 |access-date=October 24, 2015}}</ref>

All wages of Connecticut residents are subject to the state's income tax, even if earned outside the state. However, in those cases, Connecticut income tax must be withheld only to the extent the Connecticut tax exceeds the amount withheld by the other jurisdiction. Since New York and Massachusetts have higher tax rates than Connecticut, this effectively means that Connecticut residents that work in those states have no Connecticut income tax withheld. Connecticut permits a credit for taxes paid to other jurisdictions, but since residents who work in other states are still subject to Connecticut income taxation, they may owe taxes if the jurisdictional credit does not fully offset the Connecticut tax amount.

Oyster harvesting was historically an important source of income to towns along the Connecticut coastline. In the 19th century, oystering boomed in New Haven, Bridgeport, and Norwalk and achieved modest success in neighboring towns. In 1911, Connecticut's oyster production reached its peak at nearly 25 million pounds of oyster meats. This was, at the time, higher than production in New York, Rhode Island, or Massachusetts.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://connecticuthistory.org/oystering-in-connecticut-from-colonial-times-to-today/ |website=Connecticut History |title=Oystering in Connecticut, from Colonial Times to the 21st Century |access-date=October 25, 2015}}</ref> During this time, the Connecticut coast was known in the shellfishing industry as the oyster capital of the world. From before World War 1 until 1969, Connecticut laws restricted the right to harvest oysters in state-owned beds to sailing vessels. These laws prompted the construction of the oyster sloop style vessel that lasted well into the 20th century.<ref>{{cite book |title=This Fine Piece of Water: An Environmental History of Long Island Sound |first=Tom |last=Andersen |publisher=Yale University Press |date=2004 |orig-year=2002 |edition=revised |p=90 |url={{google books|WsvwJKNIewsC|plainurl=yes|page=90}} |isbn=978-0-3001-0287-1}}</ref> The sloop {{ship||Hope|sloop|2}} is believed to be the last oyster sloop built in Connecticut, completed in [[Greenwich, Connecticut|Greenwich]] in 1948.

==Transportation==
{{main|Transportation in Connecticut}}

===Roads===
{{main |List of State Routes in Connecticut}}
The [[Interstate highway]]s in the state are [[Interstate 95 in Connecticut|Interstate&nbsp;95]] (I-95; the [[Connecticut Turnpike]]) traveling southwest to northeast along the coast, [[Interstate 84 in Connecticut|I-84]] traveling southwest to northeast in the center of the state, [[Interstate 91 in Connecticut|I-91]] traveling north to south in the center of the state, and [[Interstate 395 in Connecticut|I-395]] traveling north to south near the eastern border of the state. The other major highways in Connecticut are the [[Merritt Parkway]] and [[Wilbur Cross Parkway]], which together form [[Connecticut Route 15]] (Route&nbsp;15), traveling from the [[Hutchinson River Parkway]] in [[New York City|New York]] parallel to I-95 before turning north of [[New Haven]] and traveling parallel to I-91, finally becoming a surface road in [[Berlin, Connecticut|Berlin]]. I-95 and Route&nbsp;15 were originally [[toll road]]s; they relied on a system of [[toll plaza]]s at which all traffic stopped and paid fixed tolls. A series of terrible crashes at these plazas eventually contributed to the decision to remove the tolls in 1988.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nycroads.com/roads/ct-turnpike/ |title=Connecticut Turnpike (I-95) |website=NYC Roads |access-date=October 25, 2015}}</ref> Other major arteries in the state include [[U.S. Route 7 in Connecticut|U.S. Route&nbsp;7]] (US&nbsp;7) in the west traveling parallel to the New York state line, [[Connecticut Route 8|Route&nbsp;8]] farther east near the industrial city of Waterbury and traveling north–south along the Naugatuck River Valley nearly parallel with US&nbsp;7, and [[Connecticut Route 9]] in the east.

Between New Haven and New York City, I-95 is one of the most congested highways in the United States. Although I-95 has been widened in several spots, some areas are only 3 lanes and this strains traffic capacity, resulting in frequent and lengthy [[rush hour]] delays. Frequently, the congestion spills over to clog the parallel Merritt Parkway and even US 1. The state has encouraged traffic reduction schemes, including rail use and [[carpool|ride-sharing]].<ref>{{cite web |url = http://ctrides.com/ways-to-commute/carpool | title=Ways to Commute |website= CT rides |publisher=State of Connecticut |accessdate=July 25, 2010}}</ref>

Connecticut also has a very active bicycling community, with one of the highest rates of bicycle ownership and use in the United States. New Haven's cycling community, organized in a local advocacy group called [[ElmCityCycling]], is particularly active. According to the US Census 2006 American Community Survey, New Haven has the highest percentage of commuters who bicycle to work of any major metropolitan center on the East Coast.{{Citation needed|date=October 2015}}

===Rail===
[[File:Metro-North train 1567 enters Stamford.jpg|upright=1.15|right|thumb|A [[Metro-North Railroad]] [[New Haven Line]] train leaving [[Stamford Transportation Center|Stamford Station]]]]
Rail is a popular travel mode between New Haven and New York City's [[Grand Central Terminal]]. Southwestern Connecticut is served by the [[Metro-North Railroad]]'s [[New Haven Line]], operated by the [[Metropolitan Transportation Authority]] and providing commuter service to New York City and New Haven, with branches servicing [[New Canaan Branch|New Canaan]], [[Danbury Branch|Danbury]], and [[Waterbury Branch|Waterbury]]. Connecticut lies along [[Amtrak]]'s [[Northeast Corridor]] which features frequent [[Northeast Regional]] and [[Acela Express]] service from New Haven south to New York City, Philadelphia, Baltimore, Washington, DC, and Norfolk, VA.

Coastal cities and towns between New Haven and New London are also served by the [[Shore Line East]] commuter line. Several new stations were completed along the Connecticut shoreline recently, and a commuter rail service called the [[Hartford Line]] between New Haven and Springfield on Amtrak's [[New Haven-Springfield Line]] began operating in June 2018.<ref>https://www.ctpost.com/business/article/Hartford-Line-debuts-with-10K-passengers-in-week-1-13027819.php</ref> 
A proposed commuter rail service, the [[Central Corridor Rail Line]], will connect New London with [[Norwich, CT|Norwich]], [[Willimantic, CT|Willimantic]], [[Storrs, CT|Storrs]], and [[Stafford Springs, CT|Stafford Springs]], with service continuing into [[Massachusetts]] and [[Brattleboro, VT|Brattleboro]]. Amtrak also operates a shuttle service between New Haven and [[Springfield, Massachusetts]], serving Wallingford, Meriden, Berlin, Hartford, Windsor Locks, and Springfield, MA and the [[Vermonter (train)|Vermonter]] runs from Washington to St. Albans, Vermont via the same line.

===Bus===
Statewide [[bus]] service is supplied by [[Connecticut Transit]], owned by the [[Connecticut Department of Transportation]], with smaller municipal authorities providing local service. Bus networks are an important part of the transportation system in Connecticut, especially in urban areas like Hartford, Stamford, Norwalk, Bridgeport and New Haven. Connecticut Transit also operates [[CTfastrak]], a [[bus rapid transit]] service between [[New Britain, Connecticut|New Britain]] and [[Hartford, Connecticut|Hartford]]. The bus route opened to the public on March 28, 2015.<ref name=march28>{{cite press release |url=http://ctfastrak.com/about/news/news-releases/13-media-releases/279-03-28-15-despite-snow-thousands-of-riders-many-first-timers-experience-ctfastrak-on-first-day-of-service |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150911222239/http://ctfastrak.com/about/news/news-releases/13-media-releases/279-03-28-15-despite-snow-thousands-of-riders-many-first-timers-experience-ctfastrak-on-first-day-of-service |archivedate=September 11, 2015 |title=Despite Snow, Thousands of Riders, Many First-Timers, Experience CTfastrak on First Day of Service |publisher=Connecticut Department of Transportation |date=March 28, 2015}}</ref><ref name=CTfastrak>{{cite web|title=What Is CTfastrak|url=http://www.ctfastrak.com/about/what-is-ctfastrak|publisher=State of Connecticut|accessdate=October 18, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131014173042/http://www.ctfastrak.com/about/what-is-ctfastrak|archive-date=October 14, 2013|dead-url=yes}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last1=LaPorte|first1=Mike|title=The Busway to the Future: Insider to CTfastrak before Opening to Public|url=http://livewiremcc.org/2014/11/05/the-busway-to-the-future-insider-to-ctfastrak-before-opening-to-public/|accessdate=December 11, 2014|work=The Live Wire|agency=Manchester Community College|date=November 5, 2014}}</ref>

Many residents of central and southern Connecticut also make heavy use of [[JFK International Airport]] and [[Newark International Airport]]s, especially for international travel. Smaller regional air service is provided at [[Tweed New Haven Regional Airport]]. Larger civil airports include [[Danbury Municipal Airport]] and [[Waterbury-Oxford Airport]] in western Connecticut, [[Hartford–Brainard Airport]] in central Connecticut, and [[Groton-New London Airport]] in eastern Connecticut. [[Sikorsky Memorial Airport]] is located in Stratford and mostly services cargo, helicopter and private aviation.

===Ferry===
The [[Bridgeport & Port Jefferson Ferry]] travels between [[Bridgeport, Connecticut]] and [[Port Jefferson, New York]] by crossing [[Long Island Sound]]. Ferry service also operates out of [[New London, Connecticut|New London]] to [[Orient, New York]]; [[Fishers Island, New York]]; and [[Block Island, Rhode Island]], which are popular tourist destinations. Small local services operate the [[Rocky Hill – Glastonbury Ferry]] and the [[Chester–Hadlyme Ferry]] which cross the Connecticut River.

===Constitutional history===
{{Main|History of the Connecticut Constitution}}
Connecticut is known as the "Constitution State". The origin of this nickname is uncertain, but it likely comes from Connecticut's pivotal role in the federal constitutional convention of 1787, during which [[Roger Sherman]] and [[Oliver Ellsworth]] helped to orchestrate what became known as the [[Connecticut Compromise]], or the Great Compromise. This plan combined the [[Virginia Plan]] and the [[New Jersey Plan]] to form a bicameral legislature, a form copied by almost every state constitution since the adoption of the federal constitution. Variations of the bicameral legislature had been proposed by Virginia and New Jersey, but Connecticut's plan was the one that was in effect until the early 20th century, when Senators ceased to be selected by their state legislatures and were instead directly elected. Otherwise, it is still the design of Congress.

The nickname also might refer to the [[Fundamental Orders of Connecticut|Fundamental Orders]] of 1638–39. These Fundamental Orders represent the framework for the first formal Connecticut state government written by a representative body in Connecticut. The State of Connecticut government has operated under the direction of four separate documents in the course of the state's [[History of the Connecticut Constitution|constitutional history]]. After the Fundamental Orders, Connecticut was granted governmental authority by King [[Charles II of England]] through the Connecticut Charter of 1662.

Separate branches of government did not exist during this period, and the General Assembly acted as the supreme authority. A constitution similar to the modern [[U.S. Constitution]] was not adopted in Connecticut until 1818. Finally, the current state constitution was implemented in 1965. The 1965 constitution absorbed a majority of its 1818 predecessor, but incorporated a handful of important modifications.

===Executive===
The governor heads the executive branch. {{As of|2011}}, [[Dannel Malloy]] is the [[List of Governors of Connecticut|Governor]]<ref>{{cite web | url=http://portal.ct.gov/Departments_and_Agencies/Office_of_the_Governor/About/Governor_Malloy_s_Biography/ | title=Governor Malloy's Biography | publisher=State of Connecticut | website=Portal.CT.gov | accessdate=October 25, 2015}}</ref> and [[Nancy Wyman]] is the [[List of Lieutenant Governors of Connecticut|Lieutenant Governor]],<ref>{{cite web | url=http://portal.ct.gov/Departments_and_Agencies/Office_of_the_Lieutenant_Governor/About/Lt__Governor_s_Biography/ | title=Lt.

Malloy, the former mayor of [[Stamford, Connecticut|Stamford]], won the [[Connecticut gubernatorial election, 2010|2010 general election]] for Governor, and was sworn in on January 5, 2011. From 1639 until the adoption of the 1818 constitution, the governor presided over the General Assembly. In 1974, [[Ella Grasso]] was elected as the governor of Connecticut. This was the first time in United States history when a woman was a governor without her husband being governor first.<ref name=Pumont/>

There are several executive departments: Administrative Services, Agriculture, Banking, Children and Families, Consumer Protection, Correction, Economic and Community Development, [[Connecticut Department of Developmental Services|Developmental Services]], Construction Services, Education, Emergency Management and Public Protection, Energy & Environmental Protection, Higher Education, Insurance, Labor, Mental Health and Addiction Services, Military, Motor Vehicles, Public Health, Public Utility Regulatory Authority, Public Works, Revenue Services, Social Services, [[Connecticut Department of Transportation|Transportation]], and Veterans Affairs. In addition to these departments, there are other independent bureaus, offices and commissions.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://portal.ct.gov/Department-and-Agencies/ |title=Departments and Agencies |website=Portal.CT.gov |publisher=State of Connecticut |access-date=October 25, 2015}}</ref>

In addition to the Governor and Lieutenant Governor, there are four other executive officers named in the state constitution that are elected directly by voters: Secretary of the State, Treasurer, Comptroller, and Attorney General. All executive officers are elected to four-year terms.<ref name="AboutCT"/>

===Legislative===
The legislature is the [[Connecticut General Assembly|General Assembly]]. The General Assembly is a [[bicameral]] body consisting of an upper body, the [[Connecticut Senate|State Senate]] (36 senators); and a lower body, the [[Connecticut House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] (151 representatives).<ref name="AboutCT"/> Bills must pass each house in order to become law. The governor can veto the bill, but this veto can be overridden by a two-thirds majority in each house. Per Article XV of the state constitution, Senators and Representatives must be at least 18 years of age and are elected to two-year terms in November on even-numbered years. There also must always be between 30 and 50 senators and 125 to 225 representatives. The Lieutenant Governor presides over the Senate, except when absent from the chamber, when the [[Presidents pro tempore of the Connecticut Senate|President pro tempore]] presides. The [[Speaker (politics)|Speaker of the House]] presides over the House.<ref name="CT_CONST">{{cite web |title=Constitution of the State of Connecticut |website=Secretary of the State |publisher=State of Connecticut |url=http://www.sots.ct.gov/sots/cwp/view.asp?A=3188&Q=392288 |date=April 21, 2009 |accessdate=October 25, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151109004649/http://www.sots.ct.gov/sots/cwp/view.asp?a=3188&q=392288 |archive-date=November 9, 2015 |dead-url=yes |df=mdy-all }}</ref> {{As of|2014}}, [[Brendan Sharkey]] is the Speaker of the House of Connecticut.

===Judicial===
The highest [[court]] of Connecticut's judicial branch is the [[Connecticut Supreme Court]], headed by the Chief Justice of Connecticut. The Supreme Court is responsible for deciding on the constitutionality of the law or cases as they relate to the law. Its proceedings are similar to those of the United States Supreme Court, with no testimony given by witnesses, and the lawyers of the two sides each present oral arguments no longer than thirty minutes. Following a court proceeding, the court may take several months to arrive at a judgment. {{As of|2015|}} the [[Chief Justice]] is [[Chase T. Rogers]].<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.jud.state.ct.us/external/supapp/justiceRogers.html | title=Chief Justice Chase T. Rogers | publisher=State of Connecticut | website=Biographies of Supreme Court Justices, Judicial Branch | accessdate=October 25, 2015}}</ref>

In 1818, the court became a separate entity, independent of the legislative and executive branches.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.jud.state.ct.us/ystday/history.html |title=About Connecticut Courts: History of the  Courts |website=Judicial Branch |publisher=State of Connecticut |access-date=February 20, 2007}}</ref> The Appellate Court is a lesser statewide court and the Superior Courts are lower courts that resemble county courts of other states.

The State of Connecticut also offers access to [[Arrest warrant]] enforcement statistics through the Office of Policy and Management.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ct.gov/opm/cwp/view.asp?a=2969&Q=383588&opm_Nav_GID=1797 |title=Monthly Arrest Warrant Report |website=Office of Policy and Management |publisher=State of Connecticut |date=October 1, 2015 |accessdate=October 25, 2015}}</ref>

The state is divided into 169 towns which serve as the fundamental political jurisdictions.<ref name="AboutCT"/> There are also 21 cities,<ref name="AboutCT"/> most of which simply follow the boundaries of their namesake towns and have a merged city-town government. There are two exceptions: the [[Groton (city), Connecticut|City of Groton]], which is a subsection of the [[Groton (town), Connecticut|Town of Groton]], and the City of [[Winsted, Connecticut|Winsted]] in the Town of [[Winchester, Connecticut|Winchester]]. There are also nine incorporated [[Borough (Connecticut)|boroughs]] which may provide additional services to a section of town.<ref name="AboutCT"/><ref>{{cite web |title=Town Elections, Boroughs in Connecticut with Date of Incorporation |website=Secretary of the State |publisher=State of Connecticut |date=June 19, 2013 |url=http://www.sots.ct.gov/sots/cwp/view.asp?a=3188&q=392430#CITIES_IN_CONNECTICUT_WITH_DATE_OF_INCORPORATION |access-date=October 25, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150908155417/http://www.sots.ct.gov/sots/cwp/view.asp?a=3188&q=392430#CITIES_IN_CONNECTICUT_WITH_DATE_OF_INCORPORATION |archive-date=September 8, 2015 |dead-url=yes |df=mdy-all }}</ref> [[Naugatuck]] is a consolidated town and borough.

The state is also divided into 15 [[Administrative divisions of Connecticut#Regions|planning regions]] defined by the state Office of Planning and Management, with the exception of the Town of Stafford in Tolland County.<ref name="OPM">{{cite web  |url=http://www.ct.gov/opm/cwp/view.asp?a=2985&q=383124 |title=Regional Planning Coordination |website=Office of Policy and Management |publisher=State of Connecticut |accessdate=July 25, 2010}}</ref> The Intragovernmental Policy Division of this Office coordinates regional planning with the administrative bodies of these regions. Each region has an administrative body known as a regional council of governments, a regional council of elected officials, or a regional planning agency. The regions are established for the purpose of planning "coordination of regional and state planning activities; redesignation of logical planning regions and promotion of the continuation of regional planning organizations within the state; and provision for technical aid and the administration of financial assistance to regional planning organizations".<ref name="OPM"/>

===Registered voters===
Connecticut residents who register to vote have the option of declaring an affiliation to a political party, may become unaffiliated at will, and may change affiliations subject to certain waiting periods. {{as of|2018}} about 60% of registered voters are enrolled (just over 1% total in 28 [[Third party (politics)|third parties]] minor parties), and ratios among unaffiliated voters and the two major parties are about 8 unaffiliated for every 7 in the [[Democratic Party of Connecticut]] and for every 4 in the [[Connecticut Republican Party]].

(Among the minor parties, the [[Libertarian Party of Connecticut|Libertarian Party]] and [[Connecticut Green Party|Green Party]] appeared in the Presidential-electors column in 2016, and drew, respectively, 2.96% and 1.39% of the vote.)

Many Connecticut towns and cities show a marked preference for moderate candidates of either party.{{Ref}}

It may have come from its sailors returning from voyages with nutmeg, which was a very valuable spice in the 18th and 19th centuries. It may have originated in the early machined sheet tin nutmeg grinders sold by early Connecticut peddlers. It is also facetiously said to come from [[Yankee]] peddlers from Connecticut who would sell small carved nobs of wood shaped to look like nutmeg to unsuspecting customers.<ref name = "cslib" /> [[George Washington]] gave Connecticut the title of "The Provisions State"<ref name=SOTS/> because of the material aid that the state rendered to the [[American Revolutionary War]] effort. Connecticut is also known as "The Land of Steady Habits".<ref name=SOTS />

According to ''Webster's New International Dictionary'' (1993), a person who is a native or resident of Connecticut is a "Connecticuter". There are numerous other terms coined in print but not in use, such as "Connecticotian" ([[Cotton Mather]] in 1702) and "Connecticutensian" ([[Samuel Peters]] in 1781). Linguist Allen Walker Read suggests the more playful term "connecticutie". "[[Nutmegger]]" is sometimes used,<ref name="cslib">{{cite web|url=http://www.cslib.org/nicknamesCT.htm |title=Connecticut's Nicknames |website=Connecticut State Library |accessdate=September 15, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110905051813/http://www.cslib.org/nicknamesCT.htm |archivedate=September 5, 2011 }}</ref> as is "[[Yankee]]" The official state song is "[[Yankee Doodle]]".
