A '''catamaran''' ({{IPAc-en|ˌ|k|æ|t|ə|m|ə|ˈ|r|æ|n}}) (informally, a "cat") is a [[multihull|multi-hulled]] [[watercraft]] featuring two parallel [[hull (watercraft)|hulls]] of equal size. It is a geometry-stabilized craft, deriving its stability from its wide [[beam (nautical)|beam]], rather than from a ballasted [[keel]] as with a [[monohull]] [[sailboat]].  Catamaran is from a [[Tamil language|Tamil]] word, ''kattumaran'', which means "logs tied together". 

Catamarans typically have less hull volume, higher displacement, and shallower [[draft (hull)|draft]] (draught) than monohulls of comparable length. The two hulls combined also often have a smaller hydrodynamic [[drag (physics)|resistance]] than comparable monohulls, requiring less propulsive power from either sails or motors. The catamaran's wider stance on the water can reduce both [[Heeling (sailing)#Heeling|heeling]] and wave-induced motion, as compared with a monohull, and can give reduced wakes.

Catamarans range in size from small ([[sailing]] or [[rowing]] vessels) to large (naval ships and [[Roll-on/roll-off|car ferries]]). The structure connecting a catamaran's two hulls ranges from a simple frame strung with webbing to support the crew to a bridging superstructure incorporating extensive cabin and/or cargo space.

==History==
Catamarans from [[Oceania]] and [[Maritime Southeast Asia]] became the inspiration for modern catamarans.

Catamaran-type vessels was one of the earliest technological innovations of the [[Austronesian peoples]]. Early researchers like Heine-Geldern (1932) and Hornell (1943) once believed that catamarans evolved from [[outrigger canoe]]s, but modern authors specializing in Austronesian cultures like Doran (1981) and Mahdi (1988) now believe it to be the opposite.<ref name="Mahdi1999"/><ref name="Doran1981"/><ref name="Doran1974"/>

Two canoes bound together developed directly from minimal raft technologies of two logs tied together. Over time, the double-hulled canoe form developed into the asymmetric double canoe, where one hull is smaller than the other. Eventually the smaller hull became the prototype [[outrigger]], giving way to the single outrigger canoe, then to the reversible single outrigger canoe. Finally, the single outrigger types developed into the double outrigger canoe (or [[trimaran]]s).<ref name="Mahdi1999"/><ref name="Doran1981"/><ref name="Doran1974">{{cite journal |last1=Doran |first1=Edwin, Jr. |title=Outrigger Ages |journal=The Journal of the Polynesian Society |date=1974 |volume=83 |issue=2 |pages=130-140 |url=http://www.jps.auckland.ac.nz/document//Volume_83_1974/Volume_83%2C_No._2/Outrigger_ages%2C_by_Edwin_Doran_Jnr.%2C_p_130-140/p1}}</ref>

This would also explain why older Austronesian populations in [[Island Southeast Asia]], [[Madagascar]], and the [[Comoros]] tend to favor double outrigger canoes, as it keeps the boats stable when [[tacking (sailing)|tacking]]. But they still have small regions where catamarans and single-outrigger canoes are still used. In contrast, more distant outlying descendant populations in [[Micronesia]] and [[Polynesia]] retained the double-hull and the single outrigger canoe types, but the technology for double outriggers never reached them (although it exists in western [[Melanesia]]). To deal with the problem of the instability of the boat when the outrigger faces leeward when tacking, they instead developed the [[shunting (sailing)|shunting]] technique in sailing, in conjunction with reversible single-outriggers.<ref name="Mahdi1999">{{cite book|author=Mahdi, Waruno |editor=Blench, Roger |editor2=Spriggs, Matthew|title =Archaeology and Language III: Artefacts languages, and texts|chapter =The Dispersal of Austronesian boat forms in the Indian Ocean|volume = 34|publisher =Routledge|series =One World Archaeology |year =1999|page=144-179|isbn =0415100542|url =https://s3.amazonaws.com/academia.edu.documents/35025241/Mahdi_1WrldArchaeo34_1999.pdf?AWSAccessKeyId=AKIAIWOWYYGZ2Y53UL3A&Expires=1547229726&Signature=PbpMYp5JiK5eUgci4tCQ8KNWZYs%3D&response-content-disposition=inline%3B%20filename%3DThe_Dispersal_of_Austronesian_boat_forms.pdf}}</ref><ref name="Doran1981">{{cite book |last1=Doran |first1=Edwin B. |title=Wangka: Austronesian Canoe Origins |date=1981 |publisher=Texas A&M University Press |isbn=9780890961070}}</ref><ref name="Doran1974"/><ref name="Beheim">{{cite journal |last1=Beheim |first1=B.

Catamarans were seldom constructed in the West before the 19th century, but they were in wide use as early as the 5th century by the [[Tamils|Tamil people]] of [[Tamil Nadu]], [[South India]]. The word "catamaran" is derived from the Tamil word, ''kattumaram'' (கட்டுமரம்),   which means "logs bound together."<ref>{{cite book |last=Lück |first=Michael |date=2008 |title=The Encyclopedia of Tourism and Recreation in Marine Environments |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Yuc2Aro6ukkC&pg=PA86&lpg=PA86&dq=tamil+catamaran+5th+century&source=bl&ots=ZOa-qhmr7S&sig=Pdhu2BN37qDZFthn4rdE0bYUf68&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiupYiJlIzKAhXJ6yYKHXElDfQQ6AEIJjAC#v=onepage&q=tamil%20catamaran%205th%20century&f=false |location=Wallingford, UK |publisher=CABI |page=86 |isbn=978-1-84593-350-0}}</ref><ref name="dictionary">{{cite encyclopedia |title=Catamaran |encyclopedia=Dictionary.com Unabridged |url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/catamaran |year=2016 |publisher=Random House, inc.}}</ref> The 17th-century English adventurer and [[privateer]] [[William Dampier]] encountered the Tamil people of southeastern India during his first circumnavigation of the globe. He was the first to write in English about the watercraft he observed in use there.

The acquisition of the catamaran and [[outrigger canoe]] technology by the non-Austronesian peoples in Sri Lanka and southern India is due to the result of very early Austronesian colonization of the region that have since been assimilated, including the [[Maldives]] and [[Laccadive Islands]], estimated to have occurred around 1000 to 600 BCE and onwards. This is still evident in Sri Lankan and South Indian languages. For example, [[Tamil language|Tamil]] ''paṭavu'', [[Telugu language|Telugu]] ''paḍava'', and [[Kannada language|Kannada]] ''paḍahu'', all meaning "ship", are all derived from [[Proto-Hesperonesian|Proto&#8209;Hesperonesian]] ''*padaw'', "sailboat", with Austronesian cognates like [[Javanese language|Javanese]] ''[[perahu]]'', [[Kadazan language|Kadazan]] ''padau'', [[Maranao language|Maranao]] ''padaw'', [[Cebuano language|Cebuano]] ''[[paráw]]'', [[Samoan language|Samoan]] ''folau'', [[Hawaiian language|Hawaiian]] ''halau'', and [[Maori language|Maori]] ''wharau''.<ref name="Mahdi1999"/> Genetic studies on Maldivians have also identified Austronesian admixture.<ref>{{cite book |last= Maloney|first= C. |title= People of the Maldive Islands|publisher= Orient Longman Ltd, Madras |year= 1980 |isbn= 0-86131-158-2}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last= Duckworth|first= Wynfrid L.H. |title=n the Anthropometric Data collected by Professor John Stanley Gardiner, F.R.S., in the Maldive Islands and Minicoy|publisher= [[Cambridge Philosophical Society]]|year= 1914}}</ref>

===Development of modern catamarans===
The first documented example of double-hulled craft in [[Early modern Europe|Europe]] was designed by [[William Petty]] in 1662 to sail faster, in shallower waters, in lighter wind, and with fewer crew than other vessels of the time. However, the unusual design met with skepticism and was not a commercial success.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://royalsociety.org/exhibitions/350years/twin-hulled-ship/ |title=Model of a twin-hulled ship - William Petty |publisher=Royal Society |date= |accessdate=2014-08-08}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|date=September 22, 2000 |url=http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/story.asp?storyCode=153561&sectioncode=26 |title=Sailing with an Achilles' keel &#124; General |publisher=Times Higher Education |accessdate=2014-08-08}}</ref>

The design remained relatively unused in the West for almost 160 years until the early 19th-century, when the Englishman Mayflower F. Crisp built a two-hulled merchant ship in [[Yangon|Rangoon, Burma]]. The ship was christened ''Original''. Crisp described it as "a fast sailing fine sea boat; she traded during the monsoon between Rangoon and the Tenasserim Provinces for several years".<ref>{{cite book|author=Bertie Reginald Pearn|title=A History of Rangoon|publisher=Corporation of Rangoon|year=1938|page=136}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|author=M.

Later that century, the American [[Nathanael Herreshoff]] constructed a double-hulled sailing boat of his own design (US Pat. No. 189,459).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.google.com/patents/US189459|date=April 10, 1877|title=US Patent Number 189459: Improvement in construction of sailing-vessels|author=[[Nathanael Herreshoff]]}}</ref> The craft, ''Amaryllis'', raced at her maiden regatta on June 22, 1876, and performed exceedingly well. Her debut demonstrated the distinct performance advantages afforded to catamarans over the standard monohulls. It was as a result of this event, the Centennial Regatta of the New York Yacht Club, that catamarans were barred from regular sailing classes, and this remained the case until the 1970s.<ref name=ban>{{cite web|url=http://www.ulstc.org/Herreshoff.html |title=The Spirit of the Times, November 24, 1877 (reprint) |author=L.

In 1936 [[Eric de Bisschop]] built a Polynesian "double canoe" in [[Hawaii]] and sailed it home to a hero's welcome in France. In 1939, he published his experiences in a book, ''Kaimiloa'', which was translated into English in 1940.<ref>''The Voyage of the Kaimiloa'', London, 1940 (translated from French: ''Kaimiloa : D'Honolulu à Cannes par l'Australie et Le Cap, à bord d'une double pirogue polynésienne''), Editions Plon, Paris, 1939 (''Au delà des horizons lointains 1'').</ref>

The Prout Brothers, Roland and Francis, experimented with catamarans in 1949 and converted their 1935 boat factory in [[Canvey Island]], Essex (England), to catamaran production in 1954. Their Shearwater catamarans won races easily against the monohulls. ''Yellow Bird,'' a 1956-built Shearwater, raced successfully by Francis Prout in the 1960s, is in the collection of the [[National Maritime Museum Cornwall]].<ref>

In the mid-twentieth century, [[beachcat]]s became a widespread category of sailing catamarans, owing to their ease of launching and mass production. In California, a maker of [[surfboard]]s, [[Hobie Alter]], produced the {{convert|250|lb|kg|adj=on}} [[Hobie cat#Hobie 14|Hobie 14]] in 1967, and two years later the larger and even more successful [[Hobie 16]].

The [[Tornado (sailboat)|Tornado catamaran]] was designed by three Englishmen for a crew of two in 1967 as an Olympic catamaran candidate. At the Olympic Catamaran Trials of the International Yacht Racing Union, IYRU, it outperformed the other challengers for the role and was selected for the multihull discipline in the [[Olympic Games]] from 1976 through 2008. It was redesigned in 2000 and remains one of the fastest double-handed catamaran models.<ref>

==Performance characteristics==
Catamarans have two distinct primary performance characteristics that distinguish them from displacement monohull vessels: lower resistance to passage through the water and greater stability (initial resistance to capsize). Choosing between a monohull and catamaran configuration includes considerations of carrying capacity, speed, and efficiency.

===Resistance===
At low to moderate speeds, a lightweight catamaran hull experiences resistance to passage through water that is approximately proportional to the square of its speed. A displacement monohull, by comparison, experiences resistance that is at least the cube of its speed. This means that a catamaran would require four times the power in order to double its speed, whereas a monohull would require eight times the power to double its speed, starting at a slow speed.<ref name=Garrett/> For powered catamarans, this implies smaller power plants (although two are typically required). For sailing catamarans, [[Forces on sails#Reactive forces on sailing craft|low forward resistance]]<ref>

Sailing catamarans have been noted for incorporating technological advances over traditional monohull craft. These include [[hydrofoil|foils]] that lift racing catamarans out of the water, capacious and stable cruising vessels, and racers that have achieved average speeds on the open ocean, comparable to much larger vessels.

===Sport===
Recreational and sport catamarans typically are designed to have a crew of two and be launched and landed from a beach. Most have a trampoline on the bridging structure, a rotating mast and full-length battens on the mainsail. Performance versions often have trapezes to allow the crew to hike out and counterbalance capsize forces during strong winds on certain points of sail.<ref>

For the [[33rd America's Cup]], both the defender and the challenger built {{convert|90|ft|m|adj=on}} long multihulls. [[Société Nautique de Genève]], defending with team [[Alinghi]], sailed a catamaran. The challenger, BMW Oracle Racing, used a trimaran, replacing its soft sail rig with a towering [[wing sail]]—the largest sailing wing ever built. In the waters off [[Valencia]], Spain in February 2010, the BMW Oracle Racing trimaran with its powerful wing sail proved to be superior. This represented a break from the traditional monohulls that had always been sailed in previous [[America's Cup]] series.<ref>

On San Francisco Bay, the [[2013 America's Cup]] was sailed in {{convert|72|ft|m|adj=on}} long [[AC72]] catamarans (craft set by the rules for the 2013 America's Cup). Each yacht employed [[Sailing hydrofoil|hydrofoil]]s and a wing sail.

===Cruising===
Cruising sailors must make trade-offs among volume, useful load, speed, and cost in choosing a boat. Choosing a catamaran offers increased speed at the expense of reduced load per unit of cost. Howard and Doane describe the following tradeoffs between cruising monohulls and catamarans:<ref name="Offshore" /> A long-distance, offshore cruising monohull may be as short as {{convert|30|ft|m}} for a given crew complement and supporting supplies, whereas a cruising catamaran would need to be {{convert|40|ft|m}} to achieve the same capacity. In addition to greater speed, catamarans draw less water than do monohulls—little as {{convert|3|ft|m}}—and are easier to beach. Catamarans are harder to tack and take up more space in a marina. Cruising catamarans entail added expense for having two engines and two rudders. Tarjan adds that cruising catamarans boats can maintain a comfortable {{convert|300|nmi|mi km}} per day passage, with the racing versions recording well over {{convert|400|nmi|mi km}} per day. In addition, they do not heel more than 10-12 degrees, even at full speed on a reach.<ref>

===Ocean racing===
Yachting has seen the development of multihulls over {{convert|100|ft|m}} in length. "[[The Race (yachting race)|The Race]]" helped precipitate this trend; it was a circumnavigation challenge which departed from Barcelona, Spain, on New Year's Eve, 2000. Because of the prize money and prestige associated with this event, four new catamarans (and two highly modified ones) over {{convert|100|ft|m}} in length were built to compete. The largest, ''[[PlayStation (yacht)|PlayStation]]'', owned by [[Steve Fossett]], was {{convert|125|ft|m}} long and had a mast which was {{convert|147|ft|m}} above the water. Virtually all of the new mega-cats were built of pre-preg [[carbon fiber]] for strength and the lowest possible weight. The top speeds of these boats can approach {{convert|50|kn|mph km/h}}. The Race was won by the {{convert|33.50|m|abbr=on}}-long catamaran ''[[Club Med (yacht)|Club Med]]'' skippered by [[Grant Dalton]]. It went round the globe in 62 days at an average speed of {{convert|18|kn|mph km/h}}.<ref>

A catamaran configuration fills a niche for powered vessels, where speed and sea-kindliness is favored over bulk capacity. In larger vessels, this niche favors car ferries and military vessels for patrol or operation in the littoral zone. Two advances over the traditional catamaran are the ''small-waterplane-area twin hull'' (SWATH) and the ''wave-piercing'' configuration—the latter having become a widely favored design.

===Cruising===
An outgrowth of the popularity of cruising sailing catamarans are powered catamarans, which share many of the amenities found in a sail cruising catamaran.  The saloon typically spans two hulls wherein are found the staterooms and engine compartments. As with sailing catamarans, this configuration minimizes boat motion in a seaway.<ref>

===SWATH===
{{main|Small-waterplane-area twin hull}}
The [[small-waterplane-area twin hull]] (SWATH) configuration reduces wave-generating resistance by moving displacement volume below the waterline, using a pair of tubular, submarine-like hulls, connected by pylons to the bridge deck with a narrow waterline cross-section. The submerged hulls are minimally affected by waves.<ref name = Misra/> The SWATH form was invented by Canadian [[Frederick G. Creed]], who presented his idea in 1938 and was later awarded a British patent for it in 1946. It was first used in the 1960s and 1970s as an evolution of catamaran design for use as oceanographic research vessels or [[submarine]] rescue ships.<ref>

*Larger wetted surface, which causes higher skin friction drag.
*Significant reduction in wave-induced drag, with the configuration of struts and submerged hull structures.
*Lower water plane area significantly reduces pitching and heaving in a seaway.
*No possibility of planing.
*Higher sensitivity to loading, which may bring the bridge structure closer to the water.

===Wave-piercing===
[[Wave-piercing hull|Wave-piercing]] catamarans employ a low-buoyancy bow on each hull that is pointed at the water line and rises aft, up to a level, to allow each hull to pierce waves, rather than ride over them. This allows higher speeds through waves than for a conventional catamaran. They are distinguished from SWATH catamarans, in that the buoyant part of the hull is not tubular. The spanning bridge deck may be configured with some of the characteristics of a normal V-hull, which allows it to penetrate the crests of waves.<ref>

==Whitewater catamarans==
{{unreferenced section|date = February 2018}}
[[File:Katamarans in Russia.jpg|thumb|right|Catamarans for whitewater sports. Picture was taken in Altai, Russia]]
The catamarans for whitewater sports are widely spread in [[Post-Soviet states|post-Soviet countries]]. They consists of two inflatable hulls connected with a lattice scaffold. The frame of the tourist catamaran can be made of both - aluminum (duralumin) pipes, and from felled tree trunks. The inflatable part has two layers - airtight balloon with inflation holes and shell made of dense tissue, protecting the balloon from mechanical damage. 

Advantages of such catamarans are light weight, compactness and convenience in transportation (the whole product is packed in one pack-backpack, suitable for air traffic standards), the speed of assembly (10-15 minutes for the inflation). Landing on such a catamaran can be a raft-type, as well as a sports knee-type.
