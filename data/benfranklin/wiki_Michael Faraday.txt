'''Michael Faraday'''  [[Fellow of the Royal Society|FRS]] ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|f|ær|ə|d|eɪ|,_|-|d|i}}; 22 September 1791&nbsp;– 25 August 1867) was a British [[scientist]] who contributed to the study of [[electromagnetism]] and [[electrochemistry]]. His main discoveries include the principles underlying [[electromagnetic induction]], [[diamagnetism]] and [[electrolysis]].

Although Faraday received little formal education, he was one of the most influential scientists in history. It was by his research on the [[electromagnetic field|magnetic field]] around a [[Electrical conductor|conductor]] carrying a [[direct current]] that Faraday established the basis for the concept of the [[electromagnetic field]] in physics. Faraday also established that [[magnetism]] could affect [[Ray (optics)|rays of light]] and that there was an underlying relationship between the two phenomena.<ref name="EncBrit">{{cite EB1911|wstitle=Faraday, Michael|volume=10|pages=173–175}}. the 1911 Encyclopædia Britannica.</ref><ref name="IEEUK">{{cite web|url=http://www.theiet.org/resources/library/archives/biographies/faraday.cfm|title=Archives Michael Faraday biography – The IET|website=theiet.org}}</ref> He similarly discovered the principles of electromagnetic induction and diamagnetism, and the [[Faraday's laws of electrolysis|laws of electrolysis]]. His [[invention]]s of [[electric motor|electromagnetic rotary devices]] formed the foundation of electric motor technology, and it was largely due to his efforts that [[electricity]] became practical for use in technology.

As a chemist, Faraday discovered [[benzene]], investigated the [[clathrate hydrate]] of chlorine, invented an early form of the [[Bunsen burner]] and the system of [[oxidation number]]s, and popularised terminology such as "[[anode]]", "[[cathode]]", "[[electrode]]" and "[[ion]]". Faraday ultimately became the first and foremost [[Fullerian Professor of Chemistry]] at the [[Royal Institution]], a lifetime position.

Faraday was an excellent experimentalist who conveyed his ideas in clear and simple language; his mathematical abilities, however, did not extend as far as [[trigonometry]] and were limited to the simplest algebra. [[James Clerk Maxwell]] took the work of Faraday and others and summarized it in a set of equations which is accepted as the basis of all modern theories of electromagnetic phenomena. On Faraday's uses of [[lines of force]], Maxwell wrote that they show Faraday "to have been in reality a mathematician of a very high order – one from whom the mathematicians of the future may derive valuable and fertile methods."<ref name="MaxwellSciPapVol1">[https://books.google.com/books?id=RaqhIhxqLiwC&pg=PA360 The Scientific Papers of [[James Clerk Maxwell]] Volume 1] p. 360; Courier Dover 2003, {{ISBN|0-486-49560-4}}</ref> The [[International System of Units|SI]] unit of [[capacitance]] is named in his honour: the [[farad]].

Michael Faraday was born on 22 September 1791 in [[Newington Butts]],<ref name=ODNB/> which is now part of the [[London Borough of Southwark]] but was then a suburban part of [[Surrey]].<ref>For a concise account of Faraday's life including his childhood, see pp. 175–183 of ''[[Every Saturday]]: A Journal of Choice Reading'', Vol III published at Cambridge in 1873 by [[James R. Osgood|Osgood & Co.]]</ref>  His family was not well off. His father, James, was a member of the [[Glasite|Glassite]] sect of Christianity. James Faraday moved his wife and two children to London during the winter of 1790 from [[Outhgill]] in [[Westmorland]], where he had been an apprentice to the village blacksmith.<ref>The implication is that James discovered job opportunities elsewhere through membership of this sect. James joined the London meeting house on 20 February 1791, and moved his family shortly thereafter. See [[#Cantor|Cantor]], pp. 57–58.</ref>  Michael was born in the autumn of that year. The young Michael Faraday, who was the third of four children, having only the most basic school education, had to [[Autodidacticism|educate himself]].<ref>"Michael Faraday."  History of Science and Technology. Houghton Mifflin Company, 2004. [http://www.answers.com/topic/michael-faraday Answers.com 4 June 2007]</ref>

At the age of 14 he became an apprentice to [[George Riebau]], a local bookbinder and bookseller in Blandford Street.<ref>{{openplaque|19}}</ref> During his seven-year apprenticeship Faraday read many books, including [[Isaac Watts]]'s ''The Improvement of the Mind'', and he enthusiastically implemented the principles and suggestions contained therein.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Jenkins|first1=Alice|title=Michael Faraday's Mental Exercises: An Artisan Essay-Circle in Regency London|date=2008|publisher=Oxford University Press|page=213}}</ref> He also developed an interest in science, especially in electricity.

[[File:Faraday Cochran Pickersgill.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.85|Portrait of Faraday in his late thirties, ca. 1826]]
In 1812, at the age of 20 and at the end of his apprenticeship, Faraday attended lectures by the eminent English chemist [[Humphry Davy]] of the [[Royal Institution]] and the [[Royal Society]], and [[John Tatum (scientist)|John Tatum]], founder of the City Philosophical Society. Many of the tickets for these lectures were given to Faraday by [[William Dance]], who was one of the founders of the [[Royal Philharmonic Society]]. Faraday subsequently sent Davy a 300-page book based on notes that he had taken during these lectures. Davy's reply was immediate, kind, and favourable. In 1813, when Davy damaged his eyesight in an accident with [[nitrogen trichloride]], he decided to employ Faraday as an assistant. Coincidentally one of the Royal Institution's assistants, John Payne, was sacked and Sir Humphry Davy had been asked to find a replacement; thus he appointed Faraday as Chemical Assistant at the Royal Institution on 1 March 1813.<ref name="EncBrit"/> Very soon Davy entrusted Faraday with the preparation of nitrogen trichloride samples, and they both were injured in an explosion of this very sensitive substance.<ref>[[#Thomas|Thomas]], p. 17</ref>

[[File:Faraday-Millikan-Gale-1913.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.85|Michael Faraday, c. 1861, aged about 70.]]
In the class-based English society of the time, Faraday was not considered a [[gentleman]]. When Davy set out on a long tour of the continent in 1813–15, his [[valet]] did not wish to go, so instead, Faraday went as Davy's scientific assistant and was asked to act as Davy's valet until a replacement could be found in Paris. Faraday was forced to fill the role of valet as well as assistant throughout the trip. Davy's wife, Jane Apreece, refused to treat Faraday as an equal (making him travel outside the coach, eat with the servants, etc.), and made Faraday so miserable that he contemplated returning to England alone and giving up science altogether. The trip did, however, give him access to the scientific elite of Europe and exposed him to a host of stimulating ideas.<ref name="EncBrit"/>

Faraday married Sarah Barnard (1800–1879) on 12 June 1821.<ref>The register at St. Faith-in-the-Virgin near [[St. Paul's Cathedral]], records 12 June as the date their licence was issued. The witness was Sarah's father, Edward. Their marriage was 16 years prior to the Marriage and Registration Act of 1837. See [[#Cantor|Cantor]], p. 59.</ref> They met through their families at the [[Sandemanian]] church, and he confessed his faith to the Sandemanian congregation the month after they were married. They had no children.<ref name=ODNB>{{cite ODNB|id=9153|title=Faraday, Michael (1791–1867)|origyear=2004|year=2011|last=James|first=Frank A. J. L.}}</ref>

Faraday was a devout Christian; his Sandemanian denomination was an offshoot of the [[Church of Scotland]]. Well after his marriage, he served as [[deacon]] and for two terms as an [[Elder (Christianity)|elder]] in the meeting house of his youth. His church was located at Paul's Alley in the [[Barbican Estate|Barbican]]. This meeting house relocated in 1862 to [[Barnsbury]] Grove, [[London Borough of Islington|Islington]]; this North London location was where Faraday served the final two years of his second term as elder prior to his resignation from that post.<ref>[[#Cantor|Cantor]], pp. 41–43, 60–64, and 277–280.</ref><ref>Paul's Alley was located 10 houses south of the [[Barbican Estate|Barbican]]. See p. 330 [[James Elmes|Elmes]]'s (1831) ''Topographical Dictionary of the British Metropolis''.</ref>  Biographers have noted that "a strong sense of the unity of God and nature pervaded Faraday's life and work."<ref>{{Cite journal| author=Baggott, Jim | title = The myth of Michael Faraday: Michael Faraday was not just one of Britain's greatest experimenters.

Having provided a number of various service projects for the British government, when asked by the government to advise on the production of chemical weapons for use in the [[Crimean War]] (1853–1856), Faraday refused to participate citing ethical reasons.<ref name="Croddy">{{Cite book|last1=Croddy|first1=Eric|last2=Wirtz|first2=James J.|title=Weapons of Mass Destruction: An Encyclopedia of Worldwide Policy, Technology, and History|publisher=[[ABC-CLIO]]|url=https://books.google.com/?id=ZzlNgS70OHAC&pg=PA86&lpg=PA86&dq=Faraday++chemical+weapons+Crimean+War|year=2005|page= 86|isbn=978-1-85109-490-5}}</ref>

Faraday died at his house at [[Hampton Court]] on 25 August 1867, aged 75.<ref>{{openplaque|2429}}</ref> He had some years before turned down an offer of burial in [[Westminster Abbey]] upon his death, but he has a memorial plaque there, near [[Isaac Newton]]'s tomb.

===Chemistry===
[[File:Ri 2014 - glass making - Faraday.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.85|Equipment used by Faraday to make glass on display at the [[Royal Institution]] in London]]
Faraday's earliest chemical work was as an assistant to [[Humphry Davy]]. Faraday was specifically involved in the study of [[chlorine]]; he discovered two new compounds of chlorine and [[carbon]]. He also conducted the first rough experiments on the diffusion of gases, a phenomenon that was first pointed out by [[John Dalton]]. The physical importance of this phenomenon was more fully revealed by [[Thomas Graham (chemist)|Thomas Graham]] and [[Joseph Loschmidt]]. Faraday succeeded in liquefying several gases, investigated the alloys of steel, and produced several new kinds of glass intended for optical purposes. A specimen of one of these heavy glasses subsequently became historically important; when the glass was placed in a magnetic field Faraday determined the rotation of the plane of polarisation of light. This specimen was also the first substance found to be repelled by the poles of a magnet.

Faraday invented an early form of what was to become the [[Bunsen burner]], which is in practical use in science laboratories around the world as a convenient source of heat.<ref>{{Cite journal| last =Jensen  | first =William B. |doi=10.1021/ed082p518 | title =The Origin of the Bunsen Burner | journal=[[Journal of Chemical Education]]  | volume = 82  | issue = 4 | page =518 | year =2005  | url = http://jchemed.chem.wisc.edu/HS/Journal/Issues/2005/Apr/clicSubscriber/V82N04/p518.pdf|bibcode = 2005JChEd..82..518J }}</ref><ref>[[#Faraday1827|Faraday (1827)]], p. 127.</ref>
Faraday worked extensively in the field of chemistry, discovering chemical substances such as [[benzene]] (which he called bicarburet of hydrogen) and liquefying gases such as chlorine. The liquefying of gases helped to establish that gases are the vapours of liquids possessing a very low boiling point and gave a more solid basis to the concept of molecular aggregation. In 1820 Faraday reported the first synthesis of compounds made from carbon and chlorine, [[hexachloroethane|C<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>6</sub>]] and [[tetrachloroethylene|C<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>4</sub>]], and published his results the following year.<ref>{{Cite journal| author=Faraday, Michael | title = On two new Compounds of Chlorine and Carbon, and on a new Compound of Iodine, Carbon, and Hydrogen | journal=Philosophical Transactions | year = 1821 | volume = 111| pages = 47–74 | doi = 10.1098/rstl.1821.0007 }}</ref><ref>{{Cite book| last = Faraday | first = Michael | title = Experimental Researches in Chemistry and Physics | publisher=[[Richard Taylor and William Francis]] | year= 1859 | location = London | pages = 33–53| isbn = 978-0-85066-841-4}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book| last = Williams | first = L.

Faraday was the first to report what later came to be called metallic [[nanoparticles]]. In 1847 he discovered that the optical properties of gold [[colloid]]s differed from those of the corresponding bulk metal. This was probably the first reported observation of the effects of [[quantum]] size, and might be considered to be the birth of [[nanoscience]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.nanogallery.info/nanogallery/?ipg=126 |title=The Birth of Nanotechnology |accessdate=25 July 2007 |year=2006 |publisher=Nanogallery.info |quote="Faraday made some attempt to explain what was causing the vivid coloration in his gold mixtures, saying that known phenomena seemed to indicate that a mere variation in the size of gold particles gave rise to a variety of resultant colors." }}</ref>

===Electricity and magnetism===
Faraday is best known for his work regarding electricity and magnetism. His first recorded experiment was the construction of a [[voltaic pile]] with seven [[Halfpenny (British pre-decimal coin)|ha'penny]] coins, stacked together with seven disks of sheet zinc, and six pieces of paper moistened with salt water. With this pile he decomposed [[Magnesium sulfate|sulfate of magnesia]] (first letter to Abbott, 12 July 1812).
[[File:Faraday magnetic rotation.jpg|thumb|left|Electromagnetic rotation experiment of Faraday, ''ca.'' 1821<ref>{{Cite book| author=Faraday, Michael | title = Experimental Researches in Electricity | year = 1844 | volume = 2| isbn = 978-0-486-43505-3 }} See plate 4.</ref>]]
In 1821, soon after the Danish physicist and chemist [[Hans Christian Ørsted]] discovered the phenomenon of [[electromagnetism]], Davy and British scientist [[William Hyde Wollaston]] tried, but failed, to design an [[electric motor]].<ref name="IEEUK"/> Faraday, having discussed the problem with the two men, went on to build two devices to produce what he called "electromagnetic rotation". One of these, now known as the [[homopolar motor]], caused a continuous circular motion that was engendered by the circular magnetic force around a wire that extended into a pool of [[mercury (element)|mercury]] wherein was placed a magnet; the wire would then rotate around the magnet if supplied with current from a chemical battery. These experiments and inventions formed the foundation of modern electromagnetic technology. In his excitement, Faraday published results without acknowledging his work with either Wollaston or Davy. The resulting controversy within the [[Royal Society]] strained his mentor relationship with Davy and may well have contributed to Faraday's assignment to other activities, which consequently prevented his involvement in electromagnetic research for several years.<ref>[[#Hamilton|Hamilton]], pp. 165–171, 183, 187–190.</ref><ref>[[#Cantor|Cantor]], pp. 231–233.</ref>

When it is moved in or out of the large coil ''(B)'', its magnetic field induces a momentary voltage in the coil, which is detected by the galvanometer ''(G)''.]]
From his initial discovery in 1821, Faraday continued his laboratory work, exploring electromagnetic properties of materials and developing requisite experience. In 1824, Faraday briefly set up a circuit to study whether a magnetic field could regulate the flow of a current in an adjacent wire, but he found no such relationship.<ref>[[#Thompson|Thompson]], p. 95.</ref> This experiment followed similar work conducted with light and magnets three years earlier that yielded identical results.<ref>[[#Thompson|Thompson]], p. 91.

His work was heavily influenced by the ongoing research of fellow European scientists Ampere, Arago, and Oersted as indicated by his diary entries. [[#Cantor|Cantor]], pp. 235–244.</ref> Two years after the death of Davy, in 1831, he began his great series of experiments in which he discovered [[electromagnetic induction]], recording in his laboratory diary on 28 October 1831 he was; "making many experiments with the great magnet of the Royal Society".<ref>Gooding, David; Pinch, Trevor; Schaffer, Simon (1989).

[[File:Faraday disk generator.jpg|thumb|left|Built in 1831, the [[Faraday disk]] was the first [[electric generator]]. The horseshoe-shaped magnet ''(A)'' created a magnetic field through the disk ''(D)''. When the disk was turned, this induced an electric current radially outward from the center toward the rim.  The current flowed out through the sliding spring contact ''m'', through the external circuit, and back into the center of the disk through the axle.]]
Faraday's breakthrough came when he wrapped two insulated coils of wire around an iron ring, and found that upon passing a current through one coil a momentary current was induced in the other coil.<ref name="IEEUK"/> This phenomenon is now known as [[mutual induction]].<ref>Van Valkenburgh (1995). ''Basic Electricity''. Cengage Learning. {{ISBN|0-7906-1041-8}}. pp.&nbsp;4–91.</ref> The iron ring-coil apparatus is still on display at the Royal Institution. In subsequent experiments, he found that if he moved a magnet through a loop of wire an electric current flowed in that wire. The current also flowed if the loop was moved over a stationary magnet. His demonstrations established that a changing magnetic field produces an electric field; this relation was modelled mathematically by [[James Clerk Maxwell]] as [[Faraday's law of induction|Faraday's law]], which subsequently became one of the four [[Maxwell's equations|Maxwell equations]], and which have in turn evolved into the generalization known today as [[Field theory (physics)|field theory]].<ref name="Pioneers"/> Faraday would later use the principles he had discovered to construct the electric [[Electrical generator#Dynamo|dynamo]], the ancestor of modern power generators and the electric motor.<ref>{{cite news|title=Michael Faraday's generator|url=http://www.rigb.org/our-history/iconic-objects/iconic-objects-list/faraday-generator|publisher=The Royal Institution|date=15 October 2017}}</ref>
[[File:Faraday and Daniell 1849 RGNb10408769 f85.tif|thumb|right|Faraday ([[relative direction|right]]) and [[John Frederic Daniell|John Daniell]] ([[relative direction|left]]), founders of electrochemistry.]]
In 1832, he completed a series of experiments aimed at investigating the fundamental nature of electricity; Faraday used "[[Electrostatics|static]]", [[Battery (electricity)|batteries]], and "[[Bioelectromagnetism|animal electricity]]" to produce the phenomena of electrostatic attraction, [[electrolysis]], [[Electromagnetism|magnetism]], etc. He concluded that, contrary to the scientific opinion of the time, the divisions between the various "kinds" of electricity were illusory. Faraday instead proposed that only a single "electricity" exists, and the changing values of quantity and intensity (current and voltage) would produce different groups of phenomena.<ref name="IEEUK"/>

Near the end of his career, Faraday proposed that electromagnetic forces extended into the empty space around the conductor.<ref name="Pioneers">{{cite book|title=Lives and Times of Great Pioneers in Chemistry (lavoisier to Sanger)|date=2015|publisher=World Scientific|pages=85, 86}}</ref> This idea was rejected by his fellow scientists, and Faraday did not live to see the eventual acceptance of his proposition by the scientific community. Faraday's concept of lines of flux emanating from charged bodies and magnets provided a way to visualize electric and magnetic fields; that conceptual model was crucial for the successful development of the electromechanical devices that dominated engineering and industry for the remainder of the 19th century.

===Diamagnetism===
[[File:Faraday photograph ii.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Faraday holding a type of glass bar he used in 1845 to show magnetism affects light in [[dielectric]] material.<ref>{{cite web|title=Detail of an engraving by Henry Adlard, based on earlier photograph by Maull & Polyblank ''ca.'' 1857|url=http://www.npg.org.uk/live/search/person.asp?LinkID=mp01529|publisher=[[NPR]]|location=National Portrait Gallery, UK}}</ref>]]
In 1845, Faraday discovered that many materials exhibit a weak repulsion from a magnetic field: a phenomenon he termed [[diamagnetism]].<ref>James, Frank A.J.L (2010). ''Michael Faraday: A Very Short Introduction''. Oxford University Press. {{ISBN|0-19-161446-7}}. p. 81.</ref>

Faraday also discovered that the plane of [[Polarization (waves)|polarization]] of linearly polarized light can be rotated by the application of an external magnetic field aligned with the direction in which the light is moving. This is now termed the [[Faraday effect]].<ref name="Pioneers"/> In Sept 1845 he wrote in his notebook, "I have at last succeeded in ''illuminating a magnetic curve'' or ''[[line of force]]'' and in ''magnetising a [[Ray (optics)|ray of light]]''".<ref>Day, Peter (1999). ''The Philosopher's Tree: A Selection of Michael Faraday's Writings''. CRC Press. {{ISBN|0-7503-0570-3}}. p. 125.</ref>

Later on in his life, in 1862, Faraday used a spectroscope to search for a different alteration of light, the change of spectral lines by an applied magnetic field. The equipment available to him was, however, insufficient for a definite determination of spectral change. [[Pieter Zeeman]] later used an improved apparatus to study the same phenomenon, publishing his results in 1897 and receiving the 1902 Nobel Prize in Physics for his success. In both his 1897 paper<ref>{{Cite journal| title = The Effect of Magnetisation on the Nature of Light Emitted by a Substance | journal=[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]  | year = 1897 | volume = 55 | page = 347 | author=Zeeman, Pieter | doi = 10.1038/055347a0|bibcode = 1897Natur..55..347Z | issue=1424}}</ref> and his Nobel acceptance speech,<ref>{{Cite web| title = Pieter Zeeman, Nobel Lecture | url = http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1902/zeeman-lecture.html | accessdate =29 May 2008}}</ref> Zeeman made reference to Faraday's work.

===Faraday cage===
In his work on static electricity, [[Faraday's ice pail experiment]] demonstrated that the charge resided only on the exterior of a charged conductor, and exterior charge had no influence on anything enclosed within a conductor. This is because the exterior charges redistribute such that the interior fields emanating from them cancel one another. This shielding effect is used in what is now known as a [[Faraday cage]].<ref name="Pioneers"/>

==Royal Institution and public service==
[[File:FaradayFatherThames.jpg|thumb|Michael Faraday meets [[Father Thames]], from ''[[Punch (magazine)|Punch]]'' (21 July 1855)]]

Faraday had a long association with the [[Royal Institution of Great Britain]].  He was appointed Assistant Superintendent of the House of the Royal Institution in 1821.<ref name=RIBiography>{{cite web|title=Michael Faraday (1791–1867)|url=http://www.rigb.org/our-history/people/f/michael-faraday|publisher=The Royal Institution|accessdate=20 February 2014}}</ref>  He was elected a member of the [[Royal Society]] in 1824.<ref name=ODNB/> In 1825, he became Director of the Laboratory of the Royal Institution.<ref name=RIBiography />  Six years later, in 1833, Faraday became the first [[Fullerian Professor of Chemistry]] at the [[Royal Institution of Great Britain]], a position to which he was appointed for life without the obligation to deliver lectures. His sponsor and mentor was [[John 'Mad Jack' Fuller]], who created the position at the Royal Institution for Faraday.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Jones|first1=Roger|title=What's Who?: A Dictionary of Things Named After People and the People They are Named After|date=2009|publisher=Troubador Publishing Ltd|page=74}}</ref>

Beyond his scientific research into areas such as chemistry, electricity, and magnetism at the [[Royal Institution]], Faraday undertook numerous, and often time-consuming, service projects for private enterprise and the British government. This work included investigations of explosions in coal mines, being an [[expert witness]] in court, and along with two engineers from [[Chance Brothers]] c.1853, the preparation of high-quality optical glass, which was required by Chance for its lighthouses. In 1846, together with [[Charles Lyell]], he produced a lengthy and detailed report on a serious [[explosion]] in the colliery at [[Haswell, County Durham]], which killed 95 miners. Their report was a meticulous [[forensic investigation]] and indicated that [[coal dust]] contributed to the severity of the explosion. The report should have warned coal owners of the hazard of coal dust explosions, but the risk was ignored for over 60 years until the [[Senghenydd Colliery Disaster]] of 1913.
[[File:Lighthouse lantern room with Fresnel lens.png|thumb|left|Lighthouse lantern room from mid-1800s]]
As a respected scientist in a nation with strong maritime interests, Faraday spent extensive amounts of time on projects such as the construction and operation of [[lighthouse]]s and protecting the bottoms of ships from [[corrosion]]. His workshop still stands at [[Trinity Buoy Wharf]] above the Chain and Buoy Store, next to London's only lighthouse where he carried out the first experiments in electric lighting for lighthouses.<ref>Smith, Denis (2001). ''London and the Thames Valley''. Thomas Telford. {{ISBN|0-7277-2876-8}}. p. 236.</ref>

Faraday was also active in what would now be called [[environmental science]], or engineering. He investigated industrial pollution at [[Swansea]] and was consulted on air pollution at the [[Royal Mint]]. In July 1855, Faraday wrote a letter to ''[[The Times]]'' on the subject of the foul condition of the [[River Thames]], which resulted in an often-reprinted cartoon in ''[[Punch (magazine)|Punch]]''. (See also [[The Great Stink]]).<ref>Faraday, Michael (9 July 1855). "The State of the Thames". The Times. p. 8.</ref>

Faraday assisted with the planning and judging of exhibits for the [[Great Exhibition]] of 1851 in London. He also advised the [[National Gallery, London|National Gallery]] on the cleaning and protection of its art collection, and served on the National Gallery Site Commission in 1857.<ref>{{London Gazette|issue=21950|page=4219|date=16 December 1856}}</ref><ref>[[#Thomas|Thomas]], p. 83</ref>

Education was another of Faraday's areas of service; he lectured on the topic in 1854 at the Royal Institution,<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/scienceeducation00roya|title=Science and education; lectures delivered at the Royal institution of Great Britain|last=Royal Institution of Great Britain|last2=Whewell|first2=William|last3=Faraday|first3=Michael|last4=Latham|first4=Robert Gordon|last5=Daubeny|first5=Charles|last6=Tyndall|first6=John|last7=Paget|first7=James|last8=Hodgson|first8=William Ballantyne|last9=Lankester|first9=E.

[[File:Faraday Michael Christmas lecture.jpg|thumb|Michael Faraday delivering a [[Christmas Lecture]] at the [[Royal Institution]] in 1856.]]

Before his famous Christmas lectures, Faraday delivered chemistry lectures for the City Philosophical Society from 1816 to 1818 in order to refine the quality of his lectures.<ref>{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1119/1.1343427| title = Michael Faraday: Prince of lecturers in Victorian England| journal = The Physics Teacher| volume = 39| issue = 1| pages = 32–36| year = 2001| last1 = Lan | first1 = B.L. |bibcode = 2001PhTea..39...32L }}</ref> Between 1827 and 1860 at the [[Royal Institution]] in London, Faraday gave a series of nineteen [[Royal Institution Christmas Lectures|Christmas lectures]] for young people, a series which continues today. The objective of Faraday's Christmas lectures was to present science to the general public in the hopes of inspiring them and generating revenue for the Royal Institution. They were notable events on the social calendar among London's gentry. Over the course of several letters to his close friend Benjamin Abbott, Faraday outlined his recommendations on the art of lecturing: Faraday wrote "a flame should be lighted at the commencement and kept alive with unremitting splendour to the end".<ref>Hirshfeld, Alan (2006). ''The Electric Life of Michael Faraday''. New York: Walker & Company. {{ISBN|0-8027-1470-6}}</ref> His lectures were joyful and juvenile, he delighted in filling soap bubbles with various gasses (in order to determine whether or not they are magnetic) in front of his audiences and marveled at the rich colors of polarized lights, but the lectures were also deeply philosophical. In his lectures he urged his audiences to consider the mechanics of his experiments: "you know very well that ice floats upon water&nbsp;... Why does the ice float? Think of that, and philosophise".<ref>{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1063/1.3035100| title = Michael Faraday and the Art of Lecturing| journal = Physics Today| volume = 21| issue = 8| pages = 30–38| year = 1968| last1 = Seeger | first1 = R.J. | bibcode = 1968PhT....21h..30S}}</ref> His subjects consisted of Chemistry and Electricity, and included: 1841 The Rudiments of Chemistry, 1843 First Principles of Electricity, 1848 [[The Chemical History of a Candle]], 1851 Attractive Forces, 1853 Voltaic Electricity, 1854 The Chemistry of Combustion, 1855 The Distinctive Properties of the Common Metals, 1857 Static Electricity, 1858 The Metallic Properties, 1859 The Various Forces of Matter and their Relations to Each Other.<ref>{{cite web|title=History of the Christmas Lectures|url=http://www.rigb.org/christmas-lectures/history|publisher=The Royal Institution|accessdate=16 October 2017}}</ref>

[[File:Michael Faraday statue AB.jpg|thumb|Michael Faraday statue in [[Savoy Place]], London. Sculptor [[John Henry Foley]] RA.]]

A statue of Faraday stands in [[Savoy Place]], London, outside the [[Institution of Engineering and Technology]]. Also in London, the [[Michael Faraday Memorial]], designed by [[brutalist]] architect [[Rodney Gordon]] and completed in 1961, is at the [[Elephant & Castle]] gyratory system, near Faraday's birthplace at [[Newington Butts]]. Faraday School is located on [[Trinity Buoy Wharf]] where his workshop still stands above the Chain and Buoy Store, next to London's only lighthouse.<ref>Fisher, Stuart (2012).

Faraday Gardens is a small park in [[Walworth]], London, not far from his birthplace at [[Newington Butts]]. This park lies within the local council ward of Faraday in the [[London Borough of Southwark]]. Michael Faraday Primary school is situated on the [[Aylesbury Estate]] in [[Walworth]].<ref>[http://michaelfaradayschool.co.uk/about_us/ Michael Faraday Primary School] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120329005025/http://michaelfaradayschool.co.uk/about_us/ |date=29 March 2012 }}. michaelfaradayschool.co.uk</ref>

A building at [[London South Bank University]], which houses the institute's electrical engineering departments is named the Faraday Wing, due to its proximity to Faraday's birthplace in [[Newington Butts]]. A hall at [[Loughborough University]] was named after Faraday in 1960. Near the entrance to its dining hall is a bronze casting, which depicts the symbol of an electrical [[transformer]], and inside there hangs a portrait, both in Faraday's honour. An eight-story building at the [[University of Edinburgh]]'s science & engineering campus is named for Faraday, as is a recently built hall of accommodation at [[Brunel University]], the main engineering building at [[Swansea University]], and the instructional and experimental physics building at [[Northern Illinois University]]. The former UK Faraday Station in [[Antarctica]] was named after him.<ref>[http://www.antarctica.ac.uk/about_bas/our_history/stations_and_refuges/faraday.php Faraday Station F — History]. antarctica.ac.uk</ref>

The [[Faraday Institute for Science and Religion]] derives its name from the scientist, who saw his faith as integral to his scientific research. The logo of the Institute is also based on Faraday's discoveries. It was created in 2006 by a $2,000,000 [[Grant (money)|grant]] from the [[John Templeton Foundation]] to carry out academic research, to foster understanding of the interaction between science and religion, and to engage public understanding in both these subject areas.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.templeton.org/what-we-fund/grants/faraday-institute-for-science-and-religion-interdisciplinary-research-and-projec|title=Faraday Institute for Science and Religion: Interdisciplinary Research and Projects|website=templeton.org|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120111173539/http://www.templeton.org/what-we-fund/grants/faraday-institute-for-science-and-religion-interdisciplinary-research-and-projec|archivedate=11 January 2012|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref>[http://www.st-edmunds.cam.ac.uk/faraday/Institute.php About us] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091213214256/http://www.st-edmunds.cam.ac.uk/faraday/Institute.php |date=13 December 2009 }}, Faraday Institute</ref>
