A '''candle''' is an ignitable [[candle wick|wick]] embedded in [[wax]], or another flammable solid substance such as [[tallow]], that provides [[light]], and in some cases, a [[Aroma compound|fragrance]].  A candle can also provide [[heat]], or be used as a method of keeping [[time]]. The candle can be used during the event of a [[power outage]] to provide [[light]].

A person who makes candles is traditionally known as a [[chandlery|chandler]].<ref>{{cite web| url= http://www.thefreedictionary.com/chandler|title=Chandler |publisher=The Free Dictionary By Farlex|accessdate=2012-05-19}}</ref> Various devices have been invented to hold candles, from simple tabletop [[candlestick|candlesticks, also known as candle holders,]] to elaborate [[chandelier]]s.<ref>{{cite web| url= http://www.thefreedictionary.com/chandelier |title=chandelier |publisher=The Free Dictionary By Farlex|accessdate=2012-05-19}}</ref>

For a candle to burn, a heat source (commonly a naked flame) is used to light the candle's wick, which melts and [[vaporizes]] a small amount of fuel (the wax). Once vaporized, the fuel combines with [[oxygen]] in the atmosphere to ignite and form a constant [[flame]]. This flame provides sufficient heat to keep the candle burning via a self-sustaining chain of events: the heat of the flame melts the top of the mass of solid fuel; the liquefied fuel then moves upward through the wick via [[capillary action]]; the liquefied fuel finally vaporizes to burn within the candle's flame.

As the solid fuel (wax) is melted and burned, the candle becomes shorter. Portions of the wick that are not emitting vaporized fuel are consumed in the flame. The incineration of the wick limits the exposed length of the wick, thus maintaining a constant burning temperature and rate of fuel consumption. Some wicks require regular trimming with scissors (or a specialized [[wick trimmer]]), usually to about one-quarter inch (~0.7&nbsp;cm), to promote slower, steady burning, and also to prevent smoking. Special candle-scissors called "[[Candle snuffer|snuffers]]" were produced for this purpose in the 20th century and were often combined with an extinguisher. In modern candles, the wick is constructed so that it curves over as it burns.  This ensures that the end of the wick gets oxygen and is then consumed by [[fire]]—a self-trimming wick.<ref>[http://www.eca-candles.com/design.php?rubrik=29&topnav=6&sprach_id=en&SID=ksqhyfiz European Candle Association FAQ].</ref>

==Etymology==
The word candle comes from Middle English ''candel'', from Old English and from Anglo-Norman ''candele'', both from Latin ''candēla'', from ''candēre'', to shine.<ref name=Farlex>{{cite web| url= http://www.thefreedictionary.com/candle |title=Candle |publisher=The Free Dictionary By Farlex|accessdate=2012-05-19}}</ref>

==History==
{{Main|History of candle making}}

Prior to the candle, people used [[oil lamp]]s in which a lit wick rested in a container of liquid oil. Liquid oil lamps had a tendency to spill, and the wick had to be advanced by hand.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}} [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] began making true dipped candles from tallow, beginning around 500 BC.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.smith.edu/hsc/museum/ancient_inventions/candles2.html |title=Candles, Roman, 500 BCE |website=Smith College Museum}}</ref> European candles of antiquity were made from various forms of natural fat, tallow, and wax. In [[Ancient Rome]], candles were made of tallow due to the prohibitive cost of beeswax.<ref name=Forbes>{{cite book|last1=Forbes|first1=R J|title=Studies in Ancient technology|date=1955|isbn=978-9004006263|pages=139–40|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-VmmHdm5STIC|accessdate=7 November 2014}}</ref> It is possible that they also existed in [[Ancient Greece]], but imprecise terminology makes it difficult to determine.<ref name=Forbes /> The earliest surviving candles originated in [[Han China]] around 200 BC. These early Chinese candles were made from whale fat.

During the Middle Ages, [[tallow]] candles were most commonly used. By the 13th century, candle making had become a guild craft in England and France. The candle makers (chandlers) went from house to house making candles from the kitchen fats saved for that purpose, or made and sold their own candles from small candle shops.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.candles.org/about_history.html |title=History of candles |publisher=National Candle Association |accessdate=2012-05-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120517112023/http://www.candles.org/about_history.html |archivedate=May 17, 2012 }}</ref> Beeswax, compared to animal-based tallow, burned cleanly, without smoky flame. Beeswax candles were expensive, and relatively few people could afford to burn them in their homes in medieval Europe. However, they were widely used for church ceremonies.<ref>{{cite web|title=history of candle|url=http://candles.org/history/|publisher=national candle association}}</ref>

In the 18th and 19th centuries, [[spermaceti]], a waxy substance produced by the [[sperm whale]], was used to produce a superior candle that burned longer, brighter and gave off no offensive smell.<ref>{{cite book | last = Shillito | first = M.

===Modern era===
[[File:Price's Palmitine Candles00.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|[[Price's Candles]] became the largest candle manufacturer in the world by the end of the 19th century]]

The manufacture of candles became an industrialized mass market in the mid 19th century. In 1834, Joseph Morgan,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gracesguide.co.uk/Joseph_Morgan_and_Son|title=Joseph Morgan and Son |publisher=Graces Guide}}</ref> a [[pewter]]er from [[Manchester]], England, patented a machine that revolutionised candle making. It allowed for continuous production of molded candles by using a cylinder with a moveable piston to eject candles as they solidified. This more efficient mechanized production produced about 1,500 candles per hour. This allowed candles to be an affordable commodity for the masses.<ref>{{cite book | last = Phillips | first = Gordon  | title = Seven Centuries of Light: The Tallow Chandlers Company | publisher = Book Production Consultants  | year = 1999 | url = https://books.google.com/?id=OWt03_on0qUC&pg=PA74&dq=Joseph+Morgan+candles+1834 | isbn = 1-85757-064-2 | page = 74}}</ref> Candlemakers also began to fashion wicks out of tightly [[braid]]ed (rather than simply twisted) strands of [[cotton]]. This technique makes wicks curl over as they burn, maintaining the height of the wick and therefore the flame. Because much of the excess wick is incinerated, these are referred to as "self-trimming" or "self-consuming" wicks.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.expressivecandles.com/history.php# |title=A Brief History of Candles |access-date=2015-07-06 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130318072713/http://www.expressivecandles.com/history.php# |archive-date=2013-03-18 |dead-url=yes |df= }}</ref>

In the mid-1850s, [[James Young (Scottish chemist)|James Young]] succeeded in distilling [[paraffin wax]] from coal and oil shales at [[Bathgate]] in [[West Lothian]] and developed a commercially viable method of production.<ref>{{cite book | last = Golan | first = Tal  | title = Laws of Men and Laws of Nature: The History of Scientific Expert Testimony in England and America | publisher = Harvard University Press | year = 2004 | pages = 89–91 | url = https://books.google.com/?id=kQhYsAmcj-EC&pg=PA90&dq=james+young+patent+paraffin#PPA90,M1  | isbn = 0674012860}}</ref> Paraffin could be used to make inexpensive candles of high quality. It was a bluish-white wax, which burned cleanly and left no unpleasant odor, unlike [[tallow]] candles. By the end of the 19th century candles were made from paraffin wax and [[stearic acid]].

By the late 19th century, [[Price's Candles]], based in London, was the largest candle manufacturer in the world.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fJo7AwAAQBAJ|title=London's Industrial Heritage|author=Geoff Marshall|year=2013|publisher=The History Press|isbn=9780752492391}}</ref> Founded by William Wilson in 1830,<ref>{{cite book | last = Ball  | first = Michael  |author2=David Sunderland | title = An Economic History of London, 1800-1914 | publisher = Routledge | year = 2001 | pages = 131–132 | url = https://books.google.com/?id=MI6JfTiEcdAC&pg=PA132&dq=Prices+Candles+Coconut | isbn = 0415246911}}</ref> the company pioneered the implementation of the technique of [[steam distillation]], and was thus able to manufacture candles from a wide range of raw materials, including skin fat, bone fat, fish oil and industrial greases.

Despite advances in candle making, the candle industry declined rapidly upon the introduction of superior methods of lighting, including [[kerosene]] and [[Kerosene lamp|lamps]] and the 1879 invention of the [[incandescent light bulb]]. From this point on, candles came to be marketed as more of a decorative item.

Before the invention of [[electric light]]ing, candles and oil lamps were commonly used for illumination. In areas without electricity, they are still used routinely.  Until the 20th century, candles were more common in northern Europe. In southern Europe and the Mediterranean, oil lamps predominated.

In the developed world today, candles are used mainly for their aesthetic value and scent, particularly to set a soft, warm, or romantic ambiance, for emergency lighting during electrical [[power failure]]s, and for religious or ritual purposes.

===Other uses===
With the fairly consistent and measurable burning of a candle, a common use of candles was to tell the [[candle clock|time]]. The candle designed for this purpose might have time measurements, usually in hours, marked along the wax. The [[Song dynasty]] in China (960–1279) used [[candle clock]]s.<ref>{{cite book|last=Whitrow |first=G. J. |title=Time in History: Views of Time from Prehistory to the Present Day |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=1989 |pages=90–91 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=o8Nb5KLBxVQC&pg=PA91&dq=Sung+dynasty+incense+clocks#PPA91,M1 |isbn=0-19-285211-6 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150610204616/https://books.google.com/books?id=o8Nb5KLBxVQC&pg=PA91&dq=Sung+dynasty+incense+clocks |archivedate=June 10, 2015 }}</ref>

By the 18th century, candle clocks were being made with weights set into the sides of the candle. As the candle melted, the weights fell off and made a noise as they fell into a bowl.

In the days leading to Christmas some people burn a candle a set amount to represent each day, as marked on the candle. The type of candle used in this way is called the ''[[Advent candle]]'',<ref>{{cite book | last = Geddes | first = Gordon  |author2=Jane Griffiths | title = Christianity | publisher = Heinemann | page = 89 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=Wn-38NunUnAC&pg=PT98&dq=advent+candle#PPT98,M1 | isbn = 0-435-30693-6| year = 2002  }}</ref> although this term is also used to refer to a candle that decorates an [[Advent wreath]].

==Components==

===Wax===
[[File:Hentriacontane.svg|thumb|The hydrocarbon [[Hentriacontane|C<sub>31</sub>H<sub>64</sub>]] is a typical component of paraffin wax, from which most modern candles are produced.]]
[[File:7candles.JPG|thumb|upright|Unlit candles]]
[[File:Candles (Christmas 2009).jpg|thumb|Candles for Christmas.]]
For most of recorded history candles were made from [[tallow]] (rendered from beef or mutton-fat) or [[beeswax]]. From the mid 1800s they were also made from [[spermaceti]], a waxy substance derived from the [[Sperm whale]], which in turn spurred demand for the substance. Candles were also made from [[stearin]] (initially manufactured from animal fats but now produced almost exclusively from palm waxes).<ref>{{cite web|title=Using stearic acid or stearin in candlemaking|url=http://www.happynews.com/living/create/using-stearic-acid.htm|website=happynews.com|accessdate=25 September 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Stearic acid (stearin)|url=http://www.howtomakecandles.info/cm_article.asp?ID=ADDIT0003|website=howtomakecandles.info|accessdate=25 September 2014}}</ref> Today, most candles are made from [[paraffin wax]], a product of [[petroleum]] refining.<ref name= Ullmann>Franz Willhöft and Fredrick Horn "Candles" in Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry, 2000, Wiley-VCH, Weinheim. {{DOI|10.1002/14356007.a05_029}}</ref>

Candles can also be made from [[microcrystalline wax]], [[beeswax]] (a byproduct of [[honey collection]]), [[gel]] (a mixture of [[polymer]] and [[mineral oil]]),<ref>{{cite journal|last=Camp|first=William R.|last2=Vollenweider |first2=Jeffrey L. |last3=Schutz |first3= Wendy J. |title=Scented candle gel|journal=United States Patent 5,964,905|date=12 October 1999}}</ref> or some [[Wax#Plant waxes|plant waxes]] (generally palm, [[carnauba wax|carnauba]], [[bayberry]], or [[soybean wax]]).

The size of the flame and corresponding rate of burning is controlled largely by the [[candle wick]].

Production methods utilize [[extrusion moulding]].<ref name= Ullmann/> More traditional production methods entail [[melting]] the solid fuel by the controlled application of heat. The liquid is then poured into a mould or a wick is repeatedly immersed in the liquid to create a dipped tapered candle. Often [[fragrance oil]]s, [[essential oil]]s or [[aniline]]-based [[dye]] is added.

===Wick===
{{main|Candle wick}}

A candle wick works by [[capillary action]], drawing ("wicking") the melted wax or [[fuel]] up to the flame. When the liquid fuel reaches the flame, it [[vaporize]]s and [[Combustion|combusts]]. The candle wick influences how the candle burns.  Important characteristics of the wick include diameter, stiffness, [[Fireproofing|fire-resistance]], and tethering.

A candle wick is a piece of string or cord that holds the flame of a candle.  Commercial wicks are made from braided cotton.  The wick's [[capillary action|capillarity]] determines the rate at which the melted hydrocarbon is conveyed to the flame.  If the capillarity is too great, the molten wax streams down the side of the candle.  Wicks are often infused with a variety of [[chemical]]s to modify their burning characteristics.  For example, it is usually desirable that the wick not glow after the flame is extinguished.  Typical agents are [[ammonium nitrate]] and [[ammonium sulfate]].<ref name= Ullmann/>

==Characteristics==

===Light===
[[File:candles.jpg|thumb|A room lit by the glow of many candles]]

Based on measurements of a taper-type, paraffin wax candle, a modern candle typically burns at a steady rate of about 0.1&nbsp;g/min, releasing heat at roughly 80&nbsp;W.<ref name=Hamins>{{cite journal |last1=Hamins |first1=Anthony |last2=Bundy |first2=Matthew |last3=Dillon |first3=Scott E. |date=November 2005 |title=Characterization of Candle Flames |journal=Journal of Fire Protection Engineering |volume=15 |issue= 4|pages= |page=277 |publisher= |doi=10.1177/1042391505053163 |url=http://fire.nist.gov/bfrlpubs/fire05/PDF/f05141.pdf  |format=PDF}}</ref> The light produced is about 13 [[lumen (unit)|lumens]], for a [[luminous efficacy]] of about 0.16 lumens per watt (luminous efficacy of a source) – almost a hundred times lower than an [[incandescent light bulb]].

The [[luminous intensity]] of a typical candle is approximately one [[candela]]. The [[SI]] unit, candela, was in fact based on an older unit called the ''[[candlepower]]'', which represented the luminous intensity emitted by a candle made to particular specifications (a "standard candle"). The modern unit is defined in a more precise and repeatable way, but was chosen such that a candle's luminous intensity is still about one candela.

===Temperature===
{{see also|Combustion}}

The hottest part of a candle flame is just above the very dull blue part to one side of the flame, at the base. At this point, the flame is about {{convert|1400|C|F}}. However note that this part of the flame is very small and releases little heat energy.  The blue color is due to [[chemiluminescence]], while the visible yellow color is due to radiative emission from hot [[soot]] particles.  The soot is formed through a series of complex chemical reactions, leading from the fuel molecule through molecular growth, until multi-carbon ring compounds are formed.  The thermal structure of a flame is complex, hundreds of degrees over very short distances leading to extremely steep temperature gradients. On average, the flame temperature is about {{convert|1000|C|F}}.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pbslearningmedia.org/resource/phy03.sci.phys.matter.onfire/on-fire/|title=On Fire – Background Essay|website=PBS LearningMedia|publisher=[[PBS]] and [[WGBH Educational Foundation]]|accessdate=April 8, 2015}}</ref> The [[color temperature]] is approximately 1000 K.

===Candle flame===
[[File:Anatomy of a candle flame.svg|thumb|Five zones of a standard domestic candle flame]]

A candle flame is formed because wax vaporizes on burning. A candle flame is widely recognized as having between three and five regions or "zones":
* Zone I - this is the non-luminous, lowest, and coolest part of the candle flame.  It is located around the base of the wick where there is insufficient oxygen for fuel to burn.  Temperatures are around {{convert|600|C|F}}.
* Zone II - this is the ''blue zone'' which surrounds the base of the flame.  Here the supply of oxygen is plentiful, and the fuel burns clean and blue.  It is heat from this zone which causes the wax to melt. Temperatures are around {{convert|800|C|F}}
* Zone III - the ''dark zone'' is a region directly above the wick containing unburnt wax.  Pyrolysis takes place here.  Temperature is around {{convert|1000|C|F}}
*Zone IV - the ''middle'' or ''luminous zone'' is yellow/ white and is located above the dark zone.  It is the brightest zone, but not the hottest.  It is an oxygen-depleted zone with insufficient oxygen to burn all of the wax vapor rising from below it resulting in only partial combustion. The zone also contains unburnt carbon vapor. Temperature is around {{convert|1200|C|F}}.
* Zone V - The non-luminous  ''outer zone'' or ''veil'' surrounds Zone IV.  Here the flame is at its hottest, at around {{convert|1400|C|F}}, and complete combustion occurs. It is light blue in color though most of it is invisible.<ref>{{cite web|work=Ohio State University|title=FTIR STUDY OF COMBUSTION SPECIES IN SEVERAL REGIONS OF A CANDLE FLAME|url=https://kb.osu.edu/handle/1811/55436|accessdate=26 January 2019|author=Allen R. White|date=2013}}</ref><ref>[[National Council of Educational Research and Training]]. "Science: Textbook for Class VIII". Publication Department, 2010, p.72.</ref>

The main determinant of the height of a candle flame is the diameter of the wick. This is evidenced in [[tealight]]s where the wick is very thin and the flame is very small. Candles whose main purpose is illumination use a much thicker wick.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Sunderland |first1=P.B. |last2=Quintiere |first2=J.G. |last3=Tabaka |first3=G.A. |last4=Lian |first4=D. |last5=Chiu |first5=C.-W. |title=Analysis and measurement of candle flame shapes |url=http://terpconnect.umd.edu/~pbs/2011-Sunderland-et-al-PCI.pdf |date=6 October 2010 |journal=Proceedings of the Combustion Institute |volume=33 |pp=2489–2496 |accessdate=2015-02-10}}</ref>

===History of study===
One of [[Michael Faraday]]'s significant works was ''[[The Chemical History of a Candle]]'', where he gives an in-depth analysis of the evolutionary development, workings and science of candles.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/mod/1860Faraday-candle.asp |title=Internet History Sourcebooks |publisher=Fordham.edu |accessdate=2012-12-25}}</ref>

==Hazards==
According to the U.S. National Fire Protection Association, candles are a leading source of residential fires in the United States with almost 10% of civilian injuries and 6% of fatalities from fire attributed to candles.<ref>John Hall, NFPA 2009,  {{cite web|url=http://www.nfpa.org/assets/files/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-01-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110727124011/http://www.nfpa.org/assets/files//PDF/Research/Fire_overview_2009.pdf |archivedate=2011-07-27 |df= }}.</ref>
A candle flame that is longer than its laminar smoke point will emit [[soot]].<ref>K.M. Allan, J.R. Kaminski, J.C. Bertrand, J. Head, [[Peter B. Sunderland]], Laminar Smoke Points of Wax Candles, Combustion Science and Technology 181 (2009) 800–811.</ref> Proper wick trimming will reduce soot emissions from most candles.

The liquid wax is hot and can cause skin burns, but the amount and temperature are generally rather limited and the burns are seldom serious. The best way to avoid getting burned from splashed wax is to use a [[candle snuffer]] instead of blowing on the flame. A candle snuffer is usually a small metal cup on the end of a long handle. Placing the snuffer over the flame cuts off the oxygen supply. Snuffers were common in the home when candles were the main source of lighting before electric lights were available.  Ornate snuffers, often combined with a taper for lighting, are still found in those churches which regularly use large candles.

Glass candle-holders are sometimes cracked by thermal shock from the candle flame, particularly when the candle burns down to the end. When burning candles in glass holders or jars, users should avoid lighting candles with chipped or cracked containers, and stop use once 1/2&nbsp;inch or less of wax remains.

A former worry regarding the safety of candles was that a [[lead]] core was used in the wicks to keep them upright in container candles. Without a stiff core, the wicks of a container candle could sag and drown in the deep wax pool. Concerns rose that the lead in these wicks would vaporize during the burning process, releasing lead vapors — a known health and developmental hazard. Lead core wicks have not been common since the 1970s. Today, most metal-cored wicks use [[zinc]] or a zinc [[alloy]], which has become the industry standard. Wicks made from specially treated paper and cotton are also available.

==Regulation==
International markets have developed a range of standards and [[regulation]]s to ensure compliance, while maintaining and improving [[safety]], including:
* Europe: GPSD, EN 15493, EN 15494, EN 15426, EN 14059, [[Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals|REACH]], RAL-GZ 041 Candles (Germany), French Decree 91-1175
* United States: ASTM F2058, ASTM F2179, ASTM F2417, ASTM F2601, ASTM F2326, [[California Proposition 65 (1986)|California Proposition 65]], CONEG
* China: QB/T 2119 Basic Candle, QB/T 2902 Art Candle, QB/T 2903 Jar Candle, GB/T 22256 Jelly Candle

==Accessories==
[[File:Wick-Trimmer.jpg|thumb|wick-trimmer]]
===Candle holders===
Decorative candleholders, especially those shaped as a pedestal, are called [[candlestick]]s; if multiple candle tapers are held, the term ''candelabrum'' is also used. The root form of ''[[chandelier]]'' is from the word for candle, but now usually refers to an electric fixture. The word ''chandelier'' is sometimes now used to describe a hanging fixture designed to hold multiple tapers.

Many candle holders use a friction-tight socket to keep the candle upright. In this case, a candle that is slightly too wide will not fit in the holder, and a candle that is slightly too narrow will wobble. Candles that are too big can be trimmed to fit with a knife; candles that are too small can be fitted with aluminium foil. Traditionally, the candle and candle holders were made in the same place, so they were appropriately sized, but [[common market|international trade]] has combined the modern candle with existing holders, which makes the ill-fitting candle more common. This friction tight socket is only needed for the federals and the tapers. For [[tea light]] candles, there are a variety of candle holders, including small glass holders and elaborate multi-candle stands. The same is true for [[votive candle|votives]]. Wall sconces are available for tea light and votive candles. For pillar-type candles, the assortment of candle holders is broad. A fireproof plate, such as a glass plate or small mirror, is a candle holder for a pillar-style candle. A pedestal of any kind, with the appropriate-sized fireproof top, is another option. A large glass bowl with a large flat bottom and tall mostly vertical curved sides is called a hurricane. The pillar-style candle is placed at the bottom center of the hurricane. A hurricane on a pedestal is sometimes sold as a unit.

A [[bobèche]] is a drip-catching ring, which may also be affixed to a candle holder, or used independently of one. Bobèches can range from ornate metal or glass, to simple plastic, cardboard, or wax paper. Use of paper or plastic bobèches is common at events where candles are distributed to a crowd or audience, such as Christmas carolers or people at other concerts/festivals.

===Candle followers===
These are glass or metal tubes with an internal stricture partway along, which sit around the top of a lit candle. As the candle burns, the wax melts and the follower holds the melted wax in, whilst the stricture rests on the topmost solid portion of wax. Candle followers are often deliberately heavy or weighted to ensure they move down as the candle burns lower, maintaining a seal and preventing wax escape. The purpose of a candle follower is threefold:
* To contain the melted wax, making the candle more efficient, avoiding mess, and producing a more even burn.
* As a decoration, either due to the ornate nature of the device, or (in the case of a glass follower) through light dispersion or colouration.
* If necessary, to shield the flame from wind.

Candle followers are often found in churches on [[altar candle]]s.

===Candle snuffers===
{{main|Candle snuffer}}
Candle snuffers are instruments used to extinguish burning candles by smothering the flame with a small metal cup that is suspended from a long handle, and thus depriving it of oxygen. An older meaning refers to a scissor-like tool used to trim the wick of a candle. With skill, this could be done without extinguishing the flame. The instrument now known as a candle snuffer was formerly called an "extinguisher" or "douter".
