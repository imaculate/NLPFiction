===Etymology===
Nantucket probably takes its name from a [[Wampanoag]] word, transliterated variously as ''natocke'', ''nantaticu'', ''nantican'', ''nautica'' or ''natockete'', which is part of Wampanoag lore about the creation of [[Martha's Vineyard]] and Nantucket.<ref>

=== European Colonization ===
The earliest English settlement in the region began on the neighboring island of [[Martha's Vineyard]].  Nantucket Island's original [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] inhabitants, the [[Wampanoag people]], lived undisturbed until 1641 when the island was deeded by the English (the authorities in control of all land from the coast of Maine to New York) to [[Thomas Mayhew]] and his son, merchants from [[Watertown, Massachusetts]], and Martha's Vineyard. Nantucket was part of [[Dukes County, New York|Dukes County]], [[New York (state)|New York]], until 1691, when it was transferred to the newly formed [[Province of Massachusetts Bay]] and split off to form Nantucket County.  As Europeans began to settle Cape Cod, the island became a place of refuge for Native Americans in the region, as Nantucket was not yet settled by Europeans. The growing population welcomed seasonal groups of other Native Americans who traveled to the island to fish and later harvest whales that washed up on shore.<ref>

===Nantucket founders===
In October 1641, William, Earl of Stirling, deeded the island to Thomas Mayhew of Watertown, [[Massachusetts Bay]]. In 1659 Mayhew sold an interest in the island to nine other purchasers, reserving 1/10th of an interest for himself, "for the sum of thirty pounds&nbsp;... and also two beaver hats, one for myself, and one for my wife."<ref>{{cite book|last1=Worth|first1=Henry|title=Nantucket Lands and Landowners|date=1901|publisher=Nantucket Historical Association|pages=53–82|edition=Volume 2, Issue 1}}</ref>

Each of the ten original owners was allowed to invite one partner. There is some confusion about the identity of the first twenty owners, partly because William Pile did not choose a partner, and sold his interest to Richard Swain, which was subsequently divided between John Bishop and the children of George Bunker.

Anxious to add to their number and to induce tradesmen to come to the island, the total number of shares were increased to twenty-seven. The original purchasers needed the assistance of tradesmen who were skilled in the arts of weaving, milling, building and other pursuits and selected men who were given half a share provided that they lived on Nantucket and carried on their trade for at least three years.

By 1667, twenty-seven shares had been divided among 31 owners.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Anderson|first1=Florence|title=A Grandfather for Benjamin Franklin: The True Story of a Nantucket Pioneer and His Mates|date=1940|publisher=Meador|page=183}}</ref>

=== British settlement ===
Nantucket's settlement by the English did not begin in earnest until 1659, when Thomas Mayhew sold his interest to a group of investors, led by [[Tristram Coffin (Nantucket)|Tristram Coffin]]. The "nine original purchasers" were Tristram Coffin, Peter Coffin, [[Thomas Macy]], Christopher Hussey, Richard Swain, Thomas Barnard, [[Stephen Greenleaf]], John Swain and William Pike. These men are considered the founding fathers of Nantucket, and many islanders are related to these families. Seamen and tradesmen began to populate Nantucket, such as Richard Gardner (arrived 1667) and Capt. John Gardner (arrived 1672), sons of [[Thomas Gardner (planter)|Thomas Gardner]].<ref>Gardner, Frank A MD (1907). ''Thomas Gardner Planter and Some of his Descendants''. Salem, MA: Essex Institute.

In his 1835 history of Nantucket Island, Obed Macy wrote that in the early pre-1672 colony, a whale of the kind called "scragg" entered the harbor and was pursued and killed by the settlers.<ref>{{cite book |author= Macy, Obed |title=The History of Nantucket:being a compendious account of the first settlement of the island by the English:together with the rise and progress of the whale fishery, and other historical facts relative to said island and its inhabitants:in two parts |year=1835 |publisher= Hilliard, Gray & Co. |location= Boston |isbn=1-4374-0223-2 }}</ref> This event started the Nantucket whaling industry.

[[Herman Melville]] commented on Nantucket's whaling dominance in ''[[Moby-Dick]]'', Chapter 14: "Two thirds of this terraqueous globe are the Nantucketer's. For the sea is his; he owns it, as Emperors own empires". The ''Moby-Dick'' characters [[Captain Ahab|Ahab]] and [[List of Moby-Dick characters#Mates|Starbuck]] are both from Nantucket.

By 1850, whaling was in decline, as Nantucket's whaling industry had been surpassed by that of [[New Bedford]]. The island suffered great economic hardships, worsened by the "Great Fire" of July 13, 1846, that, fueled by whale oil and lumber, devastated the main town, burning some {{convert|40|acres|0|abbr=off}}.<ref>{{cite book | last1 = Kelley | first1 = Shawnie | title = It Happened on Cape Cod | publisher = Globe Pequot | year = 2006 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=EuSeEVcASI4C | accessdate = 2011-11-22 | isbn = 978-0-7627-3824-3}}</ref> The fire left hundreds homeless and poverty-stricken, and many people left the island. Another contributor to the decline was the silting up of the harbor, which prevented large whaling ships from entering and leaving the port, unlike New Bedford, which still owned a deep water port. In addition, the development of railroads made mainland whaling ports, such as New Bedford, more attractive because of the ease of [[transshipment]] of whale oil onto trains, an advantage unavailable to an island.  The [[American Civil War]] dealt the death blow to the island's whaling industry, as virtually all of the remaining whaling vessels were destroyed by [[Confederate States of America|Confederate]] [[commerce raiders]].{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}

=== Later history ===
As a result of this depopulation, the island was left under-developed and isolated until the mid-20th century. The isolation kept many of the pre-Civil War buildings intact and, by the 1950s, enterprising developers began buying up large sections of the island and restoring them to create an upmarket destination for wealthy people in the Northeastern United States.

In the 1960s, Nantucket and Martha's Vineyard considered seceding from the Commonwealth of Massachusetts which they tried in 1977, unsuccessfully. The secession vote was sparked by a proposed change to the [[Massachusetts Constitution]] that reduced the islands' representation in the [[Massachusetts General Court]].<ref>[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,914917-2,00.html People Section] ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine, April 18, 1977.]</ref>

Nantucket was formed by the outermost reach of the [[Laurentide Ice Sheet]] during the recent [[Wisconsin Glaciation]], shaped by the subsequent rise in sea level. The low ridge across the northern section of the island was deposited as [[glacial moraine]] during a period of glacial standstill, a period during which [[till]] continued to arrive and was deposited as the glacier melted at a stationary front. The southern part of the island is an [[outwash plain]], sloping away from the arc of the moraine and shaped at its margins by the sorting actions and transport of [[longshore drift]]. Nantucket became an island when rising sea levels covered the connection with the mainland, about 5,000–6,000 years ago.<ref>The most recent survey of the geology of Cape Cod and the islands, accessible to the layman, is Robert N. Oldale, ''Cape Cod, Martha's Vineyard & Nantucket: The Geologic Story'', 2001.</ref>

The entire island, as well as the adjoining islands of Tuckernuck and Muskeget, comprise both the Town of Nantucket and the County of Nantucket, which are [[Consolidated city–county|consolidated]]. The main settlement, also called Nantucket, is located at the western end of Nantucket Harbor, where it opens into Nantucket Sound. Key localities on the island include [[Madaket, Massachusetts|Madaket]], [[Surfside, Massachusetts|Surfside]], [[Polpis, Massachusetts|Polpis]], Wauwinet, Miacomet, and [[Siasconset, Massachusetts|Siasconset]] (generally shortened to "'Sconset").<ref name=Oars>

==Climate==
According to the [[Köppen climate classification]] system, Nantucket features a climate that borders between a ''Dfb'' ([[humid continental climate]]) and an ''Cfb'' ([[oceanic climate]] - east half of the island based on the location of the [[weather station]]), the latter a climate type rarely found on the east coast of [[North America]] and closest to the same by the original classification.<ref name = Köppen>{{cite journal| last = Kottek | first = M.|author2=J.

Average high temperatures during the town's coldest month (January) are around {{convert|38|F|C}}, while average high temperatures during the town's warmest months (July and August) hover around {{convert|75|F|C}}. Nantucket receives on average {{convert|41|in|mm}} of precipitation annually, spread relatively evenly throughout the year. Similar to many other cities with an oceanic climate, Nantucket features a large number of cloudy or overcast days, particularly outside the summer months. The highest daily maximum temperature was {{convert|100|F|C}} on August 2, 1975, and the highest daily minimum temperature was {{convert|76|F|C}} on the same day.

==Transportation==

From 1900 to 1918, Nantucket was one of few jurisdictions in the United States that banned automobiles.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.flickr.com/photos/nantuckethistoricalassociation/3347365572/|title=Flickr|website=Flickr}}</ref>

Nantucket can be reached by sea from the mainland by [[The Woods Hole, Martha's Vineyard and Nantucket Steamship Authority|The Steamship Authority]], [[Hy-Line Cruises]], or Freedom Cruise Line, or by private boat.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nantucketchamber.org/by-sea.html|title=Business Directory Search - Nantucket Island Chamber of Commerce, MA|website=www.nantucketchamber.org}}</ref> A task force was formed in 2002 to consider limiting the number of vehicles on the island, in an effort to combat heavy traffic during the summer months.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20131114103706/http://www.capecodonline.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=%2F20020507%2FNEWS01%2F305079971 Nantucket 'gridlock' spurs plan to limit cars on island]. CapeCodOnline.com (2002-05-07). Retrieved on 2013-08-16.</ref>

Nantucket is served by [[Nantucket Memorial Airport]] ([[IATA airport code]] ACK), a three-runway airport on the south side of the island. The airport is one of the busiest in Massachusetts and often logs more take-offs and landings on a summer day than Boston's [[Logan Airport]]. This is due in part to the large number of private planes used by wealthy summer inhabitants, and in part to the 10-seat [[Cessna 402]]s used by several commercial air carriers to serve the island community.

[[Nantucket Regional Transit Authority]] operates seasonal island-wide shuttle buses to many destinations including Surfside Beach, Siasconset, and the airport.

Until 1917, Nantucket was served by the narrow-gauge [[Nantucket Railroad]].
