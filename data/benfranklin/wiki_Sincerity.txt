'''Sincerity''' is the [[virtue]] of one who communicates and acts in accordance with  their feelings, beliefs, thoughts, and desires.

== Etymology ==
The [[Oxford English Dictionary]] and most scholars state that ''sincerity'' from ''sincere'' is derived from the Latin ''sincerus'' meaning ''clean, pure, sound'' (1525–35). ''Sincerus'' may have once meant "one growth" (not mixed), from ''sin-'' (one) and ''crescere'' (to grow).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.etymonline.com/search?q=sincerity|title=sincerity - Search Online Etymology Dictionary|website=www.etymonline.com}}</ref> ''Crescere'' is cognate with "[[Ceres (Roman mythology)|Ceres]]," the goddess of grain, as in
"cereal."<ref name="Edwards">Bob Edwards. ''Origin of the word cereal.'' [[National Public Radio]] (NPR). Show: Morning Edition (11:00 AM on ET) October 21, 1999.</ref>

According to the [[American Heritage Dictionary]],<ref>[http://www.bartleby.com/61/roots/IE223.html Bartleby.com] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071017122344/http://bartleby.com/61/roots/IE223.html |date=2007-10-17 }}</ref> the Latin word ''sincerus'' is derived from the Indo-European root ''*sm̥kēros'', itself derived from the zero-grade of ''*sem'' (''one'') and the suffixed, lengthened e-grade of ''*ker'' (''grow''), generating the underlying meaning ''of one growth'', hence ''pure, clean.''

=== Controversy ===
An often repeated [[false etymology|folk etymology]] proposes that ''sincere'' is derived from the [[Latin language|Latin]] ''sine'' = ''without'', ''cera'' = ''wax''.  According to one popular explanation, dishonest sculptors in [[Rome]] or [[Greece]] would cover flaws in their work with wax to deceive the viewer; therefore, a sculpture "without wax" would mean honesty in its perfection. In its early days the word could refer to the immaterial and material. "One spoke of sincere wine...simply to mean that it had not been adulterated, or, as was once said, sophisticated."<ref>{{cite book|title=Sincerity and Authenticity|last=Trilling|first=Lionel|publisher=Harvard University Press|year=1972|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts|pages=12–13}}</ref> Another explanation is that this etymology "is derived from a Greeks-bearing-gifts story of deceit and betrayal. For the feat of victory, the Romans demanded the handing over of obligatory tributes. Following bad advice, the Greeks resorted to some faux-marble statues made of wax, which they offered as tribute. These promptly melted in the warm Greek sun."<ref>Ruth Wajnryb. "[http://www.smh.com.au/news/words/if-you-hear-buzzing-get-the-wax-out-of-your-ears/2006/11/16/1163266707150.html If you hear buzzing, get the wax out of your ears]"; Words. ''[[Sydney Morning Herald]]'' (Australia). Spectrum; Books; Pg. 32. November 18, 2006.</ref>
The [[Oxford English Dictionary]] states, however, that "there is no probability in the old explanation from sine cera 'without wax'".

The popularity of the ''without wax'' etymology is reflected in its use as a minor subplot in [[Dan Brown]]'s 1998 thriller novel ''[[Digital Fortress]]'', though Brown attributes it to the [[Spanish language]], not Latin. Reference to the same etymology, this time attributed to Latin, later appears in his 2009 novel, ''[[The Lost Symbol]]''.

==In Western societies==
First discussed by [[Aristotle]] in his ''[[Nicomachean Ethics#Book 4: Other virtues|Nicomachean Ethics]]'', it resurfaced to become an ideal ([[virtue]]) in [[Europe]] and [[North America]] in the 17th century; and it gained considerable momentum during the [[Romantic movement]], when sincerity was first celebrated as an [[artistic]] and social ideal.  Indeed, in middle to late nineteenth century America, sincerity was an idea reflected in mannerisms, hairstyles, women's dress, and the literature of the time.

More recently sincerity has been under assault by several modern developments such as [[psychoanalysis]] and [[postmodern]] developments such as [[deconstruction]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2007}} Some scholars view sincerity as a [[wikt:construct|construct]] rather than a moral virtue—although any virtue can be construed as a 'mere construct' rather than an actual phenomenon{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}. Because knowledge of self is necessarily subjective, the philosopher Harry Frankfurt has argued that "sincerity itself is bullshit"<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/56632137|title=On bullshit|last=Frankfurt|first=Harry G.,|date=2005|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=9780691122946|location=Princeton, NJ|oclc=56632137}}</ref>.

Literary critic [[Lionel Trilling]] dealt with the subject of sincerity, its roots, its evolution, its moral quotient, and its relationship to [[authenticity (philosophy)|authenticity]] in a series of lectures published under the title ''[[Sincerity and Authenticity]]''.

===Aristotle's views===
According to Aristotle "[[Honesty|truthfulness]] or sincerity is a desirable mean state between the deficiency of [[irony]] or [[self-deprecation]] and the excess of [[boast]]fulness."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.sparknotes.com/philosophy/ethics/section4/|title=SparkNotes: Nicomachean Ethics: Book IV|website=www.sparknotes.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Bwq6k-MunOAC&pg=PA103&lpg=PA103&dq=nicomachean+ethics+and+sincerity&source=web&ots=60d52vT2aj&sig=EppbqkTveUFX6TKx2l0eHMhZwgI&hl=en|title=The Nicomachean Ethics|first=|last=Aristotle|date=12 January 1996|publisher=Wordsworth Editions|via=Google Books}}</ref>

==In Confucian societies==
''See'' '''''[[w:The Analects|The Analects]]'''''

Beyond the [[Western culture]], sincerity is notably developed as a virtue in [[Confucian]] societies ([[China]], [[Korea]], and [[Japan]]). The concept of ''chéng'' (誠、诚) — as expounded in two of the Confucian classics, the ''Da Xue'' and the ''Zhong Yong'' — is generally translated as ''sincerity''. As in the West, the term implies a congruence of avowal and inner feeling, but inner feeling is in turn ideally responsive to ritual propriety and [[social hierarchy]]. Specifically, Confucian's ''Analects'' contains the following statement in Chapter I: (主忠信。毋友不如己者。過，則勿憚改。) "Hold faithfulness and sincerity as first principles. Then no friends would not be like yourself (all friends would be as loyal as yourself). If you make a mistake, do not be afraid to correct it."

Thus, even today, a powerful leader will praise leaders of other realms as "sincere" to the extent that they ''know their place'' in the sense of fulfilling a role in the drama of life. In Japanese the character for ''cheng'' may be pronounced ''makoto'', and carries still more strongly the sense of loyal avowal and belief.
