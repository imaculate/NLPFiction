==Etymology==
{{See also|Names of European cities in different languages: C–D#D|l1=Other names of Dublin}}

The name ''Dublin'' comes from the Irish word ''Dubhlinn'', early [[Classical Gaelic|Classical Irish]] {{lang|ghc|Dubhlind}}/{{lang|ghc|Duibhlind}}, from {{lang|ghc|dubh}} ({{IPA-all|d̪uβ|}}, {{IPA-all|d̪uw|}}, {{IPA-all|d̪uː|}}) meaning "black, dark", and {{lang|ghc|lind}} ({{IPA-all|lʲiɲ(d̪ʲ)|}}) "pool", referring to a dark tidal pool. This tidal pool was located where the [[River Poddle]] entered the [[River Liffey|Liffey]], on the site of the castle gardens at the rear of [[Dublin Castle]]. In Modern Irish the name is ''Duibhlinn'', and Irish rhymes from County Dublin show that in Dublin [[Irish language#Leinster|Leinster Irish]] it was pronounced ''Duílinn'' {{IPA-ga|ˈd̪ˠiːlʲiɲ|}}. The original pronunciation is preserved in the names for the city in other languages such as [[Old English]] {{lang|ang|Di'''f'''elin}}, [[Old Norse]] {{lang|non|Dy'''f'''lin}}, modern [[Icelandic language|Icelandic]] {{lang|is|Dy'''f'''linn}} and modern [[Manx language|Manx]] {{lang|gv|Di'''v'''lyn}} as well as [[Welsh language|Welsh]] {{lang|cy|Du'''lyn'''}}. Other localities in Ireland also bear the name ''Duibhlinn'', variously anglicized as Devlin,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.logainm.ie/en/14364 |title=Placenames Database of Ireland: Duibhlinn/Devlin |accessdate=13 September 2013}}</ref> Divlin<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.logainm.ie/en/13534 |title=Placenames Database of Ireland: Béal Duibhlinne/Ballydivlin |accessdate=13 September 2013}}</ref> and Difflin.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.logainm.ie/en/16486 |title=Placenames Database of Ireland: Duibhlinn/Difflin |accessdate=13 September 2013}}</ref> Historically, scribes using the [[Insular script|Gaelic script]] wrote ''bh'' with a dot over the ''b'', rendering Duḃlinn or Duiḃlinn. Those without knowledge of Irish omitted the dot, spelling the name as ''Dublin''. Variations on the name are also found in traditionally Gaelic-speaking areas of [[Scotland]] ([[Gàidhealtachd]], cognate with Irish [[Gaeltacht]]a), such as ''An Linne Dhubh'' ("the black pool"), which is part of [[Loch Linnhe]].

It is now thought that the Viking settlement was preceded by a Christian ecclesiastical settlement known as ''Duibhlinn'', from which ''Dyflin'' took its name.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Medieval Dublin, the making of a metropolis|last=Clarke|first=Howard|publisher=Irish Academic Press|year=1995|isbn=978-0716524595|location=|page=44}}</ref> Beginning in the 9th and 10th century, there were two settlements where the modern city stands. The Viking settlement of about 841, ''Dyflin'', and a Gaelic settlement, Áth Cliath ("ford of hurdles")<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Palgrave Handbook of Literature and the City|last=Tambling|first=Jeremy|publisher=Palgrave McMillan|year=2017|isbn=978-1137549105|location=|page=98}}</ref> further up river, at the present day [[Father Mathew Bridge]] (also known as Dublin Bridge), at the bottom of Church Street. ''{{lang|ga|Baile Átha Cliath}}'', meaning "town of the hurdled [[Ford (crossing)|ford]]", is the common name for the city in modern Irish. ''{{lang|ga|Áth Cliath}}'' is a place name referring to a fording point of the River Liffey near Father Mathew Bridge. ''{{lang|ga|Baile Átha Cliath}}'' was an early Christian monastery, believed to have been in the area of Aungier Street, currently occupied by [[Whitefriar Street Carmelite Church]]. There are other towns of the same name, such as ''Àth Cliath'' in [[East Ayrshire]], Scotland, which is Anglicised as [[Horlford]].

==History==
{{Main|History of Dublin|Timeline of Dublin}}

The area of [[Dublin Bay]] has been inhabited by humans since prehistoric times, but the writings of [[Ptolemy]] (the Greco-Roman astronomer and [[cartographer]]) in about AD 140 provide possibly the earliest reference to a settlement there. He called it ''[[Eblana|Eblana polis]]'' ({{lang-grc-gre|Ἔβλανα πόλις}}).<ref name=Holder>{{cite book |last=Holder |first=Alfred |date=1896 |title=Alt-celtischer sprachschatz |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QWg9AAAAYAAJ&pg=PA1393 |language=German |location=Leipzig |publisher=B. G. Teubner |at=col.1393 |accessdate=7 November 2014 }}</ref>

Dublin celebrated its 'official' millennium in 1988, meaning the Irish government recognised 988 as the year in which the city was settled and that this first settlement would later become the city of Dublin.
[[File:Dublin - Father Mathew Bridge - 110508 182542.jpg|thumb|[[Father Mathew Bridge]], also known as Dublin Bridge]]

It is now thought<ref>Clarke, Howard (1995). Medieval Dublin, the making of a metropolis. Irish Academic Press. p. 44. {{ISBN|978-0716524595}}</ref> the Viking settlement of about 841 was preceded by a Christian ecclesiastical settlement known as ''Duibhlinn'', from which ''Dyflin'' took its name. Beginning in the 9th and 10th century, there were two settlements which later became the modern Dublin. The subsequent [[Scandinavia]]n settlement centred on the [[River Poddle]], a tributary of the Liffey in an area now known as [[Wood Quay]]. The Dubhlinn was a pool on the lowest stretch of the Poddle, used to moor ships. This pool was finally fully infilled during the early 18th century, as the city grew. The Dubhlinn lay where the Castle Garden is now located, opposite the [[Chester Beatty Library]] within [[Dublin Castle]]. ''[[Táin Bó Cuailgne]]'' ("The Cattle Raid of Cooley") refers to ''Dublind rissa ratter Áth Cliath'', meaning "Dublin, which is called Ath Cliath".

===Middle Ages===
Dublin was established as a [[Viking]] settlement in the 10th century and, despite a number of attacks by the native Irish, it remained largely under Viking control until the [[Norman invasion of Ireland]] was launched from Wales in 1169.<ref name="Davies">{{cite book | last = Davies | first = Norman | authorlink = Norman Davies | title = The Isles: a history | publisher=Macmillan | year = 1999 | location = London | page = 1222 | isbn = 978-0-333-76370-4}}</ref> It was upon the death of [[Muirchertach Mac Lochlainn]] in early 1166 that [[Ruaidrí Ua Conchobair]], [[King of Connacht]], proceeded to Dublin and was inaugurated ''King of Ireland'' without opposition. Arguably, he was the primitive undebated full king of Ireland and also the only Gaelic one.{{citation needed|date=December 2018}}

According to some historians, part of the city's early economic growth is attributed to a trade in slaves.<ref name="dickson10">{{Cite book|title= Dublin The Making of a Capital City|last=Dickson|first=David|publisher=Profile Books Ltd.|year=2014|isbn=978-0-674-74444-8|location=|page=10}}</ref> [[Slavery in Ireland]] and Dublin reached its pinnacle in the 9th and 10th centuries.<ref>{{Cite book|title= The Slave Trade of Dublin, Ninth To Twelfth Centuries|last=Holm|first=Poul|publisher=PERITIA: Journal of the Medieval Journal of Ireland|year=1989|location=|pages=x}}</ref> Prisoners from slave raids and kidnappings, which captured men, women and children, brought revenue to the Celtic Irish Sea raiders, as well as to the Vikings who had initiated the practice.<ref>{{Cite book|title= The Slave Trade of Dublin, Ninth To Twelfth Centuries|last=Holm|first=Poul|publisher=PERITIA: Journal of the Medieval Journal of Ireland|year=1989|location=|page=335|quote = ''the very idea of the taking of prisoners of war spread to the Irish [from the Vikings] in the tenth century''}}</ref> The victims came from [[Wales]], [[England]], [[Normandy]] and beyond.<ref name="dickson10"/>

The King of Leinster, [[Diarmait Mac Murchada]], after his exile by Ruaidhrí, enlisted the help of [[Richard de Clare, 2nd Earl of Pembroke|Strongbow]], the Earl of Pembroke, to conquer Dublin. Following Mac Murrough's death, Strongbow declared himself King of Leinster after gaining control of the city. In response to Strongbow's successful invasion, King [[Henry II of England]] affirmed his ultimate sovereignty by mounting a larger invasion in 1171 and pronounced himself Lord of Ireland.<ref name="Dublin.info">{{cite web|url=http://www.dublin.info/history|title=A Brief History of Dublin, Ireland|publisher=Dublin.info|accessdate=19 August 2011}}</ref> Around this time, the ''county of the City of Dublin'' was established along with certain liberties adjacent to the city proper. This continued down to 1840 when the [[Barony (Ireland)|barony]] of Dublin City was separated from the [[Dublin (barony)|barony of Dublin]]. Since 2001, both baronies have been redesignated as the ''City of Dublin''.

[[File:Dublin castle.JPG|thumb|[[Dublin Castle]], with it's 13th century tower, was the fortified seat of [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|British rule]] in Ireland until 1922]]
[[Dublin Castle]], which became the centre of Norman power in Ireland, was founded in 1204 as a major defensive work on the orders of King [[John of England]].<ref>{{cite DNB|wstitle=Fitzhenry, Meiler}}</ref> Following the appointment of the first [[Lord Mayor of Dublin]] in 1229, the city expanded and had a population of 8,000 by the end of the 13th century. Dublin prospered as a trade centre, despite an attempt by King [[Robert I of Scotland]] to capture the city in 1317.<ref name="Dublin.info"/> It remained a relatively small walled medieval town during the 14th century and was under constant threat from the surrounding native clans. In 1348, the [[Black Death]], a lethal plague which had ravaged Europe, took hold in Dublin and killed thousands over the following decade.<ref>"''[https://books.google.com/books?id=R688at3KskQC&pg=PA49#v=onepage The Story of Ireland]''".

Dublin was incorporated into the [[English Crown]] as [[the Pale]], which was a narrow strip of English settlement along the eastern seaboard. The [[Tudor conquest of Ireland]] in the 16th century spelt a new era for Dublin, with the city enjoying a renewed prominence as the centre of administrative rule in Ireland. Determined to make Dublin a Protestant city, Queen [[Elizabeth I of England]] established [[Trinity College, Dublin|Trinity College]] in 1592 as a solely Protestant university and ordered that the Catholic [[St. Patrick's Cathedral, Dublin|St. Patrick's]] and [[Christ Church Cathedral, Dublin|Christ Church]] cathedrals be converted to Protestant.<ref name="visitingdublin">{{cite web|url=http://visitingdublin.com/downloads/HistoryOfDublin.pdf|title=A Brief History of Dublin|publisher=visitingdublin|accessdate=19 August 2011}}</ref>

The city had a population of 21,000 in 1640 before a plague in 1649–51 wiped out almost half of the city's inhabitants. However, the city prospered again soon after as a result of the wool and linen trade with [[England]], reaching a population of over 50,000 in 1700.<ref>"''[https://books.google.com/books?id=gI8MYY6ASdcC&pg=PA34#v=onepage Dublin: a cultural history]''".

===Early modern===
[[File:HENRIETTA STREET - DUBLIN (402556531).jpg|thumb|[[Henrietta Street, Dublin|Henrietta Street]] developed in the 1720s is the earliest [[Georgian Dublin|Georgian street]] in Dublin]]

As the city continued to prosper during the 18th century, [[Georgian Dublin]] became, for a short period, the second largest city of the [[British Empire]] and the fifth largest city in Europe, with the population exceeding 130,000. The vast majority of Dublin's most notable architecture dates from this period - the [[Four Courts]], [[the Custom House]], [[Temple Bar, Dublin|Temple Bar]] and [[Grafton Street]] are some of the few remaining areas that were not affected by the wave of Georgian reconstruction and maintained their medieval character.<ref name="visitingdublin"/>

Dublin grew even more dramatically during the 18th century, with the construction of many new districts and buildings, such as [[Merrion Square]], [[Irish Houses of Parliament|Parliament House]] and the [[City Hall, Dublin|Royal Exchange]].<ref name="visitingdublin"/> The [[Wide Streets Commission]] was established in 1757 at the request of [[Dublin Corporation]] to govern architectural standards on the layout of streets, bridges and buildings. In 1759, the [[Guinness brewery]] was founded; and would eventually grow to become the largest brewery in the world and the largest employer in Dublin.<ref>{{cite book|url = https://books.google.com/?id=b-tFDwAAQBAJ&pg=PT12&dq=guinness+%22largest+employer%22#v=onepage&q=guinness%20%22largest%20employer%22 | publisher =  Collins Press | title = Stones of Dublin | author = Lisa Marie Griffith | date = 2014 | page = | quote = ''[Guinness] was Dublin's largest brewery in 1810, Ireland's largest in 1833, and the largest in the world by 1914.

[[File:General Post Office Dublin 20060803.jpg|thumb|[[General Post Office (Dublin)|The GPO]] on [[O'Connell Street]] was at the centre of the 1916 [[Easter Rising]]]]
Dublin suffered a period of political and economic decline during the 19th century following the [[Acts of Union 1800]], under which the seat of government was transferred to the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Westminster Parliament]] in [[London]]. The city played no major role in the [[Industrial Revolution]], but remained the centre of administration and a transport hub for most of the island. Ireland had no significant sources of coal, the fuel of the time, and Dublin was not a centre of ship manufacturing, the other main driver of industrial development in Britain and Ireland.<ref name="Davies"/> [[Belfast]] developed faster than Dublin during this period on a mixture of international trade, factory-based linen cloth production and shipbuilding.<ref name="Lyons">{{cite book | last = Lyons | first = F.S.L. | authorlink = F.S.L.

[[File:Life goes on... (6937669789).jpg|thumb|Damage in Dublin city centre following the 1916 [[Easter Rising]] with the ruins of the GPO to the left]]
The [[Easter Rising]] of 1916, the [[Irish War of Independence]], and the subsequent [[Irish Civil War]] resulted in a significant amount of physical destruction in central Dublin. The [[Government of the Irish Free State]] rebuilt the city centre and located the new parliament, the [[Oireachtas]], in [[Leinster House]]. Since the beginning of [[Normans|Norman]] rule in the 12th century, the city has functioned as the capital in varying geopolitical entities: [[Lordship of Ireland]] (1171–1541), [[Kingdom of Ireland]] (1541–1800), as part of the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland]] (1801–1922), and the [[Irish Republic]] (1919–1922). Following the [[partition of Ireland]] in 1922, it became the capital of the [[Irish Free State]] (1922–1937) and now is the capital of Ireland. One of the memorials to commemorate that time is the [[Garden of Remembrance (Dublin)|Garden of Remembrance]].

Dublin was also a victim of the [[Northern Ireland|Northern Irish]] [[The Troubles|Troubles]], although during this 30 year conflict, violence mainly occurred within Northern Ireland. However, the [[Provisional IRA]] drew some support from within the Republic, including from Dublin. A Loyalist paramilitary group, the [[Ulster Volunteer Force]], bombed the city during this time - notably in an atrocity known as the [[Dublin and Monaghan bombings]] in which 34 people died, mainly in central Dublin.

Since 1997, the landscape of Dublin has changed. The city was at the forefront of Ireland's economic expansion during the [[Celtic Tiger]] period, with private sector and state development of housing, transport and business. Following an economic decline during the Great Recession, Dublin has rebounded and {{as of|2017|lc=y}} has close to full employment,<ref name=":0">{{Cite news|url=http://issuu.com/256media/docs/dublineconomicmonitor_oct2017?e=16581915/54602478|title=Dublin Economic Monitor - October 2017|work=issuu|access-date=14 December 2017}}</ref> but a significant problem with housing supply in both city and surrounds.<ref>{{cite web|url = https://www.irishtimes.com/news/environment/construction-of-homes-in-dublin-city-halves-1.3737361 | title = Construction of homes in Dublin city halves | author = Olivia Kelly | date = 19 December 2018 | publisher = The Irish Times | website = irishtimes.com | quote = ''The number of homes under construction in Dublin city is down almost 50 per cent on last year, with a 20 per cent drop across the region as a whole, according to a new report from the Government’s Dublin Housing Supply Task Force''}}</ref>

===Local===
[[File:Dublin City Council Civic Offices.JPG|thumb|Civic Offices of [[Dublin City Council]]]]
From 1842, the boundaries of the city were comprehended by the [[Barony (Ireland)|baronies]] of Dublin City and the [[Barony of Dublin]]. In 1930, the boundaries were extended by the Local Government (Dublin) Act.<ref>[[Irish Statute Book]]. [http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1930/en/act/pub/0027/sched1.html#sched1 Local Government (Dublin) Act]</ref> Later, in 1953, the boundaries were again extended by the Local Government Provisional Order Confirmation Act.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1953/en/act/prv/0001/print.html |title=Irish statute book, Local Government Provisional Order Confirmation Act, 1953 |publisher=Irishstatutebook.ie |date=28 March 1953 |accessdate=13 September 2013}}</ref>

[[Dublin City Council]] is a [[unicameral]] assembly of 63<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dublincity.ie/main-menu-your-council/local-elections|title=Local Elections 2014|website=Dublin City Council|accessdate=13 July 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140715001530/http://www.dublincity.ie/main-menu-your-council/local-elections|archivedate=15 July 2014|df=dmy-all}}</ref> members elected every five years from [[Local Electoral Area|Local Election Areas]]. It is presided over by the [[Lord Mayor of Dublin|Lord Mayor]], who is elected for a yearly term and resides in Dublin's [[Mansion House, Dublin|Mansion House]]. Council meetings occur at [[Dublin City Hall]], while most of its administrative activities are based in the Civic Offices on [[Wood Quay]]. The party or coalition of parties with the majority of seats assigns committee members, introduces policies, and proposes the Lord Mayor. The Council passes an annual budget for spending on areas such as housing, traffic management, refuse, drainage, and planning. The Dublin City Manager is responsible for implementing City Council decisions but also has considerable executive power.

===National===
[[File:Leinsterhouse.jpg|right|thumb|[[Leinster House]] on Kildare Street houses the [[Oireachtas]]]]
As the capital city, Dublin is the seat of the national parliament of Ireland, the [[Oireachtas]]. It is composed of the [[President of Ireland]], [[Seanad Éireann]] as the upper house, and [[Dáil Éireann]] as the lower house. The President resides in [[Áras an Uachtaráin]] in [[Phoenix Park]], while both houses of the Oireachtas meet in [[Leinster House]], a former ducal palace on [[Kildare Street]]. It has been the home of the Irish parliament since the creation of the [[Irish Free State]] in 1922. The old [[Irish Houses of Parliament]] of the [[Kingdom of Ireland]] are located in [[College Green, Dublin|College Green]].

[[Government Buildings]] house the [[Department of the Taoiseach]], the Council Chamber, the Department of Finance and the [[Attorney General of Ireland|Office of the Attorney General]]. It consists of a main building (completed 1911) with two wings (completed 1921). It was designed by Thomas Manley Dean and Sir [[Aston Webb]] as the [[Royal College of Science (Ireland)|Royal College of Science]]. The [[First Dáil]] originally met in the [[Mansion House, Dublin|Mansion House]] in 1919. The Irish Free State government took over the two wings of the building to serve as a temporary home for some ministries, while the central building became the College of Technology until 1989.<ref>Department of the Taoiseach: Guide to Government Buildings (2005)</ref> Although both it and Leinster House were intended to be temporary locations, they became the permanent homes of parliament from then on.

For elections to [[Dáil Éireann]], the city is divided into five constituencies: [[Dublin Central (Dáil constituency)|Dublin Central]] (3 seats), [[Dublin Bay North (Dáil constituency)|Dublin Bay North]] (5 seats), [[Dublin North-West (Dáil constituency)|Dublin North-West]] (3 seats), [[Dublin South-Central (Dáil constituency)|Dublin South-Central]] (4 seats) and [[Dublin Bay South (Dáil constituency)|Dublin Bay South]] (4 seats). Nineteen TD's are elected in total.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.constituency-commission.ie/cc/cc-report.html|title=Constituency Commission Report 2012|website=Constituency Commission|accessdate=22 July 2014}}</ref>

===Landscape===
[[File:Dublin SPOT 1023.jpg|thumb|Satellite image showing the [[River Liffey]] entering the [[Irish Sea]] as it divides Dublin into the [[Northside (Dublin)|Northside]] and the [[Southside (Dublin)|Southside]]]]
Dublin is situated at the mouth of the [[River Liffey]] and encompasses a land area of approximately {{convert|115|km2}} in east-central Ireland. It is bordered by a low mountain range (the Dublin Mountains and [[Wicklow Mountains]]) to the south and surrounded by flat farmland to the north and west.<ref name="Facts about Dublin"/>

====Watercourses====
{{see also|List of rivers of County Dublin}}
The River Liffey divides the city in two, between the Northside and the Southside. The Liffey bends at [[Leixlip]] from a northeasterly route to a predominantly eastward direction, and this point also marks the transition to urban development from more agricultural land usage.<ref name="erdb">{{cite web|title = Final Characterisation Report  |url= http://erbd.ie/upload/files/Characterisation%20Report.pdf  |publisher=Eastern River Basin District  |at=Sec. 7: Characterisation of the Liffey Catchment Area | format = PDF | accessdate=10 November 2014}}</ref>

Two secondary rivers further divide the city &nbsp;– the [[River Tolka]], running southeast into Dublin Bay, and the [[River Dodder]] running northeast to near the mouth of the Liffey, and these and the Liffey have multiple tributaries. A number of lesser rivers and streams also flow to the sea.

Two canals&nbsp;– the [[Grand Canal of Ireland|Grand Canal]] on the southside and the [[Royal Canal of Ireland|Royal Canal]] on the northside&nbsp;– ring the inner city on their way from the west and the [[River Shannon]].

Similar to much of the rest of northwestern Europe, Dublin experiences a [[maritime climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|''Cfb'']]) with cool summers, mild winters, and a lack of temperature extremes. The average maximum January temperature is {{convert|8.8|°C|0|abbr=on}}, while the average maximum July temperature is {{convert|20.2|°C|0|abbr=on}}. On average, the sunniest months are May and June, while the wettest month is October with {{convert|76|mm|0|abbr=on}} of rain, and the driest month is February with {{convert|46|mm|0|abbr=on}}. Rainfall is evenly distributed throughout the year.

Dublin's sheltered location on the east coast makes it the driest place in Ireland, receiving only about half the rainfall of the west coast. [[Ringsend]] in the south of the city records the lowest rainfall in the country, with an average annual precipitation of {{convert|683|mm|0|abbr=on}},<ref>{{cite web|publisher=European Climate Assessment & Dataset |title=Climatology details for station DUBLIN (RINGSEND), IRELAND and index RR: Precipitation sum |url=http://eca.knmi.nl/utils/calcdetail.php?seasonid=0&periodid=1981-2010&indexid=RR&stationid=1958 |accessdate=21 December 2012}}</ref> with the average annual precipitation in the city centre being {{convert|714|mm|0|abbr=on}}. The main precipitation in winter is rain; however snow showers do occur between November and March. Hail is more common than snow. The city experiences long summer days and short winter days. Strong Atlantic winds are most common in autumn. These winds can affect Dublin, but due to its easterly location, it is least affected compared to other parts of the country. However, in winter, easterly winds render the city colder and more prone to snow showers.

In the 20th century, smog and air-pollution were an issue in the city, precipitating a ban on bituminous fuels across Dublin.<ref name="coalbangov">{{cite web|url = https://www.dccae.gov.ie/en-ie/environment/topics/air-quality/smoky-coal-ban/Pages/default.aspx | publisher = Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment | title = Smoky coal ban | accessdate = 1 January 2018 }}</ref><ref name="coalbantimes">{{cite web|url = http://www.irishtimes.com/news/environment/how-the-coal-ban-dealt-with-dublin-s-burning-issue-1.2367021 | publisher = Irish Times | title = How the coal ban dealt with Dublin's burning issue | date= 26 September 2015 |accessdate = 22 February 2017 }}</ref> The ban was implemented in 1990 to address black smoke concentrations, that had been linked to cardiovascular and respiratory deaths in residents.

===Landmarks===
{{Further|List of public art in Dublin}}
Dublin has many landmarks and monuments dating back hundreds of years. One of the oldest is [[Dublin Castle]], which was first founded as a major defensive work on the orders of England's [[John, King of England|King John]] in 1204, shortly after the [[Norman invasion of Ireland]] in 1169, when it was commanded that a castle be built with strong walls and good ditches for the defence of the city, the administration of justice, and the protection of the King's treasure.<ref name=history>{{cite book|last= McCarthy|first= Denis |author2=Benton, David |year= 2004|title= Dublin Castle: at the heart of Irish History|location= Dublin|publisher=Irish Government Stationery Office |pages= 12–18|isbn= 978-0-7557-1975-4}}</ref> Largely complete by 1230, the castle was of typical Norman courtyard design, with a central square without a [[keep]], bounded on all sides by tall defensive walls and protected at each corner by a circular tower. Sited to the south-east of Norman Dublin, the castle formed one corner of the outer perimeter of the city, using the [[River Poddle]] as a natural means of defence.

[[File:O'Connell Street Dublin & Jim Larkin.JPG|thumb|left|upright|[[Spire of Dublin]] rises behind the statue of [[James Larkin|Jim Larkin]]]]
One of Dublin's newest monuments is the [[Spire of Dublin]], officially entitled the "Monument of Light."<ref>

}}</ref> It is a {{convert|121.2|m|ft|adj=on}} conical spire made of stainless steel, located on [[O'Connell Street]] where it meets Henry Street and North Earl Street. It replaces [[Nelson's Pillar]] and is intended to mark Dublin's place in the 21st century. The spire was designed by [[Ian Ritchie Architects]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://archiseek.com/2010/2003-the-dublin-spire-oconnell-street-dublin/ |title=The Dublin Spire |publisher=Archiseek |year=2003 |accessdate=20 October 2011}}</ref> who sought an "Elegant and dynamic simplicity bridging art and technology". The base of the monument is lit and the top is illuminated to provide a beacon in the night sky across the city.

The Old Library of [[Trinity College, Dublin]], holding the [[Book of Kells]], is one of the city's most visited sites.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.irishtimes.com/business/transport-and-tourism/guinness-storehouse-tops-list-of-most-visited-attractions-1.1476060 | publisher = Irish Times | title = Guinness Storehouse tops list of most visited attractions | date= 26 July 2013}}</ref> The Book of Kells is an illustrated manuscript created by Irish monks circa 800 AD. The [[Ha'penny Bridge]], an iron footbridge over the River Liffey, is one of the most photographed sights in Dublin and is considered to be one of Dublin's most iconic landmarks.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.traveldir.org/articles/europe/ireland/dublin/some_famous_landmarks_of_dublin.html |title=Some Famous Landmarks of Dublin&nbsp;– Dublin Hotels & Travel Guide |publisher=Traveldir.org |date=8 March 1966 |accessdate=16 September 2011}}</ref>

Other landmarks and monuments include [[Christ Church Cathedral, Dublin|Christ Church Cathedral]] and [[St Patrick's Cathedral, Dublin|St Patrick's Cathedral]], the [[Mansion House, Dublin|Mansion House]], the [[Molly Malone|Molly Malone statue]], the complex of buildings around Leinster House, including part of the [[National Museum of Ireland]] and the [[National Library of Ireland]], [[The Custom House]] and [[Áras an Uachtaráin]]. Other sights include the [[Anna Livia (monument)|Anna Livia monument]].  The [[Poolbeg Generating Station|Poolbeg Towers]] are also landmark features of Dublin, and visible from various spots around the city.

===Parks===
[[File:Dublin Stephen's Green-44 edit.jpg|thumb|Aerial view of [[St Stephen's Green]]]]
There are many green-spaces around the city, and Dublin City Council manages over {{convert|1500|ha|acre}} of parks.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dublincity.ie/main-menu-services-recreation-culture/dublin-city-parks|title=Dublin City Parks |publisher=[[Dublin City Council]] |accessdate=1 September 2015}}</ref> Public parks include the [[Phoenix Park]], [[Herbert Park]], [[St Stephen's Green]], [[Saint Anne's Park]] and [[Bull Island]]. The Phoenix Park is about {{convert|3|km|0|abbr=in}} west of the city centre, north of the [[River Liffey]]. Its {{convert|16|km|0|adj=on}} perimeter wall encloses {{convert|707|ha|acre}}, making it one of the largest walled city parks in Europe.<ref>It is larger than all of London's city parks put together, and more than twice the area of New York's Central Park. {{cite web

|publisher=[[Office of Public Works]]
|accessdate=1 January 2018
}}</ref> It includes large areas of grassland and tree-lined avenues, and since the 17th century has been home to a herd of wild [[Fallow Deer|Fallow deer]]. The residence of the [[President of Ireland]] (Áras an Uachtaráin), which was built in 1751,<ref>{{cite web|title=Outline History of Áras an Uachtaráin|url=http://www.president.ie/en/explore-visit/the-house|website=Áras an Uachtaráin|accessdate=7 January 2013}}</ref> is located in the park. The park is also home to [[Dublin Zoo]], [[Ashtown Castle]], and the official residence of the [[United States Ambassador to Ireland|United States Ambassador]]. Music concerts are also sometimes held in the park.

St Stephen's Green is adjacent to one of Dublin's main shopping streets, [[Grafton Street, Dublin|Grafton Street]], and to a shopping centre named for it, while on its surrounding streets are the offices of a number of public bodies.

[[Saint Anne's Park]] is a public park and recreational facility, shared between [[Raheny]] and [[Clontarf, Dublin|Clontarf]], both suburbs on the Northside. The park, the second largest municipal park in Dublin, is part of a former {{convert|2|km²|sqmi acre|sigfig=1|adj=on}} estate assembled by members of the [[Guinness family]], beginning with [[Benjamin Lee Guinness]] in 1835 (the largest municipal park is nearby (North) [[Bull Island]], also shared between Clontarf and Raheny), featuring a 5&nbsp;km beach.

==Economy==
{{Main|Economy of Dublin}}

[[File:The Ulster Bank Group HQ, George's Quay Plaza - geograph.org.uk - 1743476.jpg|thumb|[[Ulster Bank]] on [[George's Quay Plaza]]]] The Dublin region is the economic centre of Ireland, and was at the forefront of the country's economic expansion during the [[Celtic Tiger]] period. In 2009, Dublin was listed as the fourth richest city in the world by [[purchasing power]] and 10th richest by personal income.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.citymayors.com/economics/usb-purchasing-power.html |title=Richest cities in the world by purchasing power in 2009 |publisher=City Mayors |accessdate=17 June 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.citymayors.com/economics/richest_cities.html |title=Richest cities in the world by personal earnings in 2009 |publisher=Citymayors.com |date=22 August 2009 |accessdate=17 June 2010}}</ref> According to ''Mercer's 2011 Worldwide Cost of Living Survey'', Dublin is the 13th most expensive city in the [[European Union]] (down from 10th in 2010) and the 58th most expensive place to live in the world (down from 42nd in 2010).<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/news/dublin-falls-in-city-cost-rankings-1.879923|title=Dublin falls in city-cost rankings |work=Irish Times |date=12 July 2011 |accessdate=20 July 2011}}</ref> {{As of|2017}}, approximately 874,400 people were employed in the Greater Dublin Area. Around 60% of people who are employed in Ireland's financial, ICT, and professional sectors are located in this area.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.dublinchamber.ie/business-agenda/about-dublin|title=About Dublin. Economic Activity, Tax & Employment|last=|first=|date=|website=Dublin Chamber|access-date=2018-11-12}}</ref>

A number of Dublin's traditional industries, such as food processing, textile manufacturing, brewing, and distilling have gradually declined, although [[Guinness]] has been brewed at the [[St. James's Gate Brewery]] since 1759. Economic improvements in the 1990s attracted a number of global pharmaceutical, information and communications technology companies to the city and [[Greater Dublin Area]]. Companies such as [[Microsoft]], [[Google]], [[Amazon.com|Amazon]], [[eBay]], [[PayPal]], [[Yahoo!]], [[Facebook]], [[Twitter]], [[Accenture]] and [[Pfizer]] now have European headquarters and/or operational bases in the city, with several located in enterprise clusters like the [[The Digital Hub|Digital Hub]] and [[Silicon Docks]]. This presence of these companies has driven economic expansion in the city and led to Dublin sometimes being referred to as the "Tech Capital of Europe".<ref name=":0" />

Financial services have also become important to the city since the establishment of Dublin's [[International Financial Services Centre]] in 1987. More than 500 operations are approved to trade under the IFSC programme. The centre is host to half of the world's top 50 banks and to half of the top 20 insurance companies.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.ifsc.ie/page.aspx?idpage=6|title=I.F.S.C |publisher=I.F.S.C.ie |date= 21 June 2010 |accessdate=21 January 2010}}</ref> Many international firms have established major headquarters in the city, such as [[Citibank]]. The [[Irish Stock Exchange]] (ISEQ), [[Internet Neutral Exchange]] (INEX) and Irish Enterprise Exchange (IEX) are also located in Dublin. Dublin has been positioned as one of the main cities vying to host Financial Services companies hoping to retain access to the Eurozone after [[Brexit]]. The Celtic Tiger also led to a temporary boom in construction, with large redevelopment projects in the [[Dublin Docklands]] and [[Spencer Dock]]. Completed projects include the [[Convention Centre Dublin|Convention Centre]], the [[3Arena]], and the [[Bord Gáis Energy Theatre]].

In the second quarter of 2018, Dublin touched its lowest unemployment rate in a decade, when it fell down to 5.7% as reported by the Dublin Economic Monitor.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.irishexaminer.com/breakingnews/business/monitor-dublin-unemployment-falls-to-lowest-level-in-10-years-amid-economic-resurgence-859553.html|title=Monitor: Dublin unemployment falls to lowest level in 10 years amid economic resurgence|accessdate=2 August 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://issuu.com/256media/docs/dem_aug18?e=16581915/63526870|title=14th issue of the Dublin Economic Monitor|accessdate=1 August 2018}}</ref>

==Transport==
{{Main|Transport in Dublin}}

===Road===
[[File:DublinM50.png|thumb|The [[M50 motorway (Ireland)|M50 motorway]] surrounding Dublin]]
The road network in Ireland is primarily focused on Dublin. The [[M50 motorway (Ireland)|M50 motorway]], a semi-[[ring road]] which runs around the south, west and north of the city, connects important national primary routes to the rest of the country. In 2008, the [[West-Link]] toll bridge was replaced by the [[eFlow]] barrier-free tolling system, with a three-tiered charge system based on electronic tags and car pre-registration.<ref>{{cite web | title = E-Flow Website | publisher=eFlow | url = http://eflow.ie/| accessdate =29 July 2011 }}</ref>

The first phase of a proposed eastern bypass for the city is the [[Dublin Port Tunnel]], which officially opened in 2006 to mainly cater for heavy vehicles. The tunnel connects [[Dublin Port]] and the [[M1 motorway (Republic of Ireland)|M1 motorway]] close to Dublin Airport. The city is also surrounded by an inner and outer orbital route. The inner orbital route runs approximately around the heart of the Georgian city and the outer orbital route runs primarily along the natural circle formed by Dublin's two canals, the [[Grand Canal of Ireland|Grand Canal]] and the [[Royal Canal of Ireland|Royal Canal]], as well as the North and South Circular Roads.

The 2016 [[TomTom]] Traffic Index ranked Dublin the 15th most congested city in the world and the 7th most congested in Europe.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Kelpie|first1=Colm|title=Revealed: Dublin ranked worse than London or Paris for road congestion|url=http://www.independent.ie/business/irish/revealed-dublin-ranked-worse-than-london-or-paris-for-road-congestion-34563994.html|accessdate=20 December 2016|work=The Irish Independent|date=23 March 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=TomTom Traffic Index|url=https://www.tomtom.com/en_ie/trafficindex/list|website=TomTom|accessdate=20 December 2016}}</ref>

====Bus====
Dublin is served by a network of nearly 200 bus routes which cover the city and suburbs. The majority of these are controlled by [[Dublin Bus]], but a number of smaller companies also operate. Fares are generally calculated on a stage system based on distance travelled. There are several different levels of fares, which apply on most services. A "Real Time Passenger Information" system was introduced at Dublin Bus bus stops in 2012. Electronically displayed signs relay information about the time of the next bus' arrival based on its GPS determined position. The [[National Transport Authority (Ireland)|National Transport Authority]] is responsible for integration of bus and rail services in Dublin and has been involved in introducing a pre-paid smart card, called a [[Leap card]], which can be used on all of Dublin's public transport services.

====Cycling====
The 2011 Census showed that 5.9 percent of commuters in Dublin cycled. A 2013 report by Dublin City Council on traffic flows crossing the canals in and out of the city found that just under 10% of all traffic was made up of cyclists, representing an increase of 14.1% over 2012 and an 87.2% increase over 2006 levels and is attributed to measures, such as, the Dublinbikes bike rental scheme, the provision of cycle lanes, public awareness campaigns to promote cycling and the introduction of the 30kph city centre speed limit.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dublincity.ie/sites/default/files/content//RoadsandTraffic/Traffic/Documents/Canal_Cordon_Counts_2013.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150903221013/http://www.dublincity.ie/sites/default/files/content//RoadsandTraffic/Traffic/Documents/Canal_Cordon_Counts_2013.pdf |dead-url=yes |archive-date=3 September 2015 |title=Report on trends in mode share of vehicles and people crossing the Canal Cordon 2006 to 2013 |year=2013 |publisher=[[Dublin City Council]] & National Transport Authority |pages=4, 8, 16 |accessdate=29 August 2015 }}</ref>

===Rail and tram===
[[File:LUAS trams at Tallacht terminus. - geograph.org.uk - 1387090.jpg|thumb|[[Luas]] trams at the [[Tallaght]] terminus]]
[[Dublin Heuston railway station|Heuston]] and [[Dublin Connolly railway station|Connolly]] stations are the two main railway stations in Dublin. Operated by [[Iarnród Éireann]], the [[Dublin Suburban Rail]] network consists of five railway lines serving the Greater Dublin Area and commuter towns such as [[Drogheda]] and [[Dundalk]] in [[County Louth]]. One of these lines is the electrified [[Dublin Area Rapid Transit]] (DART) line, which runs primarily along the coast of Dublin, comprising 31 stations, from [[Malahide]] and [[Howth]] southwards as far as [[Greystones]] in [[County Wicklow]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dublin.ie/transport/dart.htm|title=DART (Dublin Area Rapid Transit)|accessdate=28 July 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721123858/http://www.dublin.ie/transport/dart.htm|archive-date=21 July 2011|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}</ref> [[Commuter (Irish Rail)|Commuter rail]] operates on the other four lines using Irish Rail [[diesel multiple unit]]s. In 2013, passengers for DART and Dublin Suburban lines were 16 million and 11.7 million, respectively (around 75% of all Irish Rail passengers).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cso.ie/px/pxeirestat/Statire/SelectVarVal/Define.asp?maintable=TCA01|title=Passenger Journeys by Rail by Type of Journey and Year - StatBank - data and statistics|publisher=|accessdate=20 April 2016}}</ref>

Dublin once had an extensive system of [[Dublin tramways|trams]] but this was largely phased out by 1949.  A new [[light rail]] system, often described as a tram system, the [[Luas]], was launched in 2004, and is run by [[Transdev|Transdev Ireland]] (under contract from [[Transport Infrastructure Ireland]]), carrying over 34 million passengers annually.<ref name="Luas - Frequently Asked Questions">{{cite web|url=https://www.luas.ie/faq.html|title=Luas - Frequently Asked Questions|website=luas.ie|access-date=1 January 2018}}</ref> The network consists of two interconnecting tram lines; the [[Red Line (Luas)|Red Line]] links the [[Dublin Docklands|Docklands]] and city centre with the south-western suburbs of Tallaght and Saggart, while the [[Green Line (Luas)|Green Line]] connects northern inner city suburbs and the main city centre with suburbs to the south of the city including Sandyford and Brides Glen. Together these lines comprise a total 67 stations and {{convert|44.5|km|mi}} of track.<ref name="Luas - Frequently Asked Questions"/> Construction of a 6&nbsp;km extension to the Green Line, bringing it into the north of the city, commenced in June 2013 and was opened for passenger travel on December 9, 2017.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://luas.ie/luas-cross-city-opening-2pm-sat-9th-dec/|title=Luas Cross City Opened|last=|first=|date=December 2017|website=Luas.ie|publisher=[[Transdev]]|accessdate=14 December 2017}}</ref>

A [[Rapid transit|metro]] service is proposed under the name of [[Dublin Metro|Metrolink]], and planned to run from Dublin's [[Northside, Dublin|northside]] to [[Sandyford]] via [[Dublin Airport]] and [[St. Stephen's Green]], with construction projected to start after 2021.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.independent.ie/irish-news/news/revealed-preferred-route-for-3bn-metrolink-from-city-centre-to-dublin-airport-unveiled-36732780.html|title=Revealed: Preferred route for €3bn MetroLink from city centre to Dublin Airport unveiled|last=Melia|first=Paul|date=2018-03-22|work=Irish Independent|access-date=2018-11-12}}</ref>

===Rail and ferry===
[[Dublin Connolly]] is connected by bus to [[Dublin Port]] and ferries run by [[Irish Ferries]] and [[Stena Line]] to [[Holyhead railway station|Holyhead]] for connecting trains on the [[North Wales Coast Line]] to [[Chester railway station|Chester]], [[Crewe railway station|Crewe]] and [[Euston railway station|London Euston]]. [[Dublin Connolly]] to Dublin Port can be reached via [[Amiens Street, Dublin]] into [[Store Street]] or by Luas via [[Busáras]] where [[Dublin Bus]] operates services to the Ferry Terminal.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dublinbus.ie/en/Your-Journey1/Timetables/All-Timetables/53/|title=53 - Dublin Bus|website=dublinbus.ie}}</ref>

The City of Dublin is the area administered by [[Dublin City Council]], but the term "Dublin" is also used to refer to the contiguous urban area which includes parts of the adjacent local authority areas of [[Dún Laoghaire–Rathdown]], [[Fingal]] and [[South Dublin]]. Together, the four areas form the traditional [[County Dublin]]. This area is sometimes known as the [[Dublin Region]]. The population of the administrative area controlled by the City Council was 554,554 in the 2016 census,<ref name="2016sapmapcity"/> while the population of the urban area was 1,173,179. The County Dublin population was 1,273,069 and that of the [[Greater Dublin Area]] 1,904,806. The area's population is expanding rapidly, and it is estimated by the [[Central Statistics Office (Ireland)|Central Statistics Office]] that it will reach 2.1&nbsp;million by 2020.<ref>[http://www.rte.ie/news/2007/0402/87392-dublin/ Call for improved infrastructure for Dublin] 2 April 2007</ref>
