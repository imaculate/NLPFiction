== Classification ==
There were two clinical forms of smallpox. Variola major was the severe and most common form, with a more extensive rash and higher fever. [[Alastrim|Variola minor]] was a less common presentation, and a much less severe disease, with historical death rates of 1 percent or less.<ref name=FactSheet>{{cite web|url=http://www.bt.cdc.gov/agent/smallpox/overview/disease-facts.asp |title=CDC Smallpox |accessdate=26 December 2007 |work=Smallpox Overview |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130402220850/http://www.bt.cdc.gov/agent/smallpox/overview/disease-facts.asp |archivedate=2 April 2013 |df= }}</ref> Subclinical ([[asymptomatic]]) infections with variola virus were noted but were not common.<ref name= PinkBook /> In addition, a form called ''variola sine eruptione'' (smallpox without rash) was seen generally in vaccinated persons. This form was marked by a fever that occurred after the usual incubation period and could be confirmed only by antibody studies or, rarely, by virus isolation.<ref name= PinkBook />

== Signs and symptoms ==
[[File:Smallpox child.jpg|thumb|upright|A child showing rash due to ordinary-type smallpox (variola major)]]
The [[incubation period]] between contraction and the first obvious symptoms of the disease was around 12 days. Once inhaled, variola major virus invaded the oropharyngeal (mouth and throat) or the [[respiratory]] mucosa, migrated to regional [[lymph nodes]], and began to multiply. In the initial growth phase the virus seemed to move from cell to cell, but around the 12th day, [[lysis]] of many infected cells occurred and the virus was found in the [[blood]]stream in large numbers (this is called ''[[viremia]]''), and a second wave of multiplication occurred in the spleen, [[bone marrow]], and lymph nodes.

The initial symptoms were similar to other viral diseases such as [[influenza]] and the [[common cold]]: [[fever]] of at least {{convert|38.3|°C|°F|0}}, [[myalgia|muscle pain]], malaise, headache and [[prostration]]. As the [[Gastrointestinal tract|digestive tract]] was commonly involved, nausea and vomiting and backache often occurred. The prodrome, or preeruptive stage, usually lasted 2–4 days. By days 12–15 the first visible lesions – small reddish spots called ''[[enanthem]]'' – appeared on mucous membranes of the mouth, tongue, [[palate]], and throat, and temperature fell to near normal. These lesions rapidly enlarged and ruptured, releasing large amounts of virus into the [[saliva]].<ref name="AFIP" />

Smallpox virus preferentially attacked skin cells, causing the characteristic pimples (called [[macule]]s) associated with the disease. A rash developed on the skin 24 to 48 hours after lesions on the mucous membranes appeared. Typically the macules first appeared on the forehead, then rapidly spread to the whole face, proximal portions of extremities, the trunk, and lastly to distal portions of extremities. The process takes no more than 24 to 36 hours, after which no new lesions appear.<ref name="AFIP" /> At this point variola major infection could take several very different courses, resulting in four types of smallpox disease based on the Rao classification:<ref>Rao, A.R. (1972). Smallpox. Bombay: Kothari Book Depot. {{Oclc|723806}}</ref> ordinary, modified, malignant (or flat), and hemorrhagic. Historically, smallpox had an overall [[fatality rate]] of about 30 percent; the malignant and hemorrhagic forms were usually fatal.<ref name="eMedicine_Smallpox">{{Cite journal |vauthors=Hogan CJ, Harchelroad F | title=CBRNE – Smallpox | journal=EMedicine | url=http://www.emedicine.com/emerg/topic885.htm | accessdate=23 September 2006| date=2018-08-22 }}</ref>

=== Ordinary ===
Ninety percent or more of smallpox cases among unvaccinated persons were of the ordinary type.<ref name= PinkBook /> In this form of the disease, by the second day of the rash the macules became raised ''[[papule]]s''. By the third or fourth day the papules filled with an opalescent fluid to become ''[[Vesicle (dermatology)|vesicles]]''. This fluid became [[Opacity (optics)|opaque]] and [[turbid]] within 24–48 hours, giving them the appearance of [[pustule]]s; the so-called pustules were filled with tissue debris, not pus.<ref name= AFIP />

By the sixth or seventh day, all the skin lesions have become pustules. Between seven and ten days the pustules matured and reached their maximum size. The pustules were sharply raised, typically round, tense, and firm to the touch. The pustules were deeply embedded in the dermis, giving them the feel of a small bead in the skin. Fluid slowly leaked from the pustules, and by the end of the second week the pustules deflated, and started to dry up, forming crusts (or scabs). By day 16–20 scabs had formed over all the lesions, which had started to flake off, leaving [[depigmentation|depigmented]] scars.<ref name=training1>{{cite web |url=http://emergency.cdc.gov/agent/smallpox/training/overview/pdf/diseasemgmt.pdf |title=Smallpox Disease and Its Clinical Management |accessdate=26 December 2007 |format=PDF |work=From the training course titled "Smallpox: Disease, Prevention, and Intervention" (www.bt.cdc.gov/agent/smallpox/training/overview)}}</ref>

Ordinary smallpox generally produced a discrete rash, in which the pustules stood out on the skin separately. The distribution of the rash was densest on the face; denser on the extremities than on the trunk; and on the extremities, denser on the distal parts than on the proximal. The palms of the hands and soles of the feet were involved in the majority of cases. Sometimes, the blisters merged into sheets, forming a confluent rash, which began to detach the outer layers of skin from the underlying flesh. Patients with confluent smallpox often remained ill even after scabs had formed over all the lesions. In one case series, the case-fatality rate in confluent smallpox was 62 percent.<ref name= PinkBook />

=== Modified ===
Referring to the character of the eruption and the rapidity of its development, modified smallpox occurred mostly in previously vaccinated people. In this form the prodromal illness still occurred but may have been less severe than in the ordinary type. There was usually no fever during evolution of the rash. The skin lesions tended to be fewer and evolved more quickly, were more superficial, and may not have shown the uniform characteristic of more typical smallpox.<ref name=training1 /> Modified smallpox was rarely, if ever, fatal. This form of variola major was more easily confused with [[chickenpox]].<ref name= PinkBook />

=== Malignant ===
In malignant-type smallpox (also called flat smallpox) the lesions remained almost flush with the skin at the time when raised vesicles would have formed in the ordinary type. It is unknown why some people developed this type. Historically, it accounted for 5–10 percent of cases, and the majority (72 percent) were children.<ref name= Fenner1>{{cite book |author=Fenner, Frank |title=Smallpox and Its Eradication (History of International Public Health, No. 6) |publisher=World Health Organization |location=Geneva |url= http://whqlibdoc.who.int/smallpox/9241561106.pdf |year=1988 |pages= |isbn=978-92-4-156110-5 |format=PDF}}</ref> Malignant smallpox was accompanied by a severe [[prodromal]] phase that lasted 3–4 days, prolonged high fever, and severe symptoms of [[Bacteremia|toxemia]]. The rash on the tongue and palate was extensive. Skin lesions matured slowly and by the seventh or eighth day they were flat and appeared to be buried in the skin. Unlike ordinary-type smallpox, the vesicles contained little fluid, were soft and velvety to the touch, and may have contained hemorrhages. Malignant smallpox was nearly always fatal.<ref name= PinkBook />

=== Hemorrhagic ===
[[File:Hemorrhagic smallpox.jpg|thumb|upright|left|A man with severe hemorrhagic-type smallpox. (Bangladesh, 1975)]]
[[Hemorrhagic]] smallpox was a severe form accompanied by extensive [[Internal bleeding|bleeding into]] the skin, mucous membranes, and gastrointestinal tract. This form developed in approximately 2 percent of infections and occurred mostly in adults.<ref name= PinkBook /> In hemorrhagic smallpox the skin did not blister, but remained smooth. Instead, bleeding occurred under the skin, making it look charred and black,<ref name= PinkBook /> hence this form of the disease was also known as black pox.<ref name=PrestonNY />

In the early, or fulminating form, hemorrhaging appeared on the second or third day as sub-[[conjunctival]] bleeding turned the whites of the eyes deep red. Hemorrhagic smallpox also produced a dusky [[erythema]], [[petechiae]], and hemorrhages in the spleen, kidney, [[serosa]], muscle, and, rarely, the [[epicardium]], [[liver]], [[testes]], [[ovaries]] and [[bladder]]. Death often occurred suddenly between the fifth and seventh days of illness, when only a few insignificant skin lesions were present. A later form of the disease occurred in patients who survived for 8–10 days. The hemorrhages appeared in the early eruptive period, and the rash was flat and did not progress beyond the vesicular stage.<ref name= PinkBook /> Patients in the early stage of disease showed a decrease in [[coagulation factor]]s (e.g. [[platelet]]s, [[prothrombin]], and [[globulin]]) and an increase in circulating [[antithrombin]]. Patients in the late stage had significant [[thrombocytopenia]]; deficiency of coagulation factors was less severe. Some in the late stage also showed increased antithrombin.<ref name= AFIP /> This form of smallpox occurred in anywhere from 3 to 25 percent of fatal cases depending on the virulence of the smallpox strain.<ref name=eMedicine_Smallpox /> Hemorrhagic smallpox was usually fatal.<ref name= PinkBook />

=== Evolution ===

The date of the appearance of smallpox is not settled.

The life cycle of poxviruses is complicated by having multiple infectious forms, with differing mechanisms of cell entry. Poxviruses are unique among DNA viruses in that they replicate in the [[cytoplasm]] of the cell rather than in the [[Cell nucleus|nucleus]]. In order to replicate, poxviruses produce a variety of specialized proteins not produced by other [[DNA viruses]], the most important of which is a viral-associated [[DNA-dependent RNA polymerase]].

Both [[viral envelope|enveloped]] and unenveloped [[virions]] are infectious. The viral envelope is made of modified [[Golgi apparatus|Golgi]] membranes containing viral-specific polypeptides, including [[hemagglutinin]].<ref name=Moss /> Infection with either variola major or variola minor confers immunity against the other.<ref name=AFIP>{{cite web |url=http://www.afip.org/Departments/infectious/sp/text/1_1.htm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071009141639/http://www.afip.org/Departments/infectious/sp/text/1_1.htm |archivedate=9 October 2007 |title=Smallpox |accessdate=28 October 2008 |work=Armed Forces Institute of Pathology: Department of Infectious and Parasitic Diseases}}</ref>

=== Transmission ===
Transmission occurred through inhalation of [[Airborne disease|airborne]] variola virus, usually droplets expressed from the oral, nasal, or [[pharynx|pharyngeal]] [[mucosa]] of an infected person. It was transmitted from one person to another primarily through prolonged face-to-face contact with an infected person, usually within a distance of {{convert|6|ft|m|order=flip|abbr=in}}, but could also be spread through direct contact with infected [[bodily fluid]]s or contaminated objects ([[fomite]]s) such as bedding or clothing. Rarely, smallpox was spread by virus carried in the air in enclosed settings such as buildings, buses, and trains.<ref name= FactSheet /> The virus can cross the [[placenta]], but the incidence of [[congenital]] smallpox was relatively low.<ref name=AFIP />
Smallpox was not notably infectious in the [[prodrome|prodromal]] period and viral shedding was usually delayed until the appearance of the rash, which was often accompanied by [[lesion]]s in the mouth and pharynx. The virus can be transmitted throughout the course of the illness, but this happened most frequently during the first week of the rash, when most of the skin lesions were intact.<ref name= PinkBook /> Infectivity waned in 7 to 10 days when scabs formed over the lesions, but the infected person was contagious until the last smallpox scab fell off.<ref name="pmid10367824">{{cite journal |vauthors=Henderson DA, Inglesby TV, Bartlett JG, Ascher MS, Eitzen E, Jahrling PB, Hauer J, Layton M, McDade J, Osterholm MT, O'Toole T, Parker G, Perl T, Russell PK, Tonat K | title = Smallpox as a biological weapon: medical and public health management.

Smallpox was highly contagious, but generally spread more slowly and less widely than some other viral diseases, perhaps because transmission required close contact and occurred after the onset of the rash. The overall rate of infection was also affected by the short duration of the infectious stage. In [[temperate]] areas, the number of smallpox infections was highest during the winter and spring. In tropical areas, seasonal variation was less evident and the disease was present throughout the year.<ref name= PinkBook /> Age distribution of smallpox infections depended on [[acquired immunity]]. [[Vaccination]] [[immunity (medical)|immunity]] declined over time and was probably lost within thirty years.<ref name=AFIP /> Smallpox was not known to be transmitted by insects or animals and there was no [[asymptomatic carrier]] state.<ref name= PinkBook />

== Diagnosis ==
The clinical definition of smallpox is an illness with acute onset of fever equal to or greater than {{convert|38.3|°C|°F|0}} followed by a rash characterized by firm, deep seated vesicles or pustules in the same stage of development without other apparent cause.<ref name= PinkBook /> When a clinical case was observed, smallpox was confirmed using laboratory tests.

[[Microscope|Microscopically]], poxviruses produce characteristic [[cytoplasmic]] inclusions, the most important of which are known as [[Guarnieri bodies]], and are the sites of [[viral replication]]. Guarnieri bodies are readily identified in skin biopsies stained with hematoxylin and eosin, and appear as pink blobs. They are found in virtually all poxvirus infections but the absence of Guarnieri bodies could not be used to rule out smallpox.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Riedel S |title=Smallpox and biological warfare: a disease revisited |journal=Proc (Bayl Univ Med Cent) |volume=18 |issue=1 |pages=13–20 |date=January 2005 |pmid=16200143 |pmc=1200695 }}</ref> The diagnosis of an orthopoxvirus infection can also be made rapidly by [[electron microscopy|electron microscopic]] examination of pustular fluid or scabs.

Definitive laboratory identification of variola virus involved growing the virus on [[chorioallantoic membrane]] (part of a chicken [[embryo]]) and examining the resulting pock lesions under defined temperature conditions.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cidrap.umn.edu/cidrap/content/bt/smallpox/biofacts/smllpx-summary.html#_Criteria_for_Determining |title= Smallpox: Current, comprehensive information on pathogenesis, microbiology, epidemiology, diagnosis, treatment, and prophylaxis |accessdate=27 December 2007 |work= [[Center for Infectious Disease Research & Policy]]}}</ref> Strains were characterized by [[polymerase chain reaction]] (PCR) and [[restriction fragment length polymorphism]] (RFLP) analysis.

[[Chickenpox]] was commonly confused with smallpox in the immediate post-eradication era. Chickenpox and smallpox could be distinguished by several methods. Unlike smallpox, chickenpox does not usually affect the palms and soles. Additionally, chickenpox pustules are of varying size due to variations in the timing of pustule eruption: smallpox pustules are all very nearly the same size since the viral effect progresses more uniformly. A variety of laboratory methods were available for detecting chickenpox in evaluation of suspected smallpox cases.<ref name= PinkBook />

[[File:Smallpox vaccine.jpg|thumb|Components of a modern smallpox [[vaccination]] kit including the [[diluent]], a vial of Dryvax vaccinia vaccine, and a [[bifurcated needle]].]]
The earliest procedure used to prevent smallpox was [[inoculation]] (known as variolation after the introduction of [[smallpox vaccine]] to avoid possible confusion), which likely occurred in India, Africa, and China well before the practice arrived in Europe.<ref name=Rie2005/> The idea that inoculation originated in India has been challenged, as few of the ancient [[Sanskrit]] medical texts described the process of inoculation.<ref>Wujastyk, Dominik. (1995). "Medicine in India," in ''Oriental Medicine: An Illustrated Guide to the Asian Arts of Healing'', 19–38. Edited by Serindia Publications. London: Serindia Publications. {{ISBN|0-906026-36-9}}. p. 29.</ref> Accounts of inoculation against smallpox in China can be found as early as the late 10th century, and the procedure was widely practiced by the 16th century, during the [[Ming dynasty]].<ref name= Temple>Temple, Robert.

New York: Simon and Schuster, Inc. {{ISBN|0-671-62028-2}}. pp. 135–37.</ref> If successful, inoculation produced lasting [[immunity (medical)|immunity]] to smallpox. Because the person was infected with variola virus, a severe infection could result, and the person could transmit smallpox to others. Variolation had a 0.5–2 percent mortality rate, considerably less than the 20–30 percent mortality rate of the disease.<ref name= PinkBook /> Two reports on the Chinese practice of [[inoculation]] were received by the [[Royal Society]] in London in 1700; one by Dr. [[Martin Lister]] who received a report by an employee of the [[East India Company]] stationed in China and another by [[Clopton Havers]].<ref>{{cite book|title=A History of Immunology|first=Arthur M. |last=Silverstein|page=293|publisher=Academic Press|year=2009|edition=2nd|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2xNYjigte14C|isbn=978-0-08-091946-1 }}.</ref>

[[Lady Mary Wortley Montagu]] observed smallpox inoculation during her stay in the [[Ottoman Empire]], writing detailed accounts of the practice in her letters, and enthusiastically promoted the procedure in England upon her return in 1718.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fordham.edu/Halsall/mod/montagu-smallpox.html |title=Modern History Sourcebook: Lady Mary Wortley Montagu (1689–1762): Smallpox Vaccination in Turkey |publisher=Fordham.edu |accessdate=15 October 2010}}</ref> In 1721, [[Cotton Mather#Smallpox inoculation controversy|Cotton Mather]] and colleagues provoked controversy in Boston by inoculating hundreds. In 1796, [[Edward Jenner]], a doctor in [[Berkeley, Gloucestershire]], rural England, discovered that immunity to smallpox could be produced by inoculating a person with material from a [[cowpox]] lesion. Cowpox is a poxvirus in the same family as variola. Jenner called the material used for inoculation [[vaccine]], from the [[Root (linguistics)|root word]] ''vacca'', which is [[Latin]] for cow. The procedure was much safer than variolation, and did not involve a risk of smallpox transmission. Vaccination to prevent smallpox was soon practiced all over the world. During the 19th century, the cowpox virus used for smallpox vaccination was replaced by [[vaccinia]] virus.  Vaccinia is in the same family as cowpox and variola, but is [[Genetics|genetically]] distinct from both. The origin of vaccinia virus and how it came to be in the vaccine are not known.<ref name= PinkBook /> According to [[Voltaire]] (1742), the Turks derived their use of inoculation from neighbouring [[Circassia]]. Voltaire does not speculate on where the Circassians derived their technique from, though he reports that the Chinese have practiced it "these hundred years".<ref>

The current formulation of smallpox vaccine is a live virus preparation of infectious vaccinia virus. The vaccine is given using a bifurcated (two-pronged) needle that is dipped into the vaccine solution. The needle is used to prick the skin (usually the upper arm) a number of times in a few seconds. If successful, a red and itchy bump develops at the vaccine site in three or four days. In the first week, the bump becomes a large blister (called a "Jennerian vesicle") which fills with pus, and begins to drain. During the second week, the blister begins to dry up and a scab forms. The scab falls off in the third week, leaving a small scar.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bt.cdc.gov/agent/smallpox/vaccination/faq.asp |title=Frequently Asked Questions About Smallpox Vaccine |publisher=Centers for Disease Control and Prevention |date=7 February 2007 |accessdate=28 December 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151116152008/http://www.bt.cdc.gov/agent/smallpox/vaccination/faq.asp |archivedate=16 November 2015 |df= }}</ref>

The [[antibodies]] induced by vaccinia vaccine are cross-protective for other orthopoxviruses, such as monkeypox, cowpox, and variola (smallpox) viruses. Neutralizing antibodies are detectable 10 days after first-time vaccination, and seven days after revaccination. Historically, the vaccine has been effective in preventing smallpox infection in 95 percent of those vaccinated.<ref name= CDCvac /> Smallpox vaccination provides a high level of immunity for three to five years and decreasing immunity thereafter. If a person is vaccinated again later, immunity lasts even longer. Studies of smallpox cases in Europe in the 1950s and 1960s demonstrated that the fatality rate among persons vaccinated less than 10 years before exposure was 1.3 percent; it was 7 percent among those vaccinated 11 to 20 years prior, and 11 percent among those vaccinated 20 or more years prior to infection. By contrast, 52 percent of unvaccinated persons died.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Mack TM |title=Smallpox in Europe, 1950–1971 |journal=J. Infect.

[[File:Smallpox vaccine injection.jpg|thumb|A demonstration by medical personnel on use of a bifurcated needle to deliver the smallpox vaccine, 2002.]]
There are side effects and risks associated with the smallpox vaccine. In the past, about 1 out of 1,000 people vaccinated for the first time experienced serious, but non-life-threatening, reactions, including toxic or [[allergic reaction]] at the site of the vaccination ([[erythema multiforme]]), spread of the vaccinia virus to other parts of the body, and to other individuals. Potentially life-threatening reactions occurred in 14 to 500 people out of every 1 million people vaccinated for the first time. Based on past experience, it is estimated that 1 or 2 people in 1 million (0.000198 percent) who receive the vaccine may die as a result, most often the result of postvaccinial [[encephalitis]] or severe [[necrosis]] in the area of vaccination (called progressive vaccinia).<ref name= CDCvac />

Given these risks, as smallpox became effectively eradicated and the number of naturally occurring cases fell below the number of vaccine-induced illnesses and deaths, routine childhood vaccination was discontinued in the United States in 1972, and was abandoned in most European countries in the early 1970s.<ref name=WHO2007Fact /><ref>{{cite journal |title=Prevalence of antibodies to Vaccinia virus after smallpox vaccination in Italy |url= http://vir.sgmjournals.org/cgi/content/full/86/11/2955 |journal=J.

Smallpox vaccination within three days of exposure will prevent or significantly lessen the severity of smallpox symptoms in the vast majority of people.

== Prognosis ==
[[File:Variola 1.jpg|thumb|upright|A case of smallpox, 1886]]
The overall case-fatality rate for ordinary-type smallpox is about 30 percent, but varies by pock distribution: ordinary type-confluent is fatal about 50–75 percent of the time, ordinary-type semi-confluent about 25–50 percent of the time, in cases where the rash is discrete the case-fatality rate is less than 10 percent. The overall fatality rate for children younger than 1 year of age is 40–50 percent. Hemorrhagic and flat types have the highest fatality rates. The fatality rate for flat-type is 90 percent or greater and nearly 100 percent is observed in cases of hemorrhagic smallpox. The case-fatality rate for variola minor is 1 percent or less.<ref name=training1 /> There is no evidence of chronic or recurrent infection with variola virus.<ref name=training1 />

In fatal cases of ordinary smallpox, death usually occurs between the tenth and sixteenth days of the illness. The cause of death from smallpox is not clear, but the infection is now known to involve multiple organs. Circulating [[immune complex]]es, overwhelming [[viremia]], or an uncontrolled [[immune response]] may be contributing factors.<ref name=PinkBook /> In early hemorrhagic smallpox, death occurs suddenly about six days after the fever develops. Cause of death in hemorrhagic cases involved [[heart failure]], sometimes accompanied by [[pulmonary edema]]. In late hemorrhagic cases, high and sustained viremia, severe [[platelet]] loss and poor immune response were often cited as causes of death.<ref name= Fenner1 /> In flat smallpox modes of death are similar to those in burns, with loss of fluid, protein and [[electrolyte]]s beyond the capacity of the body to replace or acquire, and fulminating [[sepsis]].<ref name=Fenner4>{{cite book |author=Fenner, Frank |title=Smallpox and Its Eradication (History of International Public Health, No. 6) |publisher=World Health Organization |location=Geneva |year=1988 |chapter=Development of the Global Smallpox Eradication Programme |chapterurl=http://whqlibdoc.who.int/smallpox/9241561106_chp9.pdf |pages=31, 125 |isbn=978-92-4-156110-5 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>

=== Complications ===
Complications of smallpox arise most commonly in the [[respiratory system]] and range from simple [[bronchitis]] to fatal [[pneumonia]]. Respiratory complications tend to develop on about the eighth day of the illness and can be either viral or bacterial in origin. Secondary [[bacteria]]l infection of the skin is a relatively uncommon complication of smallpox. When this occurs, the fever usually remains elevated.<ref name=PinkBook />

Other complications include [[encephalitis]] (1 in 500 patients), which is more common in adults and may cause temporary disability; permanent pitted scars, most notably on the face; and complications involving the eyes (2 percent of all cases). Pustules can form on the eyelid, [[conjunctiva]], and [[cornea]], leading to complications such as [[conjunctivitis]], [[keratitis]], [[corneal ulcer]], [[iritis]], [[iridocyclitis]], and optic [[atrophy]]. [[Blindness]] results in approximately 35 percent to 40 percent of eyes affected with keratitis and corneal ulcer. Hemorrhagic smallpox can cause subconjunctival and [[retina]]l hemorrhages. In 2 to 5 percent of young children with smallpox, virions reach the joints and bone, causing ''[[osteomyelitis]] variolosa''. Lesions are symmetrical, most common in the elbows, [[tibia]], and [[fibula]], and characteristically cause separation of an [[epiphysis]] and marked [[periosteum|periosteal]] reactions. Swollen joints limit movement, and [[arthritis]] may lead to limb deformities, [[ankylosis]], malformed bones, flail joints, and stubby fingers.<ref name=AFIP />

By the mid-18th century smallpox was a major [[Endemic (epidemiology)|endemic disease]] everywhere in the world except in Australia and in several small islands. In Europe smallpox was a leading cause of death in the 18th century, killing an estimated 400,000 Europeans each year.<ref>{{cite web |author1=Stanley A Plotkin |author2=Walter A Orenstein |author3=Donald A.

Improved vaccines and the practice of re-vaccination led to a substantial reduction in cases in Europe and North America, but smallpox remained almost unchecked everywhere else in the world. In the United States and South Africa a much milder form of smallpox, ''variola minor'', was recognized just before the close of the 19th century. By the mid-20th century ''variola minor'' occurred along with ''variola major'', in varying proportions, in many parts of Africa. Patients with ''variola minor'' experience only a mild systemic illness, are often [[walk|ambulant]] throughout the course of the disease, and are therefore able to more easily spread disease. Infection with ''v. minor'' induces immunity against the more deadly ''variola major'' form. Thus as ''v. minor'' spread all over the US, into Canada, the South American countries and Great Britain it became the dominant form of smallpox, further reducing mortality rates.<ref name= Fenner1 />

People would then develop a mild case of the disease and from then on were immune to it. The technique did have a 0.5–2.0% mortality rate, but that was considerably less than the 20–30% mortality rate of the disease itself.

[[File:Rahima Banu.jpg|thumb|upright|Two-year-old [[Rahima Banu]] of Bangladesh (pictured) was the last person infected with naturally occurring ''Variola major'', in 1975]]
In the early 1950s an estimated 50 million cases of smallpox occurred in the world each year.<ref name=WHO2007Fact /> To eradicate smallpox, each outbreak had to be stopped from spreading, by isolation of cases and vaccination of everyone who lived close by. This process is known as "ring vaccination". The key to this strategy was the monitoring of cases in a community (known as surveillance) and containment. The initial problem the WHO team faced was inadequate reporting of smallpox cases, as many cases did not come to the attention of the authorities. The fact that humans are the only reservoir for smallpox infection, and that [[asymptomatic carrier|carriers]] did not exist, played a significant role in the eradication of smallpox. The WHO established a network of consultants who assisted countries in setting up surveillance and containment activities. Early on, donations of vaccine were provided primarily by the Soviet Union and the United States, but by 1973, more than 80 percent of all vaccine was produced in developing countries.<ref name=Plotkin_1999 />

The last major European outbreak of smallpox was in [[1972 outbreak of smallpox in Yugoslavia|1972 in Yugoslavia]], after a pilgrim from [[Kosovo]] returned from the Middle East, where he had contracted the virus. The epidemic infected 175 people, causing 35 deaths. Authorities declared [[martial law]], enforced quarantine, and undertook widespread re-vaccination of the population, enlisting the help of the WHO. In two months, the outbreak was over.<ref>{{cite journal |first=Colette |last=Flight |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/british/empire_seapower/smallpox_03.shtml |title=Smallpox: Eradicating the Scourge |journal=[[BBC History]] |date=17 February 2011 |accessdate=28 July 2015}}</ref> Prior to this, there had been a smallpox outbreak in May–July 1963 in [[Stockholm]], Sweden, brought from the [[Far East]] by a Swedish sailor; this had been dealt with by quarantine measures and vaccination of the local population.<ref>{{cite journal | title = International Notes – Quarantine Measures Smallpox – Stockholm, Sweden, 1963 | url = https://www.cdc.gov/MMWR/preview/mmwrhtml/00042757.htm |journal = MMWR | year = 1996 | volume = 45 | issue = 25 | pages = 538–45 | pmid = 9132571 | author1 = Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)}}</ref>

By the end of 1975, smallpox persisted only in the [[Horn of Africa]]. Conditions were very difficult in Ethiopia and Somalia, where there were few roads. Civil war, famine, and refugees made the task even more difficult. An intensive surveillance and containment and vaccination program was undertaken in these countries in early and mid-1977, under the direction of Australian microbiologist [[Frank Fenner]]. As the campaign neared its goal, Fenner and his team played an important role in verifying eradication.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/11/26/world/26fenner.html |title=Frank Fenner Dies at 95|work= NYTimes.com|accessdate=27 November 2010|first=William|last=Grimes|date=25 November 2010}}</ref> The last naturally occurring case of indigenous smallpox (''Variola minor'') was diagnosed in [[Ali Maow Maalin]], a hospital cook in Merca, [[Somalia]], on 26 October 1977.<ref name= PinkBook /> The last naturally occurring case of the more deadly ''Variola major'' had been detected in October 1975 in a two-year-old [[Bangladesh]]i girl, [[Rahima Banu]].<ref name=PrestonNY>{{cite news |first=Richard |last=Preston |authorlink=Richard Preston |title=A reporter at large: Demon in the Freezer |url=http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/1999/07/12/the-demon-in-the-freezer |work=The New Yorker |publisher= |date=12 July 1999 |accessdate=3 January 2008 }}</ref>

In March 2004, smallpox [[Coagulation|scabs]] were found inside an envelope in a book on [[American Civil War|Civil War]] medicine in [[Santa Fe, New Mexico]].<ref name=USA_Today_20031226>{{cite news|title=Century-old smallpox scabs in N.M. envelope| work=USA Today: Health and Behavior|url=https://www.usatoday.com/news/health/2003-12-26-smallpox-in-envelope_x.htm|accessdate= 23 September 2006 | date=26 December 2003}}</ref> The envelope was labeled as containing scabs from a vaccination and gave scientists at the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] an opportunity to study the history of smallpox vaccination in the United States.

On July 1, 2014, six sealed glass vials of smallpox dated 1954, along with sample vials of other pathogens, were discovered in a cold storage room in an FDA laboratory at the [[National Institutes of Health]] location in [[Bethesda, Maryland]].

In 2017, Canadian scientists recreated an extinct [[horse pox]] virus to demonstrate that the smallpox virus can be recreated in a small lab at a cost of about $100,000, by a team of scientists without specialist knowledge. This makes the retention controversy moot since the virus can be easily recreated even if all samples are destroyed. Although the scientists performed the research to help development of new vaccines as well as trace smallpox's history, the possibility of the techniques being used for nefarious purposes was immediately recognized, leading to new regulation questions.<ref>{{citeweb|url=http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2017/07/how-canadian-researchers-built-poxvirus-100000-using-mail-order-dna|title=How Canadian researchers reconstituted an extinct poxvirus for $100,000 using mail-order DNA|publisher=Science Magazine|date=6 July 2017}}</ref>

=== Biological warfare ===
The British used smallpox as a [[biological warfare]] agent at the [[Siege of Fort Pitt]] during the [[French and Indian Wars]] (1754–1763) against France and its [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] allies.<ref>Peckham, ''Indian Uprising'', 226; Anderson, ''Crucible of War'', 542, 809n.</ref><ref>Anderson, ''Crucible of War'', 809n; Grenier, ''First Way of War'', 144; Nester, ''Haughty Conquerors"'', 114–15.</ref> The actual use of smallpox had official sanction. British officers, including the top British commanding generals, ordered, sanctioned, paid for and conducted the use of smallpox against the Native Americans. As described by historians, "there is no doubt that British military authorities approved of attempts to spread smallpox among the enemy", and "it was deliberate British policy to infect the Indians with smallpox".<ref name="Dixon">Dixon, David; [https://books.google.com/books?id=UeaN0-Ra64oC&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_ge_summary_r&cad=0#v=onepage&q&f=false Never Come to Peace Again: Pontiac's Uprising and the Fate of the British Empire in North America]; (pp. 152–55); University of Oklahoma Press; 2005; {{ISBN|0-8061-3656-1}}</ref>  On 24 June 1763, William Trent, a local trader and commander of the Fort Pitt militia, wrote, "Out of our regard for them, we gave them two Blankets and an Handkerchief out of the Small Pox Hospital.

According to a theory put forward in ''Journal of Australian Studies'' (JAS) by an independent researcher, in 1789, British marines used smallpox against indigenous tribes in [[New South Wales]].<ref>{{cite journal|last=Warren|first= Christopher|title=Smallpox at Sydney Cove – who, when, why?|journal= Journal of Australian Studies|url= http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/14443058.2013.849750#preview|doi= 10.1080/14443058.2013.849750|volume=38|year=2013|pages=68–86}}</ref>  This occasion was also discussed earlier in ''Bulletin of the History of Medicine''<ref>"Smallpox and Cowpox Under the Southern Cross: The Smallpox Epidemic of 1789", Vol. 83 pt. 1, pp. 37–62.</ref> and by David Day in his book ''Claiming a Continent: A New History of Australia''.<ref>HarperCollinsPublishers, Sydney, 2001, pp. 42ff.</ref>   Prior to the JAS article this theory was disputed by some academics.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/radionational/programs/ockhamsrazor/chicken-pox-or-smallpox-in-the-colony-at-sydney/2972652#transcript|title=Chicken pox or smallpox in the colony at Sydney Cove in April, 1789|work=Radio National|date=2010-09-17}}</ref> Jack Carmody claimed the cause of the outbreak in question was more likely due to chickenpox, which at the time was sometimes identified as a mild form of smallpox.  While it was noted that, in the 8-month voyage of the First Fleet and the following 14 months there were no reports of smallpox amongst the colonists and that as smallpox has an incubation period of 10–12 days it is unlikely it was present in the first fleet, it is now known that the likely source was bottles of smallpox virus possessed by  [[First Fleet#First Fleet smallpox|First Fleet]] surgeons and there actually was a report of smallpox amongst the colonists – a seaman, Jefferies.

There is circumstantial evidence that smallpox was deliberately introduced to Aboriginal population.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Carus |first1=WS |title=The History of Biological Weapons Use: What We Know and What We Don't|journal=Health Security |date=2015 |volume=13 |issue=4 |pages=219–55 |doi=10.1089/hs.2014.0092 |pmid=26221997}}</ref>

(See [[Mozart and smallpox]].)]]

Famous historical figures who contracted smallpox include Lakota Chief [[Sitting Bull]], [[Ramses V]] of [[Egypt]],<ref name="Koplow 2003">{{cite book|last=Koplow|first=David|title=Smallpox: The Fight to Eradicate a Global Scourge|publisher=University of California Press|year=2003|location=Berkeley and Los Angeles|isbn=978-0-520-23732-2}}</ref> the [[Kangxi Emperor]] (survived), [[Shunzhi Emperor]] and [[Tongzhi Emperor]] (refer to the official history) of China, [[Emperor Komei]] of Japan (died of smallpox in 1867), and [[Date Masamune]] of Japan (who lost an eye to the disease). [[Cuitláhuac]], the 10th [[tlatoani]] (ruler) of the [[Aztec]] city of [[Tenochtitlan]], died of smallpox in 1520, shortly after its introduction to the [[Americas]], and the Incan emperor [[Huayna Capac]] died of it in 1527. More recent public figures include [[Guru Har Krishan]], 8th Guru of the Sikhs, in 1664, [[Peter II of Russia]] in 1730 (died),<ref name="doctorzebra.com">{{cite web|title=President Abraham Lincoln: Health & Medical History|url= http://www.doctorzebra.com/prez/g16.htm#25|date=24 March 2007|accessdate=18 June 2007}}</ref> [[George Washington]] (survived), king [[Louis XV]] in 1774 (died) and [[Maximilian III Joseph, Elector of Bavaria]] in 1777.

Prominent families throughout the world often had several people infected by and/or perish from the disease. For example, several relatives of [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]] survived the disease but were scarred by it. These include his sister [[Margaret Tudor|Margaret, Queen of Scotland]], his fourth wife, [[Anne of Cleves]], and his two daughters: [[Mary I of England]] in 1527 and [[Elizabeth I of England]] in 1562 (as an adult she would often try to disguise the pockmarks with heavy makeup). His great-niece, [[Mary, Queen of Scots]], contracted the disease as a child but had no visible scarring.

In Europe, deaths from smallpox often changed dynastic succession. The only surviving son of [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]], [[Edward VI of England|Edward VI]], died from complications shortly after apparently recovering from the disease, thereby nullifying Henry's efforts to ensure a male successor to the throne (his two immediate successors were both women, who had both had it and survived). [[Louis XV of France]] succeeded his great-grandfather [[Louis XIV]] through a series of deaths of smallpox or measles among those earlier in the succession line. He himself died of the disease in 1774. [[William III of England|William III]] lost his mother to the disease when he was only ten years old in 1660, and named his uncle [[Charles II of England|Charles]] as legal guardian: her death from smallpox would indirectly spark a chain of events that would eventually lead to the permanent ousting of the Stuart line from the British throne. William III's wife, [[Mary II of England]], died from smallpox as well.

In Russia, [[Peter II of Russia]] died of the disease at 15 years of age. Also, prior to becoming [[Russian Empire|Russian Emperor]], [[Peter III of Russia|Peter III]] caught the virus and suffered greatly from it. He was left scarred and disfigured. His wife, [[Catherine the Great]], was spared but fear of the virus clearly had its effects on her. She feared for her son and heir [[Paul I of Russia|Pavel's]] safety so much that she made sure that large crowds were kept at bay and sought to isolate him. Eventually, she decided to have herself inoculated by a [[Scotland|Scottish]] doctor, [[Thomas Dimsdale]]. While this was considered a controversial method at the time, she succeeded. Her son Pavel was later inoculated as well. Catherine then sought to have inoculations throughout her empire stating: "My objective was, through my example, to save from death the multitude of my subjects who, not knowing the value of this technique, and frightened of it, were left in danger." By 1800, approximately 2 million inoculations were administered in the Russian Empire.<ref>Massie, Robert K. (2011). ''Catherine the Great: Portrait of as Woman'', pp. 387–88.

=== Tradition and religion ===
[[File:Kalighat Shitala.jpg|thumb|The Hindu goddess [[Shitala]] was worshipped to prevent or cure smallpox.]]
In the face of the devastation of smallpox, various smallpox gods and goddesses have been worshipped throughout parts of the [[Old World]], for example in China and in India. In China, the smallpox goddess was referred to as T'ou-Shen Niang-Niang.<ref name="HopkinsDonald">Hopkins, Donald R. Princes and Peasants: Smallpox in History. United States of America: University of Chicago Press, 1983.</ref> Chinese believers actively worked to appease the goddess and pray for her mercy, by such measures as referring to smallpox pustules as "beautiful flowers" as a [[euphemism]] intended to avert offending the goddess, for example (the Chinese word for smallpox is 天花, literally "heaven flower").<ref name="GiblinJames">Giblin, James C. When Plague Strikes: The Black Death, Smallpox, AIDS. United States of America: HarperCollins Publishers, 1995.</ref> In a related New Year's Eve custom it was prescribed that the children of the house wear ugly masks while sleeping, so as to conceal any beauty and thereby avoid attracting the goddess, who would be passing through sometime that night.<ref name="GiblinJames" /> If a case of smallpox did occur, shrines would be set up in the homes of the victims, to be worshipped and offered to as the disease ran its course. If the victim recovered, the shrines were removed and carried away in a special paper chair or boat for burning. If the patient did not recover, the shrine was destroyed and cursed, so as to expel the goddess from the house.<ref name="HopkinsDonald" />

India's first records of smallpox can be found in a medical book that dates back to 400 CE. This book describes a disease that sounds exceptionally like smallpox.<ref name="GiblinJames" /> India, like China, created a goddess in response to its exposure to smallpox. The Hindu goddess [[Shitala]] was both worshipped and feared during her reign. It was believed that this goddess was both evil and kind and had the ability to inflict victims when angered, as well as calm the fevers of the already afflicted.<ref>Wiley, Andrea S., & Allen, John S. Medical Anthropology: A Biocultural Approach. New York: Oxford University Press, 2009.</ref> Portraits of the goddess show her holding a broom in her right hand to continue to move the disease and a pot of cool water in the other hand in an attempt to soothe victims.<ref name="GiblinJames" /> Shrines were created where many India natives, both healthy and not, went to worship and attempt to protect themselves from this disease. Some Indian women, in an attempt to ward off Shitala, placed plates of cooling foods and pots of water on the roofs of their homes.<ref>Tucker, Jonathan B. Scourge: The Once and Future Threat of Smallpox. New York: Atlantic Monthly Press, 2001.</ref>

In cultures that did not recognize a smallpox deity, there was often nonetheless a belief in [[smallpox demon]]s, who were accordingly blamed for the disease. Such beliefs were prominent in Japan, Europe, Africa, and other parts of the world. Nearly all cultures who believed in the demon also believed that it was afraid of the color red. This led to the invention of so-called red treatment, where victims and their rooms would be decorated in red. The practice spread to Europe in the 12th century and was practiced by (among others) [[Charles V of France]] and [[Elizabeth I of England]].<ref name=Fenn1988 /> Afforded scientific credibility through the studies by Finsen showing that red light reduced scarring,<ref name=Fenn1988 /> this belief persisted even until the 1930s.
