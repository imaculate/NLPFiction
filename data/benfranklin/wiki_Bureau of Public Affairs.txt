==Office of Regional Media Outreach==
The Office of Regional Media Outreach (RMO) provides local, regional, specialty, and national media a central connection point to department newsmakers.

Their database of newsmakers enables members of the media to quickly find an expert at the department to provide insight, analysis, and expertise on foreign affairs, news and events. Searches can be made by name, issue, position or language spoken. Once an expert has been identified, their staff will set up an interview for television, radio, or print media.

They list their 47 available experts.<ref>[http://newsmaker.state.gov/contactresultsall.aspx Newsmakers]{{dead link|date=December 2013}}</ref>
