'''Peter Folger''' or '''Foulger''' (1617&nbsp;–1690) was a poet and an [[interpreter]] of the [[Native Americans in the United States|American Indian]] language for the first settlers of [[Nantucket]]. He was instrumental in the colonization of Nantucket Island in the [[Massachusetts]] colony. He was the maternal grandfather of [[Benjamin Franklin]].<ref>{{cite book

A Baptist missionary, teacher, and surveyor, his dealings with the native population promoted harmony between the Native Americans and European settlers.

==Life==
Peter Folger was born in 1617 in England, the son of John Folger Jr. (b. c. 1594) and Meribah Gibbs.<ref>[https://books.google.ca/books?id=3JQK3D3y2XgC&pg=PA740&dq=Meribah+Gibbs+John+Folger&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjnwsGsg8nWAhVCzlQKHeG_CwsQ6AEIFDAA]</ref> He came to America in 1635, settling initially in [[Watertown, Massachusetts]], and later moving to [[Martha's Vineyard]],<ref>{{cite book|last=Trent|first=William Peterfield|author2=Benjamin Willis Wells|title=Colonial Prose and Poetry |publisher=Thomas Y.

In 1644, he married [[Mary Morrell Folger|Mary Morrell]], whom he met on the voyage from England.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ALIUAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA269&dq=peter+folger&as_brr=3|title=New England Historical and Genealogical Register, Vol 16|last=|first=|publisher=Samuel G.

At the Vineyard, Folger supported himself by teaching school and surveying land. He was hired by Governor [[Thomas Mayhew]] and his son Thomas Mayhew Jr. to convert the [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] population to Christianity, during which time he learned to speak the native language. He was a Baptist in faith, and as such was told not to visit with the Puritans on the mainland. Rev. [[Experience Mayhew]], in a letter to John Gardner, Esquire, dated 1694, states that when Thomas Mayhew, Jr. left for England in 1657, he left the care of his church and mission to Peter Folger.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Cutter|first1=William|title=American Biography: A New Cyclopedia, Volume 12|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vWoKAQAAMAAJ&pg=PA95&lpg=PA95&dq=peter+Folger+++thomas+mayhew&source=bl&ots=OZ3GjQP_s_&sig=V4wiCWPy_3JuQHmg1iOTrTWMu70&hl=en&sa=X&ei=S5JcVYm4I8uMNtDMgagO&ved=0CDUQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&q=peter%20Folger%20%20%20thomas%20mayhew&f=false}}</ref>

From time to time between 1659 and 1662, Folger journeyed to Nantucket in order to survey it for the proprietors. In 1663 Folger moved to Nantucket full-time, having been granted a half a share of land by the proprietors, where he was a surveyor, an Indian interpreter, and clerk in the courts. Shortly thereafter, Folger's daughter, Abiah, was born, later to become the mother of [[Benjamin Franklin]],<ref>{{cite book|last=Worron|first=Harriet B.|title="Trustum" and His Grandchildren|year=1881|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yLkpc0vsrrwC&pg=PA36&dq=peter+folger}}</ref> who referred to him fondly in his autobiography.

Folger died at [[Nantucket]], Massachusetts, in 1690 and is buried in the Founders Burial Ground.<ref name="Founders Burial Ground">{{cite web|url=https://www.nha.org/library/cemeteries/infofounders.htm |title=Nantucket Founders Burial Ground Information |website=Nantucket Historical Association |accessdate=February 14, 2017}}</ref> His wife Mary Morrill Folger lived until 1704.<ref name="Sparks">{{cite book|author=Jared Sparks|title=The Works of Benjamin Franklin: Containing Several Political and Historical Tracts Not Included in Any Former Edition, and Many Letters, Official and Private, Not Hitherto Published; with Notes and a Life of the Author|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=w1sOAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA543|year=1844|publisher=C.
