The '''National Football League''' ('''NFL''') is a professional [[American football]] [[Sports league|league]] consisting of 32 teams, divided equally between the [[National Football Conference]] (NFC) and the [[American Football Conference]] (AFC). The NFL is one of the four [[Major professional sports leagues in the United States and Canada|major professional sports leagues]] in North America, and the highest professional level of American football in the world.<ref>{{cite book|title=Sports Capitalism: The Foreign Business of American Professional Leagues|first=Frank P.|last=Jozsa| publisher=[[Ashgate Publishing]]|year=2004| isbn=978-0-7546-4185-8|page=270|quote=Since 1922, [the NFL] has been the top professional sports league in the world with respect to American football}}</ref> The NFL's [[National Football League regular season|17-week regular season]] runs from early September to late December, with each team playing 16 games and having one [[Bye (sports)#Gridiron football and Major League Baseball|bye week]]. Following the conclusion of the regular season, six teams from each conference (four division winners and two wild card teams) advance to the [[NFL playoffs|playoffs]], a [[single-elimination tournament]] culminating in the [[Super Bowl]], which is usually held in the first Sunday in February, and is played between the champions of the NFC and AFC.

The NFL was formed in 1920 as the '''American Professional Football Association''' ('''APFA''') before renaming itself the National Football League for the [[1922 NFL season|1922 season]]. The NFL [[AFL–NFL merger|agreed to merge]] with the [[American Football League]] (AFL) in 1966, and the [[Super Bowl I|first Super Bowl]] was held at the end of that season; the merger was completed in 1970.

==History==
{{Main|History of the National Football League}}

===Founding and history===
On August 20, 1920, a meeting was held by representatives of the [[Akron Pros]], [[Canton Bulldogs]], [[Cleveland Tigers (NFL)|Cleveland Indians]], and [[Dayton Triangles]] at the Jordan and [[Hupmobile]] auto showroom in [[Canton, Ohio]].<ref name="profootballhof.com">{{cite web|url=http://www.profootballhof.com/news/nfl-founded-in-canton/|title=NFL founded in Canton - Pro Football Hall of Fame Official Site|website=www.profootballhof.com}}</ref> This meeting resulted in the formation of the American Professional Football Conference (APFC), a group who, according to the ''Canton Evening Repository'', intended to "raise the standard of professional football in every way possible, to eliminate bidding for players between rival clubs and to secure cooperation in the formation of schedules".<ref name="Happy Birthday NFL?" /> 

Another meeting was held on September 17, 1920 with representatives from teams  from four states-Akron, Canton, Cleveland, and Dayton from Ohio; the [[Hammond Pros]] and [[Muncie Flyers]] from Indiana; the [[Rochester Jeffersons]] from New York; and the [[Rock Island Independents]], [[Chicago Bears|Decatur Staleys]], and [[Arizona Cardinals|Racine (Chicago) Cardinals]] from Illinois.[http://www.profootballhof.com/football-history/history-of-football/1869-1939/1920-american-professional-football-conference-is-formed/] The league was renamed to the American Professional Football Association (APFA).<ref name="Happy Birthday NFL?">{{cite journal|year=1980 |title=Happy Birthday NFL? |journal=The Coffin Corner |publisher=[[Professional Football Researchers Association]] |volume=2 |issue=8 |url=http://www.profootballresearchers.org/Coffin_Corner/02-08-038.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090206155110/http://profootballresearchers.org/Coffin_Corner/02-08-038.pdf |dead-url=yes |archive-date=February 6, 2009 |accessdate=February 7, 2013 |df= }}</ref> The league elected [[Jim Thorpe]] as its first president, and consisted of 14 teams (the [[Buffalo (NFL)|Buffalo All-Americans]], [[Chicago Tigers]], [[Columbus Panhandles]], and [[Detroit (1920s NFL teams)|Detroit Heralds]] joined the league during the year). The [[Massillon Tigers]] from [[Massillon, Ohio]] was also at the September 17 meeting, but did not field a team in 1920.

In [[1932 NFL season|1932]], the season ended with the Chicago Bears (6–1–6) and the [[Portsmouth Spartans]] (6–1–4) tied for first in the league standings.<ref name="1925–1937">Past Standings, p. 26</ref> At the time, teams were ranked on a single table and the team with the highest [[winning percentage]] (not including ties, which were not counted towards the standings) at the end of the season was declared the champion; the only tiebreaker was that in the event of a tie, if two teams played twice in a season, the result of the second game determined the title (the source of the 1921 controversy). This method had been used since the league's creation in 1920, but no situation had been encountered where two teams were tied for first. The league quickly determined that a [[1932 NFL Playoff Game|playoff game]] between Chicago and Portsmouth was needed to decide the league's champion. The teams were originally scheduled to play the playoff game, officially a regular season game that would count towards the regular season standings, at [[Wrigley Field]] in Chicago, but a combination of heavy snow and extreme cold forced the game to be moved indoors to [[Chicago Stadium]], which did not have a regulation-size football field. Playing with altered rules to accommodate the smaller playing field, the Bears won the game 9–0 and thus won the championship. Fan interest in the ''de facto'' championship game led the NFL, beginning in [[1933 NFL season|1933]], to split into [[Eastern and Western Conferences (NFL) 1933–69|two divisions]] with a championship game to be played between the division champions.<ref name="The 60-Yard Circus">{{cite web|url=http://www.profootballresearchers.org/Articles/1932%20Season.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100929180027/http://profootballresearchers.org/Articles/1932%20Season.pdf|dead-url=yes|archive-date=September 29, 2010|title=The 60-Yard Circus|last=Carroll|first=Bob|publisher=[[Professional Football Researchers Association]]|accessdate=February 9, 2013}}</ref> The [[1934 NFL season|1934 season]] also marked the first of 12 seasons in which African Americans were [[Black players in professional American football|absent from the league]].

The NFL was always the foremost professional football league in the United States; it nevertheless faced a large number of rival professional leagues through the 1930s and 1940s. Rival leagues included at least three separate [[American Football League (disambiguation)|American Football Leagues]] and the [[All-America Football Conference]] (AAFC), on top of various regional leagues of varying caliber. Three NFL teams trace their histories to these rival leagues, including the [[Los Angeles Rams]] (who came from a 1936 iteration of the American Football League), the [[Cleveland Browns]] and [[San Francisco 49ers]] (the last two of which came from the AAFC). By the 1950s, the NFL had an effective monopoly on professional football in the United States; its only competition in North America was the professional [[Canadian football]] circuit, which formally became the [[Canadian Football League]] (CFL) in 1958. With Canadian football being [[Comparison of American and Canadian football|a different football code]] than the American game, the CFL established a niche market in Canada and still survives as an independent league.

A new professional league, the fourth [[American Football League]] (AFL), began play in 1960. The upstart AFL began to challenge the established NFL in popularity, gaining lucrative television contracts and engaging in a bidding war with the NFL for free agents and draft picks. The two leagues announced a [[AFL–NFL merger|merger]] on June 8, 1966, to take full effect in 1970. In the meantime, the leagues would hold a common draft and championship game. The game, the [[Super Bowl]], was held four times before the merger, with the NFL winning [[Super Bowl I]] and [[Super Bowl II]], and the AFL winning [[Super Bowl III]] and [[Super Bowl IV]].<ref name="Off-the-field competition yields game-changing merger">{{cite news|url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/football/news/2001/01/22/afl_history_2/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20010215044251/http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/football/news/2001/01/22/afl_history_2/ |dead-url=yes |archive-date=February 15, 2001 |title=Off-the-field competition yields game-changing merger |last=Cross |first=B.

Today, the NFL is considered{{clarify|date=June 2017}} the most popular sports league in North America; much of its growth is attributed to former Commissioner [[Pete Rozelle]], who led the league from 1960 to 1989. Overall annual attendance increased from three million at the beginning of his tenure to seventeen million by the end of his tenure, and 400 million viewers watched 1989's [[Super Bowl XXIII]]. The NFL established [[National Football League Properties|NFL Properties]] in 1963. The league's licensing wing, NFL Properties earns the league billions of dollars annually; Rozelle's tenure also marked the creation of [[NFL Charities]] and a national partnership with [[United Way of America|United Way]].<ref name="Encyclopedia of International Sports Studies">{{cite book|title=Encyclopedia of International Sports Studies|editor1=Bartlett, Roger |editor2=Gratton, Chris |editor3=Rolf, Christer |publisher=[[Routledge]]|date=October 26, 2009|pages=932–933|isbn=978-0415561471|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=t6CaJM_BXR0C&pg=PA933&dq=Encyclopedia+NFL&hl=en&sa=X&ei=ZmrEUfG7O4XN0wGN5IGIAw&ved=0CEUQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&q=Encyclopedia%20NFL&f=false|accessdate=June 21, 2013}}</ref> [[Paul Tagliabue]] was elected as commissioner to succeed Rozelle; his seventeen-year tenure, which ended in 2006, was marked by large increases in television contracts and the addition of four expansion teams,<ref name="The Legacy of Tagliabue?">{{cite news|url=http://fifthdown.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/02/02/the-legacy-of-tagliabue/|title=The Legacy of Tagliabue?|last=Evans|first=Thayer|date=February 2, 2008|work=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=June 27, 2013}}</ref> as well as the introduction of league initiatives to increase the number of minorities in league and team management roles.<ref name="Report Card: Tagliabue's legacy includes new model for racial hiring">{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/columns/story?columnist=lapchick_richard&id=2552322|title=Report Card: Tagliabue's legacy includes new model for racial hiring|last=Lapchick |first=Richard|date=August 17, 2006|publisher=[[ESPN.com]]|accessdate=June 27, 2013}}</ref> The league's current Commissioner, [[Roger Goodell]], has focused on reducing the number of illegal hits and making the sport safer, mainly through fining or suspending players who break rules.<ref name="Roger Goodell's authority takes a hit">{{cite web|last=Taylor|first=Jean-Jacques|title=Roger Goodell's authority takes a hit|url=http://espn.go.com/dallas/nfl/story/_/id/8741639/nfl-commissioner-roger-goodell-invulnerable-authority-takes-hit-overturned-suspensions|publisher=[[ESPN.com]]|accessdate=December 13, 2012}}</ref> These actions are among many the NFL is taking to reduce [[concussion]]s and improve player safety.<ref name="Violent hits keep coming, so is NFL changing culture?">{{cite news|last=Brady|first=Erik|title=Violent hits keep coming, so is NFL changing culture?|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nfl/2013/09/16/malcom-floyd-brandon-meriwaether-concussions-suspended/2823717/|work=[[USA Today]]|accessdate=September 22, 2013|author2=Gary Mihoces|date=September 16, 2013}}</ref>

===Season and playoff development===
{{Main|List of National Football League seasons}}
From 1920 to 1934, the NFL did not have a set number of games for teams to play, instead setting a minimum. The league mandated a 12-game regular season for each team beginning in [[1935 NFL season|1935]], later shortening this to 11 games in [[1937 NFL season|1937]] and 10 games in [[1943 NFL season|1943]], mainly due to World War II. After the war ended, the number of games returned to 11 games in [[1946 NFL season|1946]] and to 12 in 1947. The NFL went to a 14-game schedule in [[1961 NFL season|1961]], which it retained until switching to the current 16-game schedule in [[1978 NFL season|1978]].<ref name="NFL Regular Season Games Played per Season">{{cite web|url=http://www.profootballhof.com/history/release.aspx?release_id=1348|title=NFL Regular Season Games Played per Season|publisher=[[Pro Football Hall of Fame]]|accessdate=February 13, 2013}}</ref> Proposals to increase the regular season to 18 games have been made, but have been rejected in labor negotiations with the [[National Football League Players Association]] (NFLPA).<ref name=meaningless/>

The NFL operated in a two-conference system from 1933 to [[1966 NFL season|1966]], where the champions of each conference would meet in the [[NFL Championship Game]]. If two teams tied for the conference lead, they would meet in a [[one-game playoff]] to determine the conference champion. In [[1967 NFL season|1967]], the NFL expanded from 15 teams to 16 teams. Instead of just evening out the conferences by adding the expansion [[New Orleans Saints]] to the seven-member Western Conference, the NFL realigned the conferences and split each into two four-team divisions. The four division champions would meet in the [[NFL playoffs]], a two-round playoff.<ref name="Lady Luck and the Lombardi legend">{{cite web|url=http://www.coldhardfootballfacts.com/content/lady-luck-and-the-lombardi-legend/4897/|title=Lady Luck and the Lombardi legend|date=October 12, 2005|publisher=Cold Hard Football Facts.

Effectively a [[third place playoff|third-place game]], pitting the two conference runners-up against each other, the league considers Playoff Bowls to have been [[exhibition game|exhibitions]] rather than playoff games. The league discontinued the Playoff Bowl in 1970 due to its perception as a game for losers.<ref name="This Day in Browns History – Jan. 7">{{cite web|last=King|first=Steve|title=This Day in Browns History – Jan. 7|url=http://www.clevelandbrowns.com/news/article-1/This-Day-in-Browns-History---Jan-7/2c6ca22c-ca60-442a-93bd-09cbe18976f7|publisher=NFL Enterprises, LLC|website=ClevelandBrowns.com|date=January 7, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130111082936/http://www.clevelandbrowns.com/news/article-1/This-Day-in-Browns-History---Jan-7/2c6ca22c-ca60-442a-93bd-09cbe18976f7|archive-date=January 11, 2013|access-date=December 31, 2018|dead-url=yes}}</ref>

Following the addition of the former AFL teams into the NFL in [[1970 NFL season|1970]], the NFL split into two conferences with three divisions each. The expanded league, now with twenty-six teams,<ref name="History: 1961–1970">{{cite web|title=History: 1961–1970|url=http://www.nfl.com/history/chronology/1961-1970|publisher=NFL Enterprises, LLC|website=NFL.com|accessdate=February 14, 2013}}</ref> would also feature an expanded eight-team playoff, the participants being the three division champions from each conference as well as one 'wild card' team (the team with the best win percentage) from each conference. In 1978, the league added a second wild card team from each conference, bringing the total number of playoff teams to ten, and a further two wild card teams were added in [[1990 NFL season|1990]] to bring the total to twelve. When the NFL expanded to 32 teams in [[2002 NFL season|2002]], the league realigned, changing the division structure from three divisions in each conference to four divisions in each conference. As each division champion gets a playoff bid, the number of wild card teams from each conference dropped from three to two.<ref name="History of the Wild Card">{{cite web|url=http://www.profootballhof.com/history/story.aspx?story_id=1940|title=History of the Wild Card|publisher=[[Pro Football Hall of Fame]]|accessdate=February 14, 2013}}</ref>

The NFL gave up the tax exempt status in 2015 following public criticism; in a letter to the club owners, Commissioner [[Roger Goodell]] labeled it a "distraction", saying "the effects of the tax exempt status of the league office have been mischaracterized repeatedly in recent years... Every dollar of income generated through television rights fees, licensing agreements, sponsorships, ticket sales, and other means is earned by the 32 clubs and is taxable there. This will remain the case even when the league office and Management Council file returns as taxable entities, and the change in filing status will make no material difference to our business." As a result, the league office might owe around US$10&nbsp;million in income taxes, but it is no longer required to disclose the salaries of its executive officers.<ref name="NFL no longer non-profit after giving up tax exempt status">{{cite web|last1=Myers|first1=Gary|title=NFL no longer non-profit after giving up tax exempt status|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/sports/football/nfl-no-longer-non-profit-giving-tax-exempt-status-article-1.2202484|website=[[New York Daily News]]|accessdate=June 25, 2015|date=April 18, 2015}}</ref>

The league has three defined officers: the commissioner, secretary, and treasurer. Each conference has one defined officer, the president, which is essentially an honorary position with few powers and mostly ceremonial duties (such as awarding the conference championship trophy).

The commissioner is elected by affirmative vote of two-thirds or 18 (whichever is greater) of the members of the league, while the president of each conference is elected by an affirmative vote of three-fourths or ten of the conference members.<ref name="NFL Bylaws, p. 26–27">NFL Bylaws, p. 26–27.</ref> The commissioner appoints the secretary and treasurer and has broad authority in disputes between clubs, players, coaches, and employees. He is the "principal [[executive officer]]"<ref name="NFL Bylaws, p. 28–35" /> of the NFL and also has authority in hiring league employees, negotiating television contracts, disciplining individuals that own part or all of an NFL team, clubs, or employed individuals of an NFL club if they have violated league bylaws or committed "conduct detrimental to the welfare of the League or professional football".<ref name="NFL Bylaws, p. 28–35" /> The commissioner can, in the event of misconduct by a party associated with the league, suspend individuals, hand down a fine of up to US$500,000, cancel contracts with the league, and award or strip teams of draft picks.<ref name="NFL Bylaws, p. 28–35" />

In extreme cases, the commissioner can offer recommendations to the NFL's Executive Committee up to and including the "cancellation or forfeiture"<ref name="NFL Bylaws, p. 28–35" /> of a club's franchise or any other action he deems necessary. The commissioner can also issue sanctions up to and including a lifetime ban from the league if an individual connected to the NFL has bet on games or failed to notify the league of conspiracies or plans to bet on or fix games.<ref name="NFL Bylaws, p. 28–35">NFL Bylaws, p. 28–35.</ref> The current Commissioner of the National Football League is Roger Goodell, who was elected in 2006 after [[Paul Tagliabue]], the previous commissioner, retired.<ref name="Owners Pick Goodell as NFL Commissioner">{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/08/08/AR2006080801043.html|title=Owners Pick Goodell as NFL Commissioner|last=Maske|first=Mark|date=August 9, 2006|work=[[The Washington Post]]|accessdate=February 2, 2013}}</ref>

According to economist Richard Wolff, the NFL redistributes its wealth to all NFL teams equally in contravention of the typical corporate structure. By redistributing profits to all teams the NFL is ensuring that one team will not dominate the league through excessive earnings.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.democracyatwork.info/eu_women_s_movement_economics|title=Economic Update: Women's Movement Economics|publisher=}}</ref>

Each NFL club is granted a franchise, the league's authorization for the team to operate in its home city. This franchise covers 'Home Territory' (the 75 miles surrounding the city limits, or, if the team is within 100 miles of another league city, half the distance between the two cities) and 'Home Marketing Area' (Home Territory plus the rest of the state the club operates in, as well as the area the team operates its training camp in for the duration of the camp). Each NFL member has the exclusive right to host professional football games inside its Home Territory and the exclusive right to advertise, promote, and host events in its Home Marketing Area. There are several exceptions to this rule, mostly relating to teams with close proximity to each other: the [[San Francisco 49ers]] and [[Oakland Raiders]] only have exclusive rights in their cities and share rights outside of it; and teams that operate in the same city (e.g. New York City and Los Angeles) or the same state (e.g. California, Florida, and [[Texas]]) share the rights to the city's Home Territory and the state's Home Marketing Area, respectively.<ref>{{cite web|title=Article IV–Territorial Rights|url=http://www.nfl.com/static/content/public/static/html/careers/pdf/co_.pdf#page=14|publisher=NFL Enterprises, LLC|work=Constitution and By-Laws of the National Football League|date=February 1, 1970|accessdate=December 31, 2018}}</ref>

The 32 teams are organized into eight geographic divisions of four teams each. These divisions are further organized into two conferences, the [[National Football Conference]] and the [[American Football Conference]]. The two-conference structure has its origins in a time when major American professional football was organized into two independent leagues, the National Football League and its younger rival, the [[American Football League]]. The leagues [[AFL–NFL merger|merged in the late 1960s]], adopting the older league's name and reorganizing slightly to ensure the same number of teams in both conferences.

==Season format==
The NFL season format consists of a four-week [[National Football League preseason|preseason]], a seventeen-week [[National Football League regular season|regular season]] (each team plays 16 games), and a twelve-team [[NFL Playoffs|single-elimination playoff]] culminating in the Super Bowl, the league's championship game.

Currently, the thirteen opponents each team faces over the 16-game regular season schedule are set using a pre-determined formula:<ref>{{cite web|title=2012 Opponents Determined|url=http://nfllabor.files.wordpress.com/2012/01/2012-opponents-determined.pdf|publisher=NFL|accessdate=January 23, 2012|date=January 2, 2012}}</ref> The league runs a seventeen-week, 256-game regular season.

NFL regular season matchups are determined according to a scheduling formula. Within a division, all four teams play fourteen out of their sixteen games against common opponents – two games (home and away) are played against the other three teams in the division, while one game is held against all the members of a division from the NFC and a division from the AFC as determined by a rotating cycle (three years for the conference the team is in, and four years in the conference they are not in). The other two games are intraconference games, determined by the standings of the previous year – for example, if a team finishes first in its division, it will play two other first-place teams in its conference, while a team that finishes last would play two other last-place teams in the conference.<ref name="Realignment for 2002">{{cite web|title=Realignment for 2002|url=http://www.nfl.com/standings/divisionrealignment|publisher=NFL Enterprises, LLC|website=NFL.com|accessdate=February 4, 2013}}</ref> In total, each team plays sixteen games and has one bye week, where they do not play any games.<ref name="Unusual bye format traces to lockout">{{cite web|url=http://profootballtalk.nbcsports.com/2011/11/08/unusual-bye-format-traces-to-lockout/|title=Unusual bye format traces to lockout|last=Florio|first=Mike|date=November 8, 2011|publisher=[[Pro Football Talk]]. [[NBC Sports]]|accessdate=February 4, 2013}}</ref>

Although a team's home and away opponents are known by the end of the previous year's regular season, the exact dates and times for NFL games are not determined until much later because the league has to account for, among other things, the Major League Baseball postseason and local events that could pose a scheduling conflict with NFL games. During the 2010 season, over 500,000 potential schedules were created by computers, 5,000 of which were considered "playable schedules" and were reviewed by the NFL's scheduling team. After arriving at what they felt was the best schedule out of the group, nearly 50 more potential schedules were developed to try and ensure that the chosen schedule would be the best possible one.<ref name="NFL schedule navigated World Series, other conflicts ">{{cite web|url=http://www.sportsbusinessdaily.com/Journal/Issues/2010/04/20100426/This-Weeks-News/NFL-Schedule-Navigated-World-Series-Other-Conflicts.aspx|title=NFL schedule navigated World Series, other conflicts |last=Ourand|first=John|date=April 26, 2010|publisher=[[Sports Business Daily]]|accessdate=February 4, 2013}}</ref>

{{Main|NFL playoffs|Pro Bowl|Super Bowl}}
[[File:NFL playoff tree.PNG|thumb|right|upright=1.35|The seeding bracket for the NFL playoffs]]
Following the conclusion of the regular season, the NFL Playoffs, a twelve-team single elimination tournament, is then held. Six teams are selected from each conference: the winners of each of the four divisions as well as two wild card teams (the two remaining teams with the best overall record). These teams are seeded according to overall record, with the division champions always ranking higher than either of the wild card teams.<ref name="Tie-breaking procedures">{{cite web|title=Tie-breaking procedures|url=http://www.nfl.com/standings/tiebreakingprocedures|publisher=NFL Enterprises, LLC|website=NFL.com|accessdate=February 4, 2013}}</ref> The top two teams (seeded one and two) from each conference are awarded a bye week, while the remaining four teams (seeded 3–6) from each conference compete in the first round of the playoffs, the Wild Card round, with the third seed competing against the sixth seed and the fourth seed competing against the fifth seed. The winners of the Wild Card round advance to the Divisional Round, which matches the lower seeded team against the first seed and the higher seeded team against the second seed. The winners of those games then compete in the Conference Championships, with the higher remaining seed hosting the lower remaining seed. The AFC and NFC champions then compete in the Super Bowl to determine the league champion.

The only other postseason event hosted by the NFL is the [[Pro Bowl]], the league's [[all-star game]]. Since 2009, the Pro Bowl has been held the week before the [[Super Bowl]]; in previous years, the game was held the week following the Super Bowl, but in an effort to boost ratings, the game was moved to the week before.<ref name="Pro Bowl set for Jan. 27 in Honolulu, week before Super Bowl">{{cite news|title=Pro Bowl set for Jan. 27 in Honolulu, week before Super Bowl|url=http://www.nfl.com/news/story/09000d5d8297274d/article/pro-bowl-set-for-jan-27-in-honolulu-week-before-super-bowl|publisher=NFL Enterprises, LLC|website=NFL.com|date=May 30, 2012|accessdate=February 4, 2013}}</ref> Because of this, players from the teams participating in the Super Bowl are exempt from participating in the game.

==Trophies and awards==
{{main|List of National Football League awards}}

===Team trophies===
{{Main|Vince Lombardi Trophy|Ed Thorp Memorial Trophy|Brunswick-Balke Collender Cup}}
The National Football League has used three different trophies to honor its champion over its existence. The first trophy, the [[Brunswick-Balke Collender Cup]], was donated to the NFL (then APFA) in 1920 by the [[Brunswick Corporation|Brunswick-Balke Collender Corporation]]. The trophy, the appearance of which is only known by its description as a "silver loving cup", was intended to be a traveling trophy and not to become permanent until a team had won at least three titles. The league awarded it to the Akron Pros, champions of the inaugural 1920 season; however, the trophy was discontinued and its current whereabouts are unknown.<ref name="Local history: Searching for lost trophy">{{cite web|url=http://www.ohio.com/news/searching-for-lost-trophy-1.204246|title=Local history: Searching for lost trophy|last=Price|first=Mark J.|date=April 25, 2011|work=[[Akron Beacon Journal]]|accessdate=February 5, 2013}}</ref>

A second trophy, the [[Ed Thorp Memorial Trophy]], was issued by the NFL from 1934 to 1969. The trophy's namesake, Ed Thorp, was a referee in the league and a friend to many early league owners; upon his death in 1934, the league created the trophy to honor him. In addition to the main trophy, which would be in the possession of the current league champion, the league issued a smaller replica trophy to each champion, who would maintain permanent control over it. The current location of the Ed Thorp Memorial Trophy, long thought to be lost,<ref name="Inside Redskins Park: The Other Championship Trophy">{{cite web|url=http://redskinsblog.wordpress.com/2008/07/28/inside-redskins-park-the-other-championship-trophy/|title=Inside Redskins Park: The Other Championship Trophy|last=Terl|first=Matt|date=July 28, 2008|publisher=Official Redskins Blog|accessdate=February 5, 2013}}</ref> is believed to be possessed by the [[Green Bay Packers Hall of Fame]].<ref>{{cite news|last=Christi|first=Cliff|title=The mystery of the Ed Thorp Memorial Trophy|url=http://www.packers.com/news-and-events/article-cliffs-notes/article-1/The-mystery-of-the-Ed-Thorp-Memorial-Trophy/69ec5eb4-a138-453f-84db-ec0ee40f1cb0|publisher=NFL Enterprises, LLC|website=Packers.com|date=January 28, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170128174924/https://www.packers.com/news-and-events/article-cliffs-notes/article-1/The-mystery-of-the-Ed-Thorp-Memorial-Trophy/69ec5eb4-a138-453f-84db-ec0ee40f1cb0|archive-date=January 28, 2017|access-date=December 31, 2018|dead-url=yes}}</ref>

The current trophy of the NFL is the [[Vince Lombardi Trophy]]. The Super Bowl trophy was officially renamed in 1970 after [[Vince Lombardi]], who as head coach led the Green Bay Packers to victories in the first two Super Bowls. Unlike the previous trophies, a new Vince Lombardi Trophy is issued to each year's champion, who maintains permanent control of it. Lombardi Trophies are made by [[Tiffany & Co.]] out of sterling silver and are worth anywhere from US$25,000 to US$300,000.<ref name="Football's super prize reaches icon status">{{cite news|url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/money/general/2002/01/31/sb-trophy.htm|title=Football's super prize reaches icon status|last=Horovitz|first=Bruce|date=January 30, 2002|work=[[USA Today]]|accessdate=February 5, 2013}}</ref> Additionally, each player on the winning team as well as coaches and personnel are awarded [[Super Bowl ring]]s to commemorate their victory. The winning team chooses the company that makes the rings; each ring design varies, with the NFL mandating certain ring specifications (which have a degree of room for deviation), in addition to requiring the Super Bowl logo be on at least one side of the ring.<ref name="45 Years of Super Bowl Rings">{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/rings|title=45 Years of Super Bowl Rings|publisher=[[ESPN.com]]|accessdate=February 5, 2013}}</ref> The losing team are also awarded rings, which must be no more than half as valuable as the winners' rings, but those are almost never worn.<ref name="Super Bowl from A to Z">{{cite web|url=http://espn.go.com/page2/s/neel/020129.html|title=Super Bowl from A to Z|last=Neel|first=Eric|publisher=[[ESPN.com]]|accessdate=June 8, 2013}}</ref>

{{See also|List of current National Football League broadcasters}}

In the United States, the National Football League has television contracts with four networks: [[CBS]], [[ESPN]], [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]], and [[NBC]]. Collectively, these contracts cover every regular season and postseason game. In general, CBS televises afternoon games in which the away team is an AFC team, and Fox carries afternoon games in which the away team belongs to the NFC. These afternoon games are not carried on all affiliates, as multiple games are being played at once; each network affiliate is assigned one game per time slot, according to a complicated set of rules.<ref name="The tradition continues: NFL to remain on broadcast TV">{{cite news|title=The tradition continues: NFL to remain on broadcast TV|url=http://www.nfl.com/news/story/09000d5d8250cb48/article/the-tradition-continues-nfl-to-remain-on-broadcast-tv|publisher=NFL Enterprises, LLC|website=NFL.com|date=December 14, 2011|accessdate=February 5, 2013}}</ref> Since 2011, the league has reserved the right to give Sunday games that, under the contract, would normally air on one network to the other network (known as "flexible scheduling").<ref name="Flexible schedule flexes Broncos-Vikings from CBS to FOX">{{cite web|url=http://profootballtalk.nbcsports.com/2011/12/01/flexible-schedule-flexes-broncos-vikings-from-cbs-to-fox/|title=Flexible schedule flexes Broncos-Vikings from CBS to FOX|last=Florio|first=Mike|date=December 1, 2011|publisher=[[Pro Football Talk]]. [[NBC Sports]]|accessdate=February 5, 2013}}</ref> The only way to legally watch a regionally televised game not being carried on the local network affiliates is to purchase [[NFL Sunday Ticket]], the league's [[out-of-market sports package]], which is only available to subscribers to the [[DirecTV]] satellite service. The league also provides [[NFL RedZone|RedZone]], an [[omnibus (broadcast)|omnibus telecast]] that cuts to the most relevant plays in each game, live as they happen.

In addition to the regional games, the league also has packages of telecasts, mostly in prime time, that are carried nationwide. NBC broadcasts the primetime ''[[NBC Sunday Night Football|Sunday Night Football]]'' package', which includes the Thursday [[NFL Kickoff game]] that starts the regular season and a primetime [[NFL on Thanksgiving Day|Thanksgiving Day game]]. ESPN carries all [[Monday Night Football]] games.<ref name="The tradition continues: NFL to remain on broadcast TV" /> The NFL's own network, [[NFL Network]], broadcasts a series titled ''[[Thursday Night Football]]'', which was originally exclusive to the network, but which in recent years has had several games [[simulcast]] on CBS (since 2014) and NBC (since 2016) (except the Thanksgiving and kickoff games, which remain exclusive to NBC).<ref name="Thursday Night Football Scores Big for the NFL">{{cite web|url=http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2012-11-29/thursday-night-football-scores-big-for-the-nfl|title=Thursday Night Football Scores Big for the NFL|last=Fixmer|first=Andy|date=November 29, 2012|work=[[Bloomberg Businessweek]]|accessdate=February 5, 2013}}</ref> For the 2017 season, the NFL Network will broadcast 18 regular season games under its ''Thursday Night Football'' brand, 16 Thursday-evening contests (10 of which are simulcast on either NBC or CBS) as well as one of the [[NFL International Series]] games on a Sunday morning and one of the 2017 Christmas afternoon games. In addition, 10 of the Thursday night games will be streamed live on [[Amazon Prime]]. In 2017, the NFL games occupied the top three rates for a 30-second advertisement: $699,602 for Sunday Night Football, $550,709 for Thursday Night Football (NBC), and $549,791 for Thursday Night Football (CBS).<ref>{{Cite news | first=Leo | last=Sun | title=NFL games still command high ad prices | url=https://www.pressreader.com/usa/usa-today-us-edition/20171031/281736974712786| newspaper=Florida Today | location=New York City| pages= 3B | date=October 31, 2017 | accessdate=October 31, 2017}}</ref>

Through the 2014 season, the NFL had a [[NFL on television#Blackout policies|blackout policy]] in which games were 'blacked out' on local television in the home team's area if the home stadium was not sold out. Clubs could elect to set this requirement at only 85%, but they would have to give more ticket revenue to the visiting team; teams could also request a specific exemption from the NFL for the game. The vast majority of NFL games were not blacked out; only 6% of games were blacked out during the [[2011 NFL season|2011 season]],<ref name="NFL eases local TV blackout restrictions for upcoming season">{{cite news|title=NFL eases local TV blackout restrictions for upcoming season|url=http://www.nfl.com/news/story/09000d5d82a406ee/article/nfl-eases-local-tv-blackout-restrictions-for-upcoming-season?module=HP11_headline_stack|publisher=NFL Enterprises, LLC|website=NFL.com|date=June 30, 2012|accessdate=February 6, 2013}}</ref> and only two games were blacked out in {{nfly|2013}} and none in {{nfly|2014}}.<ref name="Blackout suspended">{{cite news|url=http://espn.go.com/nfl/story/_/id/12545081/nfl-suspend-tv-blackout-policy-2015-owners-vote |title=NFL to suspend TV blackout policy |publisher=''ESPN.com'' |date=March 24, 2015 |accessdate=March 24, 2015}}</ref> The NFL announced in March 2015 that it would suspend its blackout policy for at least the [[2015 NFL season|2015 season]].<ref name="Blackout suspended"/> According to [[Nielsen Company|Nielsen]], the NFL regular season since 2012 was watched by at least 200 million individuals, accounting for 80% of all television households in the United States and 69% of all potential viewers in the United States.

In addition to radio networks run by each NFL team, select NFL games are broadcast nationally by [[NFL on Westwood One Sports|Westwood One]] (known as Dial Global for the 2012 season). These games are broadcast on over 500 networks, giving all NFL markets access to each primetime game. The NFL's deal with Westwood One was extended in 2012 and will run through 2017.<ref name="NFL and Dial Global Agree on New Multi-Year Extension">{{cite web|url=http://dialglobalsports.com/2012/09/nfl-and-dial-global-agree-on-new-multi-year-extension/|title=NFL and Dial Global Agree on New Multi-Year Extension|date=September 19, 2012|publisher=[[Dial Global]]|accessdate=February 6, 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130425085514/http://dialglobalsports.com/2012/09/nfl-and-dial-global-agree-on-new-multi-year-extension/|archivedate=April 25, 2013}}</ref>

Some broadcasting innovations have either been introduced or popularized during NFL telecasts. Among them, the [[Skycam]] camera system was used for the first time in a live telecast, at a 1984 preseason NFL game in San Diego between the [[San Diego Chargers|Chargers]] and [[San Francisco 49ers|49ers]], and televised by CBS.<ref>{{cite news | url=https://archive.org/stream/byte-magazine-1985-10/1985_10_BYTE_10-10_Simulating_Society#page/n121/mode/2up | title=Skycam: An Aerial Robotic Camera System | work=BYTE | date=October 1985 | accessdate=April 2, 2016 | author=Cone, Lawrence L. | pages=122}}</ref> Commentator [[John Madden]] famously used a [[telestrator]] during games between the early 1980s to the mid-2000s, boosting the device's popularity.<ref>Oaks, Chris.

==Draft==
{{Main|National Football League Draft}}

Each April (excluding 2014 when it took place in May), the NFL holds a draft of college players. The draft consists of seven rounds, with each of the 32 clubs getting one pick in each round.<ref name="What's the NFL draft all about? ">{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/other_sports/american_football/8014105.stm|title=What's the NFL draft all about? |last=Love|first=Tim|date=April 23, 2009|work=BBC Sport|accessdate=February 11, 2013}}</ref> The draft order for non-playoff teams is determined by regular-season record; among playoff teams, teams are first ranked by the furthest round of the playoffs they reached, and then are ranked by regular-season record. For example, any team that reached the divisional round will be given a higher pick than any team that reached the conference championships, but will be given a lower pick than any team that did not make the divisional round. The Super Bowl champion always drafts last, and the losing team from the Super Bowl always drafts next-to-last.<ref name="Complete order of first round of 2011 NFL Draft determined">{{cite news|title=Complete order of first round of 2011 NFL Draft determined|url=http://www.nfl.com/news/story/09000d5d81d6b708/article/complete-order-of-first-round-of-2011-nfl-draft-determined|publisher=NFL Enterprises, LLC|website=NFL.com|date=March 27, 2012|accessdate=February 11, 2013}}</ref> All potential draftees must be at least three years removed from high school in order to be eligible for the draft.<ref name="NFL draft rules a bad deal for Jadeveon Clowney">{{cite web|url=http://profootballtalk.nbcsports.com/2013/01/01/nfl-draft-rules-a-bad-deal-for-jadeveon-clowney/|title=NFL draft rules a bad deal for Jadeveon Clowney|last=Smith|first=Michael David|date=January 1, 2013|publisher=[[Pro Football Talk]].

The NFL operates several other drafts in addition to the NFL draft. The league holds a [[National Football League Draft#Supplemental Draft|supplemental draft]] annually. Clubs submit emails to the league stating the player they wish to select and the round they will do so, and the team with the highest bid wins the rights to that player. The exact order is determined by a lottery held before the draft, and a successful bid for a player will result in the team forfeiting the rights to its pick in the equivalent round of the next NFL draft.<ref name="Supplemental draft primer: Josh Gordon has NFL teams buzzing">{{cite news|last=Jeremiah|first=Daniel|title=Supplemental draft primer: Josh Gordon has NFL teams buzzing|url=http://www.nfl.com/news/story/09000d5d82a78591/article/supplemental-draft-primer-josh-gordon-has-nfl-teams-buzzing|publisher=NFL Enterprises, LLC|website=NFL.com|date=July 11, 2012|accessdate=February 11, 2013}}</ref> Players are only eligible for the supplemental draft after being granted a petition for special eligibility.<ref name="Terrelle Pryor remains in draft limbo">{{cite web|url=http://espn.go.com/nfl/story/_/id/6861571/terrelle-pryor-wants-state-case-eligibility-nfl-supplemental-draft|title=Terrelle Pryor remains in draft limbo|last=Schefter|first=Adam|date=August 15, 2011|publisher=[[ESPN.com]]|accessdate=February 11, 2013}}</ref> The league holds [[expansion draft]]s, the most recent happening in [[2002 NFL Expansion Draft|2002]] when the [[Houston Texans]] began play as an [[expansion team]].<ref name="Building Block">{{cite web|url=http://static.espn.go.com/nfl/expansion02/index.html|title=Building Block|date=February 12, 2002|publisher=[[ESPN.com]]|accessdate=February 11, 2013}}</ref> Other drafts held by the league include [[1950 AAFC Dispersal Draft|an allocation draft in 1950]] to allocate players from several teams that played in the dissolved All-America Football Conference<ref name="Allocation Draft">{{cite web|url=http://www.profootballresearchers.org/AAFC/Allocation_Draft.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120505011322/http://www.profootballresearchers.org/AAFC/Allocation_Draft.pdf|dead-url=yes|archive-date=May 5, 2012|title=Allocation Draft|publisher=[[Professional Football Researchers Association]]|accessdate=February 11, 2013}}</ref> and a [[1984 NFL Supplemental Draft of USFL and CFL Players|supplemental draft in 1984]] to give NFL teams the rights to players who had been eligible for the main draft but had not been drafted because they had signed contracts with the [[United States Football League]] or [[Canadian Football League]].<ref name="1984 Supplemental Draft">{{cite web|url=http://www.profootballhof.com/history/release.aspx?release_id=1456|title=1984 Supplemental Draft|publisher=[[Pro Football Hall of Fame]]|accessdate=February 11, 2013}}</ref>

Like the other [[Major professional sports leagues in the United States and Canada|major sports leagues in the United States]], the NFL maintains protocol for a [[disaster draft]]. In the event of a 'near disaster' (less than 15 players killed or disabled) that caused the club to lose a quarterback, they could draft one from a team with at least three quarterbacks. In the event of a 'disaster' (15 or more players killed or disabled) that results in a club's season being canceled, a restocking draft would be held. Neither of these protocols has ever had to be implemented.<ref name="God forbid it should ever be needed">{{cite web|url=http://espn.go.com/gen/s/2001/0328/1163463.html|title='God forbid it should ever be needed'|last=Drehs|first=Wayne|date=April 10, 2001|publisher=[[ESPN.com]]|accessdate=February 11, 2013}}</ref>

==Free agency==
[[Free agent]]s in the National Football League are divided into [[restricted free agent]]s, who have three accrued seasons and whose current contract has expired, and [[unrestricted free agent]]s, who have four or more accrued seasons and whose contract has expired. An accrued season is defined as "six or more regular-season games on a club's active/inactive, reserved/injured or reserve/physically unable to perform lists".<ref name="Questions and answers for 2012 free agency">{{cite news|title=Questions and answers for 2012 free agency|url=http://www.nfl.com/freeagency/story/09000d5d82787135/article/questions-and-answers-for-2012-free-agency|publisher=NFL Enterprises, LLC|website=NFL.com|date=March 11, 2012|accessdate=February 16, 2013}}</ref> Restricted free agents are allowed to negotiate with other clubs besides their former club, but the former club has the right to match any offer. If they choose not to, they are compensated with draft picks. Unrestricted free agents are free to sign with any club, and no compensation is owed if they sign with a different club.<ref name="Questions and answers for 2012 free agency" />

Clubs are given one [[franchise tag]] to offer to any unrestricted free agent. The franchise tag is a one-year deal that pays the player 120% of his previous contract or no less than the average of the five highest-paid players at his position, whichever is greater. There are two types of franchise tags: exclusive tags, which do not allow the player to negotiate with other clubs, and non-exclusive tags, which allow the player to negotiate with other clubs but gives his former club the right to match any offer and two first-round draft picks if they decline to match it.<ref name="NFL Explained: The Franchise Tag">{{cite web|url=http://www.nfluk.com/opinions/articles/nfl-explained-franchise-tag |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120218204906/http://www.nfluk.com/opinions/articles/nfl-explained-franchise-tag |dead-url=yes |archive-date=February 18, 2012 |title=NFL Explained: The Franchise Tag |last=Reynolds |first=Neil |date=February 16, 2012 |publisher=NFLUK |accessdate=February 16, 2013 |df= }}</ref>

Clubs also have the option to use a [[transition tag]], which is similar to the non-exclusive franchise tag but offers no compensation if the former club refuses to match the offer.<ref name="NFL Franchise Tags and the Miami Dolphins">{{cite web|last=Nogle|first=Kevin|title=NFL Franchise Tags and the Miami Dolphins|url=http://www.thephinsider.com/2012/12/28/3809610/nfl-franchise-tags-and-the-miami-dolphins|publisher=[[SB Nation]]|website=ThePhinsider.com|date=December 28, 2012|accessdate=February 16, 2013}}</ref> Due to that stipulation, the transition tag is rarely used,<ref name="New wrinkles to franchise tag, salary cap happened for reason">{{cite news|last=Breer|first=Albert|title=New wrinkles to franchise tag, salary cap happened for reason|url=http://www.nfl.com/news/story/09000d5d8272422b/article/new-wrinkles-to-franchise-tag-salary-cap-happened-for-reason|publisher=NFL Enterprises, LLC|website=NFL.com|date=February 23, 2012|accessdate=February 16, 2013}}</ref> even with the removal of the "poison pill" strategy (offering a contract with stipulations that the former club would be unable to match) that essentially ended the usage of the tag league-wide.<ref name="The Poison Pill is dead">{{cite web|url=http://12thmanrising.com/2012/02/16/the-poison-pill-is-dead/|title=The Poison Pill is dead|last=Myers|first=Keith|date=February 16, 2008|publisher=12th Man Rising.

Members of clubs' [[Practice squad#National Football League|practice squad]]s, despite being paid by and working for their respective clubs, are also simultaneously a kind of free agent and are able to sign to any other club's active roster (provided their new club is not their previous club's next opponent within a set number of days) without compensation to their previous club; practice squad players cannot be signed to other clubs' practice squads, however, unless released by their original club first.<ref>{{cite news|last=Chassen|first=Alexis|title=Everything you need to know about NFL practice squads|url=https://www.sbnation.com/nfl/2015/9/5/9168523/nfl-practice-squad-players-eligibility-salary|publisher=SB Nation|date=September 6, 2015|accessdate=January 16, 2017}}</ref>
