The world-renowned [[University of Cambridge]] was founded in 1209.<ref>{{cite news |url= https://www.telegraph.co.uk/education/universityeducation/8793862/What-it-takes-to-make-it-to-Oxbridge.html |title=What it takes to make it to Oxbridge |first=Richard |last=Cairns |newspaper=[[The Daily Telegraph]] |location =London |date=1 October 2011 |accessdate=26 February 2012}}</ref>  The buildings of the university include [[King's College Chapel, Cambridge|King's College Chapel]], [[Cavendish Laboratory]], and the [[Cambridge University Library]], one of the largest legal deposit libraries in the world.

[[Anglia Ruskin University]] evolved from the Cambridge School of Art and the Cambridgeshire College of Arts and Technology has its main campus in the city.

Cambridge is at the heart of the high-technology [[Silicon Fen]] with industries such as [[software industry|software]] and [[bioscience]] and many start-up companies born out of the university.

The principal [[Roman Britain|Roman]] site is a small fort (''{{lang|la|[[castrum]]}}'') '''[[Duroliponte]]''' on [[Castle Hill, Cambridge|Castle Hill]], just northwest of the city centre around the location of the earlier [[Britons (Celtic people)|British]] village. The fort was bounded on two sides by the lines formed by the present [[Mount Pleasant, Cambridge|Mount Pleasant]], continuing across [[Huntingdon Road]] into Clare Street. The eastern side followed Magrath Avenue, with the southern side running near to [[Chesterton Lane, Cambridge|Chesterton Lane]] and [[Kettle's Yard]] before turning northwest at Honey Hill.<ref>{{cite book | last=Gray |first=Ronald D |author2=Stubbings, Derek | title= Cambridge Street-Names: Their Origins and Associations |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] | date=2000 | location=Cambridge | pages=2–3}}</ref> It was constructed around AD&nbsp;70 and converted to civilian use around 50 years later.

===Early-industrial era===
In the 19th century, in common with many other English towns, Cambridge expanded rapidly, due in part to increased life expectancy and improved agricultural production leading to increased trade in town markets.<ref name="british-history-66609">{{cite web |url=http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=66609 |title=The city of Cambridge: Economic history |author=J.

During the Second World War, Cambridge was an important centre for defence of the east coast. The town became a military centre, with an [[R.A.F.]] training centre and the regional headquarters for Norfolk, Suffolk, Essex, Cambridgeshire, [[Huntingdonshire]], Hertfordshire, and [[Bedfordshire]] established during the conflict.<ref name="british-history-66605"/> The town itself escaped relatively lightly from German bombing raids, which were mainly targeted at the railway. 29 people were killed and no historic buildings were damaged.

Cambridge is a [[non-metropolitan district]] served by [[Cambridge City Council]]. Cambridge Local Authority District covers most of the City's urban area but some extends outside this into South Cambridgeshire District. Cambridge is one of five districts within the county of Cambridgeshire, and is bordered on all sides by the mainly rural [[South Cambridgeshire]] district. The city council's headquarters are in the [[Cambridge Guildhall|Guildhall]], a large building in the market square. Cambridge was granted a Royal Charter by King John in 1207, which permitted the appointment of a Mayor,<ref name="1207charter">{{cite web | url=https://www.cambridge.gov.uk/ceremonial-maces-chain-of-office-city-chest | title=Ceremonial maces, 1207 charter and the city's coat of arms | publisher=Cambridge City Council | accessdate=8 June 2015}}</ref> although the first recorded Mayor, Harvey FitzEustace, served in 1213.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cambridge.gov.uk/ccm/content/council-and-democracy/how-the-council-works/the-mayor/mayors-of-cambridge.en |title=The mayors of Cambridge |publisher=Cambridge City Council |accessdate=4 March 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090923003216/http://www.cambridge.gov.uk/ccm/content/council-and-democracy/how-the-council-works/the-mayor/mayors-of-cambridge.en |archivedate=23 September 2009 }}</ref> City councillors now elect a mayor annually.

For electoral purposes the city is divided into 14 wards: Abbey, [[Arbury]], Castle, [[Cherry Hinton]], Coleridge, [[Chesterton, Cambridge|East Chesterton]], [[King's Hedges]], Market, [[Newnham, Cambridgeshire|Newnham]], [[Mill Road, Cambridge|Petersfield]], Queen Edith's, [[Mill Road, Cambridge|Romsey]], [[Trumpington, Cambridgeshire|Trumpington]], and [[Chesterton, Cambridge|West Chesterton]]. The political composition of the city council is currently:  25 [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] councillors, 14 [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrat]], 2 independent  and one [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]].<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.cambridge-news.co.uk/News/Elections-2014-Labour-take-control-of-Cambridge-City-Council-20140523052655.htm | title=Elections 2014: Labour takes control of Cambridge City Council | work=Cambridge News | date=23 May 2014 | accessdate=24 May 2014 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140525145244/http://www.cambridge-news.co.uk/News/Elections-2014-Labour-take-control-of-Cambridge-City-Council-20140523052655.htm | archivedate=25 May 2014 | df=dmy-all }}</ref>

==Economy==

The town's river link to the surrounding agricultural land, and good road connections to London in the south meant Cambridge has historically served as an important regional trading post. King Henry I granted Cambridge a monopoly on river trade, privileging this area of the economy of Cambridge <ref>{{cite book|title=The Story of Cambridge|first=Stephanie|last=Boyd|work=Cambridge University Press |ISBN=978-0-521-62897-6|year=2005}}</ref> The town [[Market Hill, Cambridge|market]] provided for trade in a wide variety of goods and annual trading fairs such as [[Stourbridge Fair]] and [[Midsummer Fair]] were visited by merchants from across the country. The river was described in an account of 1748 as being "often so full of [merchant boats] that the navigation thereof is stopped for some time".<ref name="Gentleman1748">{{cite journal |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=CvoqAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA64 |journal=The London magazine, or, Gentleman's monthly intelligencer |page=64 |title=A description of Cambridge |date=January 1748 |volume=17 |author1=Kimber, Isaac |author2=Kimber, Edward |location =London |publisher=R. Baldwin |accessdate=29 February 2012}}</ref> For example, 2000 [[wikt:Special:Search/firkin|firkins]] of butter were brought up the river every Monday from the agricultural lands to the North East, particularity Norfolk, to be unloaded in the town for road transportation to London.<ref name="Gentleman1748"/> Changing patterns of retail distribution and the advent of the railways led to a decline in Cambridge's importance as a market town.<ref>{{cite book |title= A History of the University of Cambridge |volume=3 |first=Peter |last=Searby  |page=705 |isbn=978-0-521-35060-0 |year=1997 |publisher=Cambridge University Press}}</ref>

==Sport==

===Football===

[[File:Reality Checkpoint - geograph.org.uk - 971592.jpg|thumb|Parker's Piece]]
Cambridge played a unique role in the invention of modern [[association football|football]]: the game's first set of rules were drawn up by members of the University in 1848. The [[Cambridge Rules]] were first played on [[Parker's Piece]] and had a "defining influence on the 1863 [[The Football Association|Football Association]] rules." which again were first played on Parker's Piece.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.bbc.co.uk/cambridgeshire/content/articles/2006/06/09/cambridge_football_rules_parkers_piece_feature.shtml |title=Cambridge...the birthplace of football?! |publisher=BBC}}</ref>

The city is home to [[Cambridge United F.C.]], who play at the [[Abbey Stadium]]. Formed in 1912, as Abbey United, they were elected to the [[Football League]] in 1970 and reached the [[Football League Second Division]] in 1978, although a serious decline in them in the mid 1980s saw them drop back down to the [[Football League Fourth Division]] and almost go out of business. Success returned to the club in the early 1990s when they won two successive promotions and reached the [[FA Cup]] quarter finals in both of those seasons, and in 1992 they came close to becoming the first English team to win three successive Football League promotions which would have taken them into the newly created [[FA Premier League]]. But they were beaten in the playoffs and another decline set in, which was completed in 2005 when they were relegated from the Football League and for the second time in 20 years narrowly avoided going out of business. After nine years of non league football they returned to the Football League in 2014 by winning the [[Conference National]] playoffs.

[[Cambridge City F.C.]] of the [[Southern Football League Premier Division]] now play in the adjoining village of [[Histon and Impington|Histon]]. Formed in Cambridge in 1908 as Cambridge Town, the club were [[Southern Premier League]] champions in 1962-63, the highest they have finished in the [[English football pyramid]]. After a legal dispute with their landlords,<ref>{{cite web|url = https://www.theguardian.com/football/2007/oct/03/newsstory.sport2|title = The supporters who took on a property developer and won|date = 3 October 2007|accessdate = 3 September 2014|website = The Guardian|publisher = |last = Conn|first = David}}</ref> the club left their home ground in Cambridge in order to [[groundshare]] with fellow Southern League Premier club  [[Histon F.C.]] in 2013-14 and intend to construct a new ground outside the city, in [[Sawston]].
