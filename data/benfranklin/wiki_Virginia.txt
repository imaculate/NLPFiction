'''Virginia''' ({{IPAc-en|audio=en-us-Virginia.ogg|v|ər|ˈ|dʒ|ɪ|n|i|ə}}), officially the '''Commonwealth of Virginia''', is a state in the [[Southeastern United States|Southeastern]]<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nationalgeographic.org/maps/united-states-regions/|title=United States Regions|first=National Geographic|last=Society|date=January 3, 2012|publisher=}}</ref> and [[Mid-Atlantic (United States)|Mid-Atlantic]]<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bls.gov/regions/mid-atlantic/|title=Mid-Atlantic Home : Mid–Atlantic Information Office : U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics|website=www.bls.gov}}</ref> regions of the United States located between the [[East Coast of the United States|Atlantic Coast]] and the [[Appalachian Mountains]]. Virginia is nicknamed the "Old Dominion" due to its status as the first English colonial possession established in mainland North America<ref name=encolddominion>{{cite web|url=http://www.encyclopediavirginia.org/Old_Dominion|title=Old Dominion|publisher=Encyclopedia Virginia}}</ref> and "Mother of Presidents" because [[List of Presidents of the United States by home state#Birth places|eight U.S. presidents]] were born there, more than any other state. The geography and climate of the [[Commonwealth (U.S. state)|Commonwealth]] are shaped by the [[Blue Ridge Mountains]] and the [[Chesapeake Bay]], which provide habitat for much of its flora and fauna. The capital of the Commonwealth is [[Richmond, Virginia|Richmond]]; [[Virginia Beach, Virginia|Virginia Beach]] is the most populous city, and [[Fairfax County, Virginia|Fairfax County]] is the most populous political subdivision. The Commonwealth's estimated population {{as of|2017|lc=on}} is over 8.4 million.<ref name=PopHousingEst>{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/popest.html|title=Population and Housing Unit Estimates |date=June 22, 2017 |accessdate=June 22, 2017|publisher=[[U.S. Census Bureau]]}}</ref>

The area's history begins with [[Native American tribes in Virginia|several indigenous groups]], including the [[Powhatan]]. In 1607 the [[London Company]] established the [[Colony of Virginia]] as the first permanent [[New World]] [[Kingdom of England|English]] colony. Slave labor and the land acquired from displaced Native American tribes each played a significant role in the colony's early politics and plantation economy. Virginia was one of the [[Thirteen Colonies|13 Colonies]] in the [[American Revolution]]. In the [[American Civil War]], Virginia's [[Virginia Secession Convention of 1861|Secession Convention]] resolved to join the Confederacy, and Virginia's [[Wheeling Convention#First Wheeling Convention|First Wheeling Convention]] resolved to remain in the Union; that led to the creation of [[West Virginia]]. Although the Commonwealth was under [[Solid South|one-party rule]] for nearly a century following [[Reconstruction era of the United States|Reconstruction]], both major national parties are competitive in modern Virginia.<ref name=purple/>

The [[Virginia General Assembly]] is the oldest continuous law-making body in the New World.<ref>{{cite web|title=About the General Assembly|url=http://virginiageneralassembly.gov/virginiaLegislature.php?secid=20&activesec=2#!hb=1&mainContentTabs=4&content=4,includes/contentTemplate.php%3Ftid%3D52%26ctype%3Db%26cid%3D31|website=Website: Virginia General Assembly|publisher=State of Virginia|accessdate=June 5, 2013}}</ref> The state government was ranked most effective by the [[Pew Research Center|Pew Center on the States]] in both 2005 and 2008.<ref name=pew/> It is unique in how it treats cities and counties equally, manages local roads, and prohibits its governors from serving consecutive terms. Virginia's economy has many sectors: agriculture in the [[Shenandoah Valley]]; federal agencies in [[Northern Virginia]], including the headquarters of the [[United States Department of Defense|U.S. Department of Defense]] and [[Central Intelligence Agency]] (CIA); and military facilities in [[Hampton Roads]], the site of the [[Virginia Port Authority|region's main seaport]].

In colonial Virginia, free men elected the lower house of the legislature, called the [[House of Burgesses]], which together with the Governor's Council, made the "General Assembly". Founded in 1619, the [[Virginia General Assembly]] is still in existence as the oldest legislature in the Western Hemisphere.<ref name=burgesses>{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/05/06/AR2006050601099_pf.html|title=Latest Budget Standoff Met With Shrugs|first1=Rosalind S.|last1=Helderman|first2=Chris L.|last2=Jenkins|work=[[The Washington Post]]|date=May 7, 2006|accessdate=November 24, 2007}}</ref> In 2008, the government was ranked by the [[Pew Research Center|Pew Center on the States]] with an A− in terms of its efficiency, effectiveness, and infrastructure, tied with [[Utah]] and [[Washington (state)|Washington]].

Since 1971, the government has functioned under the seventh [[Constitution of Virginia]], which provides for a strong legislature and a unified judicial system. Similar to the [[federal government of the United States|federal structure]], the government is divided in [[Separation of powers|three branches]]: legislative, executive, and judicial. The legislature is the [[Virginia General Assembly|General Assembly]], a bicameral body whose 100-member [[Virginia House of Delegates|House of Delegates]] and 40-member [[Senate of Virginia|Senate]] write the laws for the Commonwealth. The Assembly is stronger than the executive, as it selects judges and justices. The Governor and [[Lieutenant Governor of Virginia|Lieutenant Governor]] are elected every four years in separate elections. Incumbent [[List of Virginia Governors|governors]] cannot run for re-election, however the Lieutenant Governor and [[Attorney General of Virginia|Attorney General]] can, and governors may serve non-consecutive terms.<ref name=constitution>{{cite journal|title=Commentaries on the Constitution of Virginia by A.

==State symbols==
{{Main|List of Virginia state symbols}}
[[File:Welcome_to_Virginia_Sign.jpg|thumb|The state slogan, "[[Virginia is for Lovers]]," was developed in 1968 and is featured on the state's welcome signs|alt=A large rectangular metal sign, mostly black, with the words "Welcome To Virginia" and "Virginia is for lovers" with a red heart symbol on the left.]]
The state nickname is its oldest symbol, though it has never been made official by law. Virginia was given the title "[[Dominion]]" by King [[Charles II of England]] at the time of [[The Restoration]], because it had remained loyal to the crown during the [[English Civil War]], and the present moniker, "Old Dominion" is a reference to that title. Charles' supporters were called [[Cavalier]]s, and "The Cavalier State" nickname was popularized after the [[American Civil War]] to romanticize the antebellum period. Sports teams from the [[University of Virginia]] are called the [[Virginia Cavaliers|Cavaliers]].{{sfn|Welch|2006|pp=1–3}} The other nickname, "Mother of Presidents", is also historic, as eight Virginians have served as [[Lists of United States Presidents by place of birth#By state of birth|President of the United States]], including four of the first five.<ref name=factpack/>

The state's motto, ''[[Sic semper tyrannis|Sic Semper Tyrannis]]'', translates from Latin as "Thus Always to Tyrants", and is used on the state seal, which is then used on the flag. While the seal was designed in 1776, and the flag was first used in the 1830s, both were made official in 1930.<ref name=factpack>{{cite web|url=http://legis.state.va.us/1_cap_class/class_media/4_5_pdfs/factpack-1.pdf |title=Factpack |publisher=[[Virginia General Assembly]] |date=January 11, 2007 |accessdate=October 14, 2008 |format=PDF |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081028193205/http://legis.state.va.us/1_cap_class/class_media/4_5_pdfs/factpack-1.pdf |archivedate=October 28, 2008 |df= }}</ref> The majority of the other symbols were made official in the late 20th century.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://legis.state.va.us/1_cap_class/9-12/9_12_emb_symb.html |title=Capitol Classroom |publisher=[[Virginia General Assembly]] |date=December 13, 2007 |accessdate=April 12, 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080511140513/https://legis.state.va.us/1_cap_class/9-12/9_12_emb_symb.html |archivedate=May 11, 2008 |df= }}</ref> The [[Virginia reel (dance)|Virginia reel]] is among the [[square dance]]s classified as the [[List of U.S. state dances|state dance]].<ref name=eov/> In March 2015, after 20 years without a [[List of U.S. state songs|state song]], Virginia received two: "[[Our Great Virginia]]" (official traditional state song) and "[[Sweet Virginia Breeze]]" (official popular state song).<ref>{{cite news|url=http://patch.com/virginia/fairfaxcity/listen-virginia-now-has-2-state-songs|title=Listen: Virginia Now Has 2 State Songs|work=Patch|date=March 27, 2015|accessdate=July 29, 2015}}</ref> In 1940, Virginia made "[[Carry Me Back to Old Virginny]]" the state song, but it was retired in 1997 and reclassified as the state song emeritus.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.roanoke.com/columnists/berrier/wb/146590|title=Carry me back to the state song search|work=[[The Roanoke Times]]|date=January 11, 2008|accessdate=September 10, 2009|first=Ralph|last=Berrier|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120910022435/http://www.roanoke.com/columnists/berrier/wb/146590|archivedate=September 10, 2012|df=mdy-all}}</ref>
