In cultures that practice marital [[monogamy]], '''bigamy''' is the act of entering into a marriage with one person while still legally married to another.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/bigamy|title=Definition of BIGAMY|author=|date=|website=www.merriam-webster.com|accessdate=28 April 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170928005809/https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/bigamy|archivedate=28 September 2017|df=}}</ref> Bigamy is a crime in most Western countries, and when it occurs in this context often neither the first nor second spouse is aware of the other.<ref name="MarriageCustoms">{{cite book |author=George Monger |title=Marriage customs of the world: from henna to honeymoons |publisher=ABC-CLIO |location=Santa Barbara, Calif |year=2004 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=o8JlWxBYs40C&pg=PA31 |page=31 |isbn=1-57607-987-2 |accessdate=2012-07-30}}</ref><ref name="LawLibraryBigamy">{{cite web |url=http://law.jrank.org/pages/2102/Sex-Offenses-Consensual-Bigamy.html |title=Sex Offenses: Consensual - Bigamy |work=Law Library - American Law and Legal Information |accessdate=2009-05-10 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091003122757/http://law.jrank.org/pages/2102/Sex-Offenses-Consensual-Bigamy.html |archivedate=2009-10-03 |df= }}</ref> In countries that have bigamy laws, consent from a prior spouse makes no difference to the legality of the second marriage, which is usually considered [[void marriage|void]].

==History of anti-bigamy laws==
Even before Christianity became the official religion of the [[Roman Empire]], [[Diocletian]] and [[Maximian]] passed strict anti-polygamy laws in 285&nbsp;AD that mandated monogamy as the only form of legal marital relationship, as had traditionally been the case in classical Greece and Rome.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}} In 393, the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] Emperor [[Theodosius I]] issued an imperial edict to extend the ban on polygamy to Jewish communities. In 1000, Rabbi [[Gershom ben Judah]] ruled polygamy inadmissible within [[Ashkenazi Jews|Ashkenazi]] Jewish communities living in a Christian environment.

According to feminist historian Sara McDougall, the Christian European insistence on monogamy and its enforcement arose as a consequence of 16th-century [[Islam]]ic incursions into Central Europe and the advent of [[European colonialism]] within the Americas, Africa, and Asia, which exposed European Christians to cultures that practised [[polygamy]]. As a consequence, nominal Christian male bigamists were subjected to unprecedented harsh punishments, such as [[Capital punishment|execution]], [[galley]] servitude, exile, and prolonged imprisonment. McDougall argues that female bigamists were not as harshly punished due to women's perceived absence of moral agency.<ref>Sara McDougall, ''Bigamy and Christian Identity in Late Medieval Champagne'', Philadelphia, Pennsylvania University Press, 2012</ref>{{Single Source-inline|why do an entire paragraph on one writer's opinion?

In ancient China, bigamy was a punishable offence; however, concubines and mistresses were tolerated as long as they were not acquired through an official marriage.  A man, at any given time, could only be married to one woman, and vice versa.  Issue with the wife enjoyed preference in inheritance and social status.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}

Most [[Western world|western]] countries do not recognize [[Polygamy|polygamous]] marriages, and consider bigamy a crime. Several countries also prohibit people from living a polygamous lifestyle.  This is the case in some states of the United States where the criminalization of a polygamous lifestyle originated as [[Anti-Mormonism|anti-Mormon]] laws, although they are rarely enforced.<ref>

In [[diplomatic law]], consular spouses from polygamous countries are sometimes exempt from a general prohibition on polygamy in host countries. In some such countries, only one spouse of a polygamous diplomat may be accredited, however.<ref>{{cite book |last= Shaw |first= Malcolm Nathan |title= International law |publisher= [[Cambridge University Press]] |year= 2003 |edition= 5th |pages= 684 |isbn= 0-521-82473-7 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=cc3XzkFt-IUC&pg=PA684#PPA684,M1 }}</ref>
