The '''American Philosophical Society''' ('''APS'''), founded in 1743 and located in [[Philadelphia]], is an eminent [[scholarly]] organization of international reputation that promotes useful knowledge in the sciences and humanities through excellence in scholarly research, professional meetings, publications, library resources, and community outreach. Considered the first learned society in the United States, it has played an important role in American cultural and intellectual life for over 270&nbsp;years.

Through research grants, published journals, the American Philosophical Society Museum, an extensive library, and regular meetings, the society continues to advance a variety of disciplines in the [[humanities]] and the sciences. [[Philosophical Hall]], now a museum, is located just east of [[Independence Hall]] in [[Independence National Historical Park]]; it was designated a [[National Historic Landmark]] in 1965.

==History==
The '''Philosophical Society''', as it was originally called, was founded in 1743 by [[Benjamin Franklin]], [[James Alexander (lawyer)]], [[Francis Hopkinson]], [[John Bartram]], [[Philip Syng|Philip Syng, Jr.]] and others<ref>Duer, William Alexander. [https://archive.org/stream/lifeofwilliamale00duerw#page/4/mode/2up ''The life of William Alexander, Earl of Stirling, Major-General in the Army of the United States during the Revolution''] New York: Wiley & Putnam for the New Jersey Historical Society, 1847. p.5</ref><ref>[http://www.philamuseum.org/collections/biography/14388.html "Philip Syng, Jr."], Philadelphia Museum of Art. Retrieved 31 December 2015.</ref> as an offshoot of an earlier club, the [[Junto (club)|Junto]]. It was founded two years after the [[University of Pennsylvania]], with which it remains closely tied.

Since its inception, the society attracted America's finest minds. Early members included [[George Washington]], [[John Adams]], [[Thomas Jefferson]],<ref name="AAA">{{cite web | author= | year=2011 | title=American Philosophical Society selected records, 1784–1954 | work= | publisher=[[Archives of American Art]] | url=http://www.aaa.si.edu/collections/american-philosophical-society-selected-records-10947 | accessdate=17 Jun 2011}}</ref> [[Alexander Hamilton]], [[James McHenry]], [[Thomas Paine]], [[David Rittenhouse]], [[Nicholas Biddle (banker)|Nicholas Biddle]], [[Owen Biddle, Sr.|Owen Biddle]], [[Benjamin Rush]], [[James Madison]], [[Michael Hillegas]], [[John Marshall]], and [[John Andrews (clergyman)|John Andrews]]. The society also recruited members from other countries, including [[Alexander von Humboldt]], the [[Marquis de Lafayette]], [[Baron von Steuben]], [[Tadeusz Kościuszko]], and [[Princess Dashkova]].

By 1746 the society had lapsed into inactivity. In 1767, however, it was revived, and on January 2, 1769, it united with the American Society for Promoting Useful Knowledge under the name '''American Philosophical Society Held at Philadelphia for Promoting Useful Knowledge'''. Benjamin Franklin was elected the first president.<ref>[[New International Encyclopedia]]</ref> During this time, the society maintained a standing Committee on American Improvements; one of its investigations was to study the prospects of a [[canal]] to connect the [[Chesapeake Bay]] and the [[Delaware River]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Goodrich|first=Carter|title=Government Promotion of American Canals and Railroads, 1800–1890|year=1974|publisher=Greenwood Press|isbn=978-0837177731}}</ref> The [[Chesapeake and Delaware Canal|canal]], which had been proposed by Thomas Gilpin,&nbsp;Sr., would not become reality until the 1820s.<ref>{{cite web|last=Kozel |first=Scott M. |title=Chesapeake and Delaware Canal (C & D Canal) |url=http://www.pennways.com/CD_Canal.html |work=PENNWAYS: Roads to the Future |publisher=Scott M.

After the [[American Revolution]], the society looked for [[leadership]] to [[Francis Hopkinson]], one of the signatories of the [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]].  Under his influence, the society received land from the government of [[Pennsylvania]], along with a plot of land in [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania|Philadelphia]] where Philosophical Hall now stands.

Illustrious names have continually been added to the membership roster, reflecting the society's scope. [[Charles Darwin]], [[Robert Frost]], [[Louis Pasteur]], [[Elizabeth Cabot Agassiz]], [[John James Audubon]], [[Linus Pauling]], [[Margaret Mead]], [[Maria Mitchell]], and [[Thomas Edison]] became members of the society. The society continues to attract names of high renown today, with a current membership list (as of the April 2005 elections) of 920&nbsp;members, including 772&nbsp;resident members (citizens or residents of the United States) and 148&nbsp;foreign members representing more than two dozen countries.

Many members of the [[Society of the Cincinnati]] were among the APS's first board members and contributors; today the APS and SOC still maintain an informal, collegial relationship.

==Awards==
In 1786, the society established the [[Magellanic Premium]], a prize for achievement in "navigation, [[astronomy]], or natural philosophy," the oldest scientific prize awarded by an American institution, which it still awards.  Other awards include the Barzun Prize for [[cultural history]], Judson Daland Prize for Outstanding Achievement in Clinical Investigation, the [[Benjamin Franklin Medal (American Philosophical Society)|Benjamin Franklin Medal]], the [[Lashley Award]] for [[neurobiology]], the Lewis Award, and the Thomas Jefferson Medal for distinguished achievement in the arts, humanities, or social sciences.

==Publications==
The APS has published the ''Transactions of the American Philosophical Society'' since 1771. Currently five issues appear each year.  The ''[[Proceedings of the American Philosophical Society|Proceedings]]'' have appeared since 1838: they publish the papers delivered at the biannual meetings of the society.  The society has also published the collected papers of [[Benjamin Franklin]], [[Joseph Henry]], [[William Penn]], and [[Meriwether Lewis]] and [[William Clark]]. [[Jane Aitken]] bound some 400 volumes for the society.{{sfn|James|1971|p=26}}

[[Philosophical Hall]], located in [[Philadelphia]], [[Pennsylvania]], at 104 South Fifth Street, between [[Chestnut Street (Philadelphia)|Chestnut]] and [[Walnut Street (Philadelphia)|Walnut]] Streets, immediately south of [[Old City Hall (Philadelphia)|Old City Hall]], was built in 1785–89 to house the society and was designed by Samuel Vaughan in the [[Federal architecture|Federal style]].<ref>{{cite philarch}} p.160</ref><ref name=philarchmit>{{cite philarchmit}}, p. 30</ref> A third floor was added in 1890, to accommodate the expanding library, but was removed in 1948–50<ref name=philarchmit /> when the building was restored to its original appearance for the creation of [[Independence National Historical Park]].<ref>Richard Webster, ''Philadelphia Preserved'' (Philadelphia: Temple University Press, 1976), p. 92.</ref> In 2001, it was opened to the public as The American Philosophical Society Museum, hosting revolving, thematic exhibitions that explore the intersections of history, art, and science. The museum features works of art, scientific instruments, original manuscripts, rare books, natural history specimens, and curiosities of all kinds from the APS's own collections, along with objects on loan from other institutions.<ref>{{Cite journal|title=American Philosophical Society Museum: About |publisher=ARTINFO |year=2008 |url=http://www.artinfo.com/galleryguide/22252/8770/about/american-philosophical-society-philadelphia/ |accessdate=2008-07-25 |postscript=<!--None--> }}{{dead link|date=October 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>

===Library Hall===
In 1789–90, the [[Library Company of Philadelphia]] (LCP) built its headquarters directly across 5th Street from APS. LCP sold its building in 1884, which was demolished for the expansion of the Drexel & Company Building in 1887. This building itself was demolished in the mid-1950s, during the creation of Independence National Historical Park.

APS built a library on the site in 1958, and recreated the facade of the old LCP building.

===Benjamin Franklin Hall===
APS restored the former Farmers' & Mechanics' Bank building at 425–29 Chestnut Street, which was built in 1854–5 to the design of John M. Gries in the [[Italianate architecture|Italianate style]],<ref>{{cite philarch}}, pp. 55–56</ref> to serve as a lecture hall. It is the site of meetings and most major events hosted or produced by the society.<ref name=apsdir>[http://www.amphilsoc.org/about/directions "Directions"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130604120817/http://www.amphilsoc.org/about/directions |date=2013-06-04 }} on the APS website</ref>

===Richardson Hall===
[[Constance Coleman Richardson|Constance C.]] and Edgar P. Richardson Hall at 431 Chestnut Street, immediately west of Benjamin Franklin Hall, is the former Pennsylvania Company for Insurances on Lives and Granting Annuities Building, which was built in 1871–73 and was designed by [[Addison Hutton]].<ref>{{cite philarch}}, p.64</ref>  It now contains offices and the Consortium for History of Science, Technology and Medicine.<ref name=apsdir />
