'''Yale University''' is an American [[Private university|private]] [[Ivy League]] [[Doctoral university|research university]] in [[New Haven, Connecticut]]. Founded in 1701, it is the [[List of Colonial Colleges|third-oldest institution]] of [[higher education]] in the [[United States]] and one of the nine [[Colonial Colleges]] chartered before the [[American Revolution]].<ref name=age>{{cite book |last1= Berkin|first1= Carol|last2= Miller|first2= Christopher |last3= Cherny |first3= Robert |last4= Gormly|first4=James |last5= Egerton|first5= Douglas|year=2012|title= Making America: A History of the United States, Brief |url= |edition= 6th|location= |publisher= Wadsworth |publication-date= |page= 79|doi= |doi-broken-date= |isbn=9781133317692}}</ref>

Chartered by [[Connecticut Colony]], the "Collegiate School" was established by clergy to educate [[Congregationalism in the United States|Congregational]] ministers. It moved to New Haven in 1716 and shortly after was renamed [[Yale College]] in recognition of a gift from [[British East India Company]] governor [[Elihu Yale]]. Originally restricted to theology and [[sacred language]]s, the curriculum began to incorporate humanities and sciences by the time of the [[American Revolution]]. In the 19th century, the college expanded into graduate and professional instruction, awarding the first [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] in the United States in 1861 and organizing as a university in 1887.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.yale.edu/schools/index.html |title=Academic programs &#124; Yale |publisher=Yale.edu |accessdate=September 16, 2009}}</ref> Its faculty and student populations grew after 1890 with rapid expansion of the physical campus and scientific research.

Yale is organized into fourteen constituent schools: the original [[Yale College|undergraduate college]], the [[Yale Graduate School of Arts and Sciences]] and twelve professional schools. While the university is governed by the [[Yale Corporation]], each school's [[faculty (division)|faculty]] oversees its curriculum and degree programs. In addition to a central campus in [[downtown New Haven]], the University owns athletic facilities in western New Haven, a campus in [[West Haven, Connecticut]] and forest and nature preserves throughout [[New England]]. The university's assets include an [[Yale University endowment|endowment]] valued at $29.4 billion as of October 2018, the second largest endowment of any educational institution in the world.<ref name="Endowment" /> The [[Yale University Library]], serving all constituent schools, holds more than 15 million volumes and is the third-largest academic library in the United States.<ref name="2013LibraryReport">{{cite report |last=Gibbons |first=Susan |title=Yale University Library Annual Report 2012–2013 |year=2013 |publisher=Yale University Library |url=http://elischolar.library.yale.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1006&context=yul_annual-reports#page=2 |accessdate=July 1, 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |publisher=American Library Association |title=ALA Library Fact Sheet 22 – The Nation's Largest Libraries: A Listing by Volumes Held |date=July 2010 |url=http://www.ala.org/ala/professionalresources/libfactsheets/alalibraryfactsheet22.cfm |accessdate=July 15, 2014}}</ref>

===Early history of Yale College===

====Origins====
[[File:Yale seal.png|upright=0.75|thumb|Official seal used by the College and the University]]
Yale traces its beginnings to "An Act for Liberty to Erect a Collegiate School", passed by the General Court of the [[Connecticut Colony|Colony of Connecticut]] on October 9, 1701, while meeting in New Haven. The Act was an effort to create an institution to train ministers and lay leadership for Connecticut. Soon thereafter, a group of ten [[Congregationalism in the United States|Congregational]] ministers, [[Samuel Andrew]], Thomas Buckingham, Israel Chauncy, Samuel Mather (brother of [[Increase Mather]]), Rev. James Noyes II (son of [[James Noyes]]), [[James Pierpont (Yale founder)|James Pierpont]], [[Abraham Pierson]], [[Noadiah Russell (Yale founder)|Noadiah Russell]], [[Joseph Webb]], and [[Timothy Woodbridge]], all [[alumni]] of [[Harvard]], met in the study of Reverend [[Samuel Russell (Yale co-founder)|Samuel Russell]] in [[Branford, Connecticut]], to pool their books to form the school's library.<ref>''[[The Harvard Crimson]]'': [http://www.thecrimson.com/article.aspx?ref=97832 "I'm Gonna Git Yoy Sukka: Classic Stories of Revenge at Harvard."]. Retrieved April 10, 2007.</ref> The group, led by [[James Pierpont (Yale founder)|James Pierpont]], is now known as "The Founders".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.library.yale.edu/mssa/YHO/Piersons/beginnings.html|title=Yale: A Short History - The Beginnings|website=www.library.yale.edu|access-date=June 16, 2016}}</ref>

Originally known as the "Collegiate School", the institution opened in the home of its first [[Rector (academia)|rector]], [[Abraham Pierson]], today considered the first president of Yale. Pierson lived in Killingworth (now [[Clinton, Connecticut|Clinton]]). The school moved to [[Old Saybrook, Connecticut|Saybrook]] and then [[Wethersfield, Connecticut|Wethersfield]]. In 1716, it moved to New Haven, Connecticut.

Meanwhile, there was a rift forming at Harvard between its sixth president, [[Increase Mather]], and the rest of the Harvard clergy, whom Mather viewed as increasingly liberal, ecclesiastically lax, and overly broad in [[Ecclesiastical polity|Church polity]]. The feud caused the Mathers to champion the success of the Collegiate School in the hope that it would maintain the [[Puritan]] religious orthodoxy in a way that Harvard had not.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://college.hmco.com/history/readerscomp/rcah/html/ah_057300_matherincrea.htm |title=Increase Mather}}, ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica Eleventh Edition]]'', [[Encyclopædia Britannica]]</ref>

====Naming and development====
In 1718, at the behest of either Rector [[Samuel Andrew]] or the colony's Governor [[Gurdon Saltonstall]], [[Cotton Mather]] contacted the successful Boston born businessman [[Elihu Yale]] to ask him for financial help in constructing a new building for the college. Through the persuasion of [[Jeremiah Dummer]], Yale, who had made a fortune through trade while living in Madras as a representative of the [[East India Company]], donated nine bales of goods, which were sold for more than £560, a substantial sum at the time. Cotton Mather suggested that the school change its name to "Yale College". (The name Yale is the [[English language|Anglicised]] spelling of the [[Welsh language|Welsh]] toponym, [[Iâl]]. from the family estate at Plas yn Iâl near the village of [[Llandegla]], [[Denbighshire]], [[Wales]]).<ref name=URE>Henry Davidson Love [https://books.google.com/books?id=yERBRASUKkoC&pg=PA490&dq=Elihu+Yale&hl=en&ei=7OVhTO2ZJoqQjAeHntyJCQ&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=5&ved=0CDsQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&q=Elihu%20Yale&f=false Indian Records Series Vestiges of Old Chennai 1640-1800] Mittal Publications</ref>

Meanwhile, a Harvard graduate working in England convinced some 180 prominent intellectuals that they should donate books to Yale. The 1714 shipment of 500 books represented the best of modern English literature, science, philosophy and theology.<ref>{{cite book |last=Oviatt |first=Edwin |title=The Beginnings of Yale (1701–1726)|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JKJLAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA298|year=1916|publisher=Yale UP|pages=298–302}}</ref> It had a profound effect on intellectuals at Yale. Undergraduate [[Jonathan Edwards (theologian)|Jonathan Edwards]] discovered John Locke's works and developed his original theology known as the "new divinity". In 1722 the Rector and six of his friends, who had a study group to discuss the new ideas, announced that they had given up Calvinism, become Arminians and joined the Church of England. They were ordained in England and returned to the colonies as missionaries for the Anglican faith. [[Thomas Clapp]] became president in 1745 and struggled to return the college to Calvinist orthodoxy, but he did not close the library. Other students found Deist books in the library.<ref>Edmund S. Morgan, ''American Heroes: Profiles of Men and Women Who Shaped Early America'' (2010) pp 26–32</ref>

====Curriculum====
Yale was swept up by the great intellectual movements of the period—the [[Great Awakening]] and the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]]—due to the religious and scientific interests of presidents [[Thomas Clap]] and [[Ezra Stiles]]. They were both instrumental in developing the scientific curriculum at Yale, while dealing with wars, student tumults, graffiti, "irrelevance" of curricula, desperate need for endowment and fights with the [[Connecticut General Assembly|Connecticut legislature]].<ref>Louis Leonard Tucker, ''Puritan Protagonist: President Thomas Clap of Yale College'' (1970); Edmund S. Morgan, ''The Gentle Puritan: A Life of Ezra Stiles, 1727–1795'' (1970).</ref>

Serious American students of theology and divinity, particularly in New England, regarded [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] as a [[classical language]], along with Greek and [[Latin]], and essential for study of the [[Old Testament]] in the original words. The Reverend [[Ezra Stiles]], president of the College from 1778 to 1795, brought with him his interest in the Hebrew language as a vehicle for studying ancient [[Bible|Biblical texts]] in their original language (as was common in other schools), requiring all freshmen to study Hebrew (in contrast to Harvard, where only upperclassmen were required to study the language) and is responsible for the Hebrew phrase אורים ותמים ([[Urim and Thummim]]) on the Yale seal. A 1746 graduate of Yale, Stiles came to the college with experience in education, having played an integral role in the founding of [[Brown University]] in addition to having been a minister.<ref>Edmund S Morgan, ''The Gentle Puritan: A Life of Ezra Stiles, 1727–1795'' (New York: W. W. Norton & Company, 1962), 205.</ref> Stiles' greatest challenge occurred in July 1779 when hostile British forces occupied New Haven and threatened to raze the College. However, Yale graduate [[Edmund Fanning (colonial administrator)|Edmund Fanning]], Secretary to the British General in command of the occupation, interceded and the College was saved. In 1803, Fanning was granted an honorary degree [[LL.D.]] for his efforts.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://freepages.genealogy.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~jwickham/edmund.htm|title=Edmund Fanning (1739–1818)|accessdate=June 30, 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101124120923/http://freepages.genealogy.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~jwickham/edmund.htm|archive-date=November 24, 2010|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}</ref>

====Students====
As the only college in Connecticut, Yale educated the sons of the elite.<ref>Historian Bruce Daniels has used biographical dictionaries of the college graduates of Yale University, presents statistics on Yale graduates from the classes of 1702 to 1780, focusing on the graduates' career choices, their success in life, religious affiliation, vital statistics, the percentage of those who supported the American Revolution, and geographic mobility. See Bruce C. Daniels, "College Students and Puritan Society: a Quantitative Profile of Yale Graduates in Colonial America," ''Connecticut History'' 1982 (23): 1–23</ref> Offenses for which students were punished included [[cardplaying]], [[tavern]]-going, destruction of college property, and acts of disobedience to college authorities. During the period, Harvard was distinctive for the stability and maturity of its tutor corps, while Yale had youth and zeal on its side.<ref>Kathryn McDaniel. Moore, "The War with the Tutors: Student-faculty Conflict at Harvard and Yale, 1745–1771," ''History of Education Quarterly'' 1978 18(2): 115–127,</ref>

The emphasis on classics gave rise to a number of private student societies, open only by invitation, which arose primarily as forums for discussions of modern scholarship, literature and politics. The first such organizations were debating societies: [[Crotonia (literary society)|Crotonia]] in 1738, [[Linonia]] in 1753 and [[Brothers in Unity]] in 1768.<ref>None of these continue to exist today. They are commemorated in names given to campus structures, such as Brothers in Unity Courtyard in Branford College.</ref>

===19th century===
[[File:Woolsey Hall Memorial Hall University Dining Hall Yale University.jpg|thumb|''[[Woolsey Hall]]'' in c. 1905]]The Yale Report of 1828 was a dogmatic defense of the Latin and Greek curriculum against critics who wanted more courses in modern languages, mathematics, and science. Unlike [[higher education in Europe]], there was no [[national curriculum]] for colleges and universities in the United States. In the competition for students and financial support, college leaders strove to keep current with demands for innovation. At the same time, they realized that a significant portion of their students and prospective students demanded a classical background. The Yale report meant the classics would not be abandoned. All institutions experimented with changes in the curriculum, often resulting in a dual-track. In the decentralized environment of higher education in the United States, balancing change with tradition was a common challenge because no one could afford to be completely modern or completely classical.<ref>Michael S. Pak, "The Yale Report of 1828: A New Reading and New Implications," ''History of Education Quarterly'' 2008 48(1): 30–57; Melvin I. Urofsky, "Reforms and Response: The Yale Report of 1828," ''History of Education Quarterly'', Vol. 5, No. 1 (Mar. 1965), pp. 53–67 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/366937 in JSTOR]</ref> A group of professors at Yale and New Haven Congregationalist ministers articulated a conservative response to the changes brought about by the [[Victorian culture]]. They concentrated on developing a whole man possessed of religious values sufficiently strong to resist temptations from within, yet flexible enough to adjust to the '[[-ism|ism]]s' ([[professionalism]], [[materialism]], [[individualism]], and [[consumerism]]) tempting him from without.<ref>Louise L. Stevenson, ''Scholarly Means to Evangelical Ends: The New Haven Scholars and the Transformation of Higher Learning in America, 1830–1890'' (1986)</ref> [[William Graham Sumner]], professor from 1872 to 1909, taught in the emerging disciplines of economics and sociology to overflowing classrooms. He bested President [[Noah Porter]], who disliked social science and wanted Yale to lock into its traditions of classical education. Porter objected to Sumner's use of a textbook by [[Herbert Spencer]] that espoused agnostic materialism because it might harm students.<ref>Alfred McClung Lee, "The Forgotten Sumner," ''Journal of the History of Sociology'' 1980–1981 3(1): 87–106</ref>

Until 1887, the legal name of the university was "The President and Fellows of Yale College, in New Haven". In 1887, under an act passed by the [[Connecticut General Assembly]], Yale gained its current, and shorter, name of "Yale University".<ref>{{cite web|title=The Yale Corporation: Charter and Legislation|url=http://www.yale.edu/about/University-Charter.pdf|website=Yale University |accessdate=July 18, 2014}}</ref>

====Sports and debate====
The Revolutionary War soldier [[Nathan Hale]] (Yale 1773) was the prototype of the Yale ideal in the early 19th&nbsp;century: a manly yet aristocratic scholar, equally well-versed in knowledge and sports, and a patriot who "regretted" that he "had but one life to lose" for his country. Western painter [[Frederic Remington]] (Yale 1900) was an artist whose heroes gloried in combat and tests of strength in the Wild West. The fictional, turn-of-the-20th-century Yale man Frank Merriwell embodied the heroic ideal without racial prejudice, and his fictional successor Frank Stover in the novel ''Stover at Yale'' (1911) questioned the business mentality that had become prevalent at the school. Increasingly the students turned to athletic stars as their heroes, especially since winning the big game became the goal of the student body, and the alumni, as well as the team itself.<ref>Robert Higgs, "'Götterdämmerung' and Palingenesis: Yale and the Heroic Ideal, 1865–1914," ''Proteus'' 1986 3(1): 18–24</ref>
[[File:Yale's four-oared crew team with 1876 Centennial Regatta trophy.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Yale's four-oared [[Rowing (sport)|crew]] team, posing with 1876 Centennial [[Regatta]] trophy, won at [[Philadelphia]]]]

Along with [[Harvard]] and [[Princeton University|Princeton]], Yale students rejected elite British concepts about 'amateurism' in sports and constructed athletic programs that were uniquely American, such as football.<ref>Ronald A. Smith, ''Sports and Freedom: The Rise of Big Time College Athletics'' (1988)</ref> The [[Harvard–Yale football rivalry]] began in 1875. Between 1892, when Harvard and Yale met in one of the first [[intercollegiate debates]]<ref>{{Cite book|title = Contest(ed) Writing: Re-Conceptualizing Literacy Competitions|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=77kwBwAAQBAJ|publisher = Cambridge Scholars Publishing|date = January 14, 2013|isbn = 9781443845472|first = Mary|last = Lamb}}</ref> and 1909 (the year of the first Triangular Debate of Harvard, Yale and Princeton) the rhetoric, symbolism, and metaphors used in athletics were used to frame these early debates. Debates were covered on front pages of [[college newspaper]]s and emphasized in [[yearbook]]s, and team members even received the equivalent of [[athletic letters]] for their jackets. There even were rallies sending off the debating teams to matches, but the debates never attained the broad appeal that athletics enjoyed. One reason may be that debates do not have a clear winner, as is the case in sports, and that scoring is subjective. In addition, with late 19th-century concerns about the impact of modern life on the human body, athletics offered hope that neither the individual nor the society was coming apart.<ref>Roberta J. Park, "Muscle, Mind, and 'Agon:' Intercollegiate Debating and Athletics at Harvard and Yale, 1892–1909," ''Journal of Sport History'' 1987 14(3): 263–285</ref>

In 1909–10, football faced a crisis resulting from the failure of the previous reforms of 1905–06 to solve the problem of serious injuries. There was a mood of alarm and mistrust, and, while the crisis was developing, the presidents of Harvard, Yale, and Princeton developed a project to reform the sport and forestall possible radical changes forced by government upon the sport. President [[Arthur Hadley]] of Yale, A. [[Lawrence Lowell]] of Harvard, and [[Woodrow Wilson]] of Princeton worked to develop moderate changes to reduce injuries. Their attempts, however, were reduced by rebellion against the rules committee and formation of the [[Intercollegiate Athletic Association]]. The big three had tried to operate independently of the majority, but changes did reduce injuries.<ref>John S., Watterson III, "The Football Crisis of 1909–1910: the Response of the Eastern 'Big Three'," ''Journal of Sport History'' 1981 8(1): 33–49</ref>

====Expansion====
[[File:View of Connecticut Hall Old Campus Yale College New Haven Connecticut.jpg|thumb|Connecticut Hall, oldest building on the Yale campus, built between 1750 and 1753]]

Yale expanded gradually, establishing the [[Yale School of Medicine]] (1810), [[Yale Divinity School]] (1822), [[Yale Law School]] (1843), [[Yale Graduate School of Arts and Sciences]] (1847), the [[Sheffield Scientific School]] (1847),<ref name="ReferenceB">Sheffield was originally named Yale Scientific School; it was renamed in 1861 after a major donation from [[Joseph E. Sheffield]].</ref> and the [[Yale School of Art|Yale School of Fine Arts]] (1869). In 1887, as the college continued to grow under the presidency of [[Timothy Dwight&nbsp;V]], Yale College was renamed Yale University, with the name [[Yale College]] subsequently applied to the undergraduate college. The university would later add the [[Yale School of Music]] (1894), the [[Yale School of Forestry & Environmental Studies]] (founded by Gifford Pinchot in 1900), the [[Yale School of Public Health]] (1915), the [[Yale School of Nursing]] (1923), the [[Yale School of Drama]](1955), the [[Yale Physician Associate Program]] (1973) and the [[Yale School of Management]] (1976). It would also reorganize its relationship with the Sheffield Scientific School.

Expansion caused controversy about Yale's new roles. [[Noah Porter]], moral philosopher, was president from 1871 to 1886. During an age of tremendous expansion in higher education, Porter resisted the rise of the new research university, claiming that an eager embrace of its ideals would corrupt undergraduate education. Many of Porter's contemporaries criticized his administration, and historians since have disparaged his leadership. Levesque argues Porter was not a simple-minded reactionary, uncritically committed to tradition, but a principled and selective conservative.<ref>George Levesque, "Noah Porter Revisited," ''Perspectives on the History of Higher Education'' 2007 26: 29–66,</ref> He did not endorse everything old or reject everything new; rather, he sought to apply long-established ethical and pedagogical principles to a rapidly changing culture. He may have misunderstood some of the challenges of his time, but he correctly anticipated the enduring tensions that have accompanied the emergence and growth of the modern university.

===20th century===

====Behavioral sciences====
Between 1925 and 1940, [[Foundation (non-profit)|philanthropic foundation]]s, especially ones connected with the [[Rockefeller family|Rockefellers]], contributed about $7&nbsp;million to support the Yale Institute of Human Relations and the affiliated Yerkes Laboratories of Primate [[Biology]]. The money went toward behavioral science research, which was supported by foundation officers who aimed to "improve mankind" under an informal, loosely defined human engineering effort. The behavioral scientists at Yale, led by President [[James R. Angell]] and psychobiologist [[Robert M. Yerkes]], tapped into foundation largesse by crafting research programs aimed to investigate, then suggest, ways to control sexual and social behavior. For example, Yerkes analyzed chimpanzee sexual behavior in hopes of illuminating the evolutionary underpinnings of human development and providing information that could ameliorate dysfunction. Ultimately, the behavioral-science results disappointed foundation officers, who shifted their human-engineering funds toward biological sciences.<ref>Kersten Jacobson Biehn, "Psychobiology, Sex Research and Chimpanzees: Philanthropic Foundation Support for the Behavioral Sciences at Yale University, 1923–41," ''History of the Human Sciences'' 2008 21(2): 21–43,</ref>

[[File:A View of the Buildings of Yale College at New Haven 1807.jpg|thumb|Old Brick Row in 1807]]

====Biology====
Slack (2003) compares three groups that conducted biological research at Yale during overlapping periods between 1910 and 1970. Yale proved important as a site for this research. The leaders of these groups were [[Ross Granville Harrison]], [[Grace E. Pickford]], and [[G.&nbsp;Evelyn Hutchinson]], and their members included both graduate students and more experienced scientists. All produced innovative research, including the opening of new subfields in embryology, endocrinology, and ecology, respectively, over a long period of time. Harrison's group is shown to have been a classic research school; Pickford's and Hutchinson's were not. Pickford's group was successful in spite of her lack of departmental or institutional position or power. Hutchinson and his graduate and postgraduate students were extremely productive, but in diverse areas of ecology rather than one focused area of research or the use of one set of research tools. Hutchinson's example shows that new models for research groups are needed, especially for those that include extensive field research.<ref>Nancy G. Slack, "Are Research Schools Necessary? Contrasting Models of 20th Century Research at Yale Led by Ross Granville Harrison, Grace E. Pickford and G. Evelyn Hutchinson," ''Journal of the History of Biology'' 2003 36(3): 501–529,</ref>

====Medicine====
Milton Winternitz led the [[Yale School of Medicine]] as its dean from 1920 to 1935. Dedicated to the new scientific medicine established in Germany, he was equally fervent about "social medicine" and the study of humans in their culture and environment. He established the "Yale System" of teaching, with few lectures and fewer exams, and strengthened the full-time faculty system; he also created the graduate-level Yale School of Nursing and the Psychiatry Department, and built numerous new buildings. Progress toward his plans for an Institute of Human Relations, envisioned as a refuge where social scientists would collaborate with biological scientists in a holistic study of humankind, unfortunately lasted for only a few years before the opposition of resentful anti-Semitic colleagues drove him to resign.<ref>Howard Spiro and Priscilla Waters Norton, "Dean Milton C. Winternitz at Yale," ''Perspectives in Biology & Medicine'' 2003 46(3): 403–412,</ref>

====Faculty====
Before [[World War&nbsp;II]], most elite university faculties counted among their numbers few, if any, Jews, blacks, women, or other minorities; Yale was no exception. By 1980, this condition had been altered dramatically, as numerous members of those groups held faculty positions.<ref>William Palmer, "On or about 1950 or 1955 History Departments Changed: A Step in the Creation of the Modern History Department," ''Journal of the Historical Society'' (1529921x); 2007 7(3): 385–405</ref>

====History and American studies====
The American studies program reflected the worldwide anti-Communist ideological struggle. [[Norman Holmes Pearson]], who worked for the Office of Strategic Studies in London during World War II, returned to Yale and headed the new American studies program, in which scholarship quickly became an instrument of promoting liberty. Popular among undergraduates, the program sought to instruct them in the fundamentals of American civilization and thereby instill a sense of nationalism and national purpose.<ref>Michael Holzman, "The Ideological Origins of American Studies at Yale," ''American Studies'' 40:2 (Summer 1999): 71–99</ref> Also during the 1940s and 1950s, Wyoming millionaire [[William Robertson Coe]] made large contributions to the American studies programs at Yale University and at the University of Wyoming. Coe was concerned to celebrate the 'values' of the Western United States in order to meet the "threat of communism".<ref>Liza Nicholas, "Wyoming as America: Celebrations, a Museum, and Yale," ''American Quarterly'', Vol. 54, No. 3 (Sep. 2002), pp. 437–465 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/30042228 in JSTOR]</ref>

====Women====
In 1793, [[Lucinda Foote]] passed the entrance exams for Yale College, but was rejected by the President on the basis of her gender.<ref name="bookof">{{cite book|last1=Griffin|first1=Lynne|last2=McCann|first2=Kelly|title=The Book of Women : 300 Notable Women History Passed By|date=1995|publisher=Adams Pub.|location=Holbrook, Mass|isbn=978-1-558505-162|page=103}}</ref> Women studied at Yale University as early as 1892, in graduate-level programs at the [[Yale Graduate School of Arts and Sciences]].<ref>[http://www.library.yale.edu/mssa/YHO/brief_history.html A Brief History of Yale :: Resources on Yale History].

In 1966, Yale began discussions with its [[sister school]] [[Vassar College]] about merging to foster coeducation at the undergraduate level. Vassar, then all-female and part of the [[Seven Sisters (colleges)|Seven Sisters]]—elite higher education schools that historically served as sister institutions to the [[Ivy League]] when most Ivy League institutions still only admitted men—tentatively accepted, but then declined the invitation. Both schools introduced coeducation independently in 1969.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://vcencyclopedia.vassar.edu/index.php/A_History_of_the_Curriculum_1865-1970s |title=A History of the Curriculum 1865-1970s – Vassar College Encyclopedia |publisher=Vassar.edu |accessdate=December 4, 2011}}</ref> Amy Solomon was the first woman to register as a Yale undergraduate;<ref>Yale Bulletin and Calendar: [http://www.yale.edu/opa/arc-ybc/v29.n23/story4.html "Transformations brought about by Yale women."] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090418113034/http://www.yale.edu/opa/arc-ybc/v29.n23/story4.html |date=April 18, 2009 }}.

A decade into co-education, student assault and harassment by faculty became the impetus for the trailblazing lawsuit [[Alexander v. Yale]]. While unsuccessful in the courts, the legal reasoning behind the case changed the landscape of sex discrimination law and resulted in the establishment of Yale's Grievance Board and the Yale Women's Center.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mcolaw.com/docs/ao_tobreakthesilence_speech.pdf |title=To Break the Silence |format=PDF |accessdate=December 4, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110714063453/http://www.mcolaw.com/docs/ao_tobreakthesilence_speech.pdf |archivedate=July 14, 2011 |df= }}</ref> In March 2011 a [[Title IX]] complaint was filed against Yale by students and recent graduates, including editors of Yale's feminist magazine [[Broad Recognition]], alleging that the university had a hostile sexual climate.<ref>Huffington Post: [http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/03/31/yale-students-file-title-_n_843306.html "Yale Students File Title IX Suit Against the University"].

====Class====
Yale, like other Ivy League schools, instituted policies in the early 20th century designed to maintain the proportion of white Protestants from notable families in the student body (see ''[[numerus clausus]]''), and was one of the last of the Ivies to eliminate such preferences, beginning with the class of 1970.<ref>''[[Yale Alumni Magazine]]'': [http://www.yalealumnimagazine.com/issues/99_12/admissions.html "The Birth of a New Institution."] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100314164351/http://www.yalealumnimagazine.com/issues/99_12/admissions.html |date=March 14, 2010 }}. Retrieved April 10, 2007.</ref>

====Town–gown relations====
Yale has a complicated relationship with its home city; for example, thousands of students volunteer every year in a myriad of community organizations, but city officials, who decry Yale's exemption from local property taxes, have long pressed the university to do more to help. Under President Levin, Yale has financially supported many of New Haven's efforts to reinvigorate the city. Evidence suggests that the [[town and gown]] relationships are mutually beneficial. Still, the economic power of the university increased dramatically with its financial success amid a decline in the local economy.<ref>Gordon Lafer, "Land and Labor in the Post-Industrial University Town: Remaking Social Geography," ''Political Geography'' 2003 22(1): 89–117, focuses on Yale.</ref>

===21st century===
In 2006, Yale and [[Peking University]] (PKU) established a Joint Undergraduate Program in Beijing, an exchange program allowing Yale students to spend a semester living and studying with PKU honor students.<ref name="yalePKU2012">{{cite web |url=http://www.yaledailynews.com/news/2012/jul/27/end-yale-pku-admins-hopes-unfulfilled/ |title=With end of Yale-PKU, admins' hopes unfulfilled |first1=Gavan |last1=Gideon |first2=Daniel |last2=Sisgoreo |first3=Tapley |last3=Stephenson |work=[[Yale Daily News]] |date=July 27, 2012 |publisher=The Yale Daily News Publishing Company |location=New Haven, CT, USA |accessdate=August 1, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120730073411/http://www.yaledailynews.com/news/2012/jul/27/end-yale-pku-admins-hopes-unfulfilled/ |archivedate=July 30, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> In July 2012, the Peking University-Yale University Program ended due to weak participation.<ref name="yalePKU2012"/>

In 2007 outgoing Yale President [[Rick Levin]] characterized Yale's institutional priorities: "First, among the nation's finest research universities, Yale is distinctively committed to excellence in undergraduate education. Second, in our graduate and professional schools, as well as in Yale College, we are committed to the education of leaders."<ref>{{cite magazine|magazine=Yale Alumni Magazine|url=http://www.yalealumnimagazine.com/issues/96_12/levin.html|title=Preparing for Yale's Fourth Century|accessdate=April 10, 2007|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061110095617/http://www.yalealumnimagazine.com/issues/96_12/levin.html|archivedate=November 10, 2006|df=mdy-all}}</ref>

President [[George W. Bush]], a Yale alumnus, criticized the university for the snobbery and intellectual arrogance he encountered as a student there.<ref>{{cite web |last=Carney |first=James |url=http://content.time.com/time/nation/article/0,8599,127630,00.html |title=George W's Love-Hate Affair with Yale |work=[[TIME (magazine)|TIME]] |date=May 23, 2001|accessdate=April 21, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last=Chen |first=Edwin |url=http://articles.latimes.com/2001/may/22/news/mn-1027 |title=Bush Returns to Yale, Gives Graduates the Last Laugh |publisher=''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' |date=May 22, 2001|accessdate=April 21, 2015}}</ref>

The ''[[Boston Globe]]'' wrote that "if there's one school that can lay claim to educating the nation's top national leaders over the past three decades, it's Yale".<ref name="Magazine p. 6">''[[Boston Globe]]'' November 17, 2002, Magazine, p. 6</ref> [[Yale alumni]] were represented on the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] or [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] ticket in every U.S. Presidential election between 1972 and 2004. Yale-educated Presidents since the end of the [[Vietnam War]] include [[Gerald Ford]], [[George H.W. Bush]], [[Bill Clinton]], and [[George W. Bush]], and major-party nominees during this period include [[Hillary Clinton]] (2016), [[John Kerry]] (2004), [[Joseph Lieberman]] (Vice President, 2000), and [[Sargent Shriver]] (Vice President, 1972). Other Yale alumni who made serious bids for the Presidency during this period include [[Howard Dean]] (2004), [[Gary Hart]] (1984 and 1988), [[Paul Tsongas]] (1992), [[Pat Robertson]] (1988) and [[Jerry Brown]] (1976, 1980, 1992).

Several explanations have been offered for Yale's representation in national elections since the end of the Vietnam War. Various sources note the spirit of campus activism that has existed at Yale since the 1960s, and the intellectual influence of Reverend [[William Sloane Coffin]] on many of the future candidates.<ref name="ReferenceA">''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' October 4, 2000, p.

The [[President and Fellows of Yale College]], also known as the Yale Corporation, is the governing board of the university.

Yale's former president [[Richard C. Levin]] was, at the time, one of the highest paid university presidents in the United States with a 2008 salary of $1.5 million.<ref>{{cite news|title=Million-dollar college presidents on the rise|work=Washington Post|date=November 15, 2010|first=Daniel|last=de Vise|page=B1}}</ref>

The Yale Provost's Office has launched several women into prominent university presidencies. In 1977 [[Hanna Holborn Gray]] was appointed acting President of Yale from this position, and went on to become President of the [[University of Chicago]], the first woman to be full president of a major university. In 1994 Yale Provost [[Judith Rodin]] became the first female president of an Ivy League institution at the [[University of Pennsylvania]]. In 2002 Provost [[Alison Richard]] became the Vice Chancellor of the [[University of Cambridge]]. In 2004, Provost [[Susan Hockfield]] became the President of the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]]. In 2007 Deputy Provost [[H. Kim Bottomly]] was named President of [[Wellesley College]]. In 2003, the Dean of the Divinity School, [[Rebecca Chopp]], was appointed president of Colgate University and now heads Swarthmore College.

The university has three major academic components: Yale College (the undergraduate program), the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences, and the professional schools.<ref>{{cite web|title=Yale University – Academic Schools|url=http://www.yale.edu/schools/index.html|publisher=Yale University|accessdate=September 9, 2013}}</ref> In 2008 Provost [[Andrew D.

Many of Yale's buildings were constructed in the [[Collegiate Gothic]] architecture style from 1917 to 1931, financed largely by [[Edward S. Harkness]], including the [[Yale Drama School]].<ref>Synnott, Marcia Graham.

Similarly, the decorative [[frieze]]s on the buildings depict contemporary scenes such as policemen chasing a robber and arresting a prostitute (on the wall of the Law School), or a student relaxing with a mug of beer and a cigarette.

In fact, the buildings merely simulate Middle Ages architecture, for though they appear to be constructed of solid stone blocks in the authentic manner, most actually have steel framing as was commonly used in 1930. One exception is [[Harkness Tower]], {{convert|216|ft|m|0}} tall, which was originally a free-standing stone structure. It was reinforced in 1964 to allow the installation of the [[Yale Memorial Carillon]].

The oldest building on campus, [[Connecticut Hall]] (built in 1750), is in the [[Georgian architecture|Georgian style]]. Georgian-style buildings erected from 1929 to 1933 include [[Timothy Dwight College]], [[Pierson College]], and [[Davenport College]], except the latter's east, York Street façade, which was constructed in the [[Gothic architecture|Gothic style]] so as to co-ordinate with adjacent structures.

The [[Beinecke Rare Book and Manuscript Library]], designed by [[Gordon Bunshaft]] of [[Skidmore, Owings & Merrill]], is one of the largest buildings in the world reserved exclusively for the preservation of rare books and manuscripts.<ref>Beinecke Rare Book Library: [http://www.library.yale.edu/beinecke/brblinfo/brblslides.html "About the Library Building."]. Retrieved April 10, 2007.</ref> It is located near the center of the University in [[Hewitt Quadrangle]], which is now more commonly referred to as "[[Beinecke Plaza]]".

The library's six-story above-ground tower of book stacks is surrounded by a windowless rectangular building with walls made of translucent Vermont marble, which transmit subdued lighting to the interior and provide protection from direct light, while glowing from within after dark.

The sculptures in the sunken courtyard by [[Isamu Noguchi]] are said to represent time (the pyramid), the sun (the circle), and chance (the cube).

Alumnus [[Eero Saarinen]], Finnish-American architect of such notable structures as the [[Gateway Arch]] in St.&nbsp;Louis, [[Washington Dulles International Airport]] main terminal, [[Bell Labs Holmdel Complex]] and the [[CBS Building]] in Manhattan, designed [[Ingalls Rink]] at Yale and the residential colleges Ezra Stiles and Morse. These latter were modelled after the medieval Italian hilltown of [[San Gimignano]] – a prototype chosen for the town's pedestrian-friendly milieu and fortress-like stone towers.

====Campus safety====
Several campus safety strategies have been pioneered at Yale. The first campus police force was founded at Yale in 1894, when the university contracted city police officers to exclusively cover the campus.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Sloan |first=John J. |title=Modern Campus Police: An Analysis of Their Evolution, Structure, and Function |journal=American Journal of Police |date=1991 |volume=11 |issue=2 |pages=85–104}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last=Powell |title=The Beginning—Yale Campus Police Department—1894 |journal=Campus Law Enforcement Journal |volume=24 |pages=2–5}}</ref> Later hired by the university, the officers were originally brought in to quell unrest between students and city residents and curb destructive student behavior.<ref>{{cite book |last=Gehrand |first=Keith A. |chapter=Higher Education Policing: The New Millennium |title=IACLEA 50th Anniversary Commemorative Publication |publisher=International Association of Campus Law Enforcement Administrators |date=2008 |pages=67–68 |url=http://iaclea.org/visitors/PDFs/IACLEA-ContentPages_67-126.pdf |accessdate=May 5, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last=Kurtz-Phelan |first=Daniel |title=Crossing Enemy Lines |magazine=The New Journal |date=April 1, 2002 |url=http://www.thenewjournalatyale.com/2002/04/crossing-enemy-lines/ |accessdate=May 5, 2015}}</ref> In addition to the Yale Police Department, a variety of safety services are available including blue phones, a [[safety escort]], and 24-hour shuttle service.

In the 1970s and 1980s, [[Connecticut locations by per capita income|poverty]] and [[violent crime]] rose in New Haven, dampening Yale's student and faculty recruiting efforts.<ref>AJ Giannini.

===Collections===
[[File:Le café de nuit (The Night Café) by Vincent van Gogh.jpeg|thumb|left|''[[The Night Café]]'', Vincent van Gogh, 1888, [[Yale University Art Gallery|Yale Art Gallery]]]]
[[Yale University Library]], which holds over 15 million volumes, is the third-largest university collection in the United States.<ref name="2013LibraryReport"/><ref>{{cite report |title=ARL Statistics 2011–2012 |date=2012 |publisher=Association of Research Libraries |page=53 |url=http://publications.arl.org/ARL-Statistics-2011-2012/ |accessdate=July 1, 2014}}</ref> The main library, [[Sterling Memorial Library]], contains about 4&nbsp;million volumes, and other holdings are dispersed at subject libraries.

Rare books are found in several Yale collections. The [[Beinecke Rare Book Library]] has a large collection of rare books and manuscripts. The [[Harvey Cushing/John Hay Whitney Medical Library]] includes important historical medical texts, including an impressive collection of rare books, as well as historical medical instruments. The [[Lewis Walpole Library]] contains the largest collection of 18th‑century British literary works. The [[Elizabethan Club]], technically a private organization, makes its Elizabethan folios and first editions available to qualified researchers through Yale.

Yale's museum collections are also of international stature. The [[Yale University Art Gallery]], the country's first university-affiliated art museum, contains more than 180,000 works, including Old Masters and important collections of modern art, in the Swartout and Kahn buildings. The latter, [[Louis Kahn]]'s first large-scale American work (1953), was renovated and reopened in December 2006. The [[Yale Center for British Art]], the largest collection of British art outside of the UK, grew from a gift of [[Paul Mellon]] and is housed in another Kahn-designed building.

The [[Peabody Museum of Natural History]] in New Haven is used by school children and contains research collections in anthropology, archaeology, and the natural environment. The [[Yale University Collection of Musical Instruments]], affiliated with the Yale School of Music, is perhaps the least-known of Yale's collections, because its hours of opening are restricted.

The museums once housed the artifacts brought to the United States from [[Peru]] by Yale history professor [[Hiram Bingham III|Hiram Bingham]] in his Yale-financed expedition to [[Machu Picchu]] in 1912 – when the removal of such artifacts was legal. The artifacts were restored to Peru in 2012.<ref>{{Citation | last= Zorthian | first= Julia | date= 12 November 2012 | title= Yale returns final Machu Picchu artifacts | publisher= Yale Daily News | publication-place = New Haven, Connecticut | url= https://yaledailynews.com/blog/2012/11/12/yale-returns-final-machu-picchu-artifacts/ | accessdate = 31 August 2018 }}</ref>

The ''[[U.S. News & World Report]]'' ranked Yale 3rd among U.S. national universities for 2016,<ref name=":0">{{cite web|url=http://colleges.usnews.rankingsandreviews.com/best-colleges/rankings/national-universities |title=National University Rankings |publisher=''U.S. News & World Report'' |accessdate=November 7, 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110521210513/http://colleges.usnews.rankingsandreviews.com/best-colleges/rankings/national-universities |archivedate=May 21, 2011 |df= }}</ref> as it has for each of the past sixteen years, in every list trailing only Princeton and Harvard.

In the international sphere, it was ranked 11th in the 2016 [[Academic Ranking of World Universities]], 10th in the 2016-17 Nature Index<ref>{{cite web|title=Global universities ranked by a different measure|url=https://www.natureindex.com/news-blog/global-universities-ranked-by-a-different-measure|publisher=Nature Index}}</ref> for quality of scientific research output, and 10th in the 2016 CWUR World University Rankings.<ref>{{cite web|title=CWUR 2016 - World University Rankings|url=http://cwur.org/2016.php|website=CWUR|publisher=Center For World University Rankings}}</ref> The university was also ranked 6th in the 2016 Times Higher Education (THE) Global University Employability Rankings<ref>{{cite web|title=Best universities for graduate jobs: Global University Employability Ranking 2016|url=https://www.timeshighereducation.com/student/news/best-universities-graduate-jobs-global-university-employability-ranking-2016|website=THE|publisher=Times Higher Education}}</ref> and 8th in the THE Academic World Reputation Rankings.<ref>{{cite web|title=World Reputation Rankings 2016|url=https://www.timeshighereducation.com/world-university-rankings/2016/reputation-ranking#!/page/0/length/25/sort_by/rank/sort_order/asc/cols/stats|website=timeshighereducation.com|publisher=Times Higher Education|accessdate=June 11, 2017}}</ref>

===Faculty, research, and intellectual traditions===
Yale's faculty include 61 members of the [[National Academy of Sciences]],<ref>{{cite web|title=Member Profiles|url=http://www.nasonline.org/member-directory/|website=National Academy of Sciences|accessdate=March 24, 2017}}</ref> 7 members of the [[National Academy of Engineering]]<ref>{{cite web|title=Members Directory|url=https://www.nae.edu/MembersSection/20412.aspx?id=20412|website=NAE Website|accessdate=March 24, 2017}}</ref> and 49 members of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. The college is, after normalization for institution size, the tenth-largest baccalaureate source of [[doctorate|doctoral degree]] recipients in the United States, and the largest such source within the Ivy League.<ref>[http://web.centre.edu/ir/student/OverallBaccOrigins.pdf Centre.edu] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927004904/https://web.centre.edu/ir/student/OverallBaccOrigins.pdf |date=September 27, 2007 }} "Baccalaureate Origins Peer Analysis 2000, Center College."</ref>

Yale's English and Comparative Literature departments were part of the [[New Criticism]] movement. Of the New Critics, [[Robert Penn Warren]], [[W.K. Wimsatt]], and [[Cleanth Brooks]] were all Yale faculty. Later, the Yale Comparative literature department became a center of American [[deconstruction]]. [[Jacques Derrida]], the father of deconstruction, taught at the Department of Comparative Literature from the late seventies to mid-1980s. Several other Yale faculty members were also associated with deconstruction, forming the so-called "[[Yale school (deconstruction)|Yale School]]". These included [[Paul de Man]] who taught in the Departments of Comparative Literature and French, [[J.&nbsp;Hillis Miller]], [[Geoffrey Hartman]] (both taught in the Departments of English and Comparative Literature), and [[Harold Bloom]] (English), whose theoretical position was always somewhat specific, and who ultimately took a very different path from the rest of this group. Yale's history department has also originated important intellectual trends. Historians [[C.&nbsp;Vann Woodward]] and [[David Brion Davis]] are credited with beginning in the 1960s and 1970s an important stream of [[American South|southern]] historians; likewise, [[David Montgomery (historian)|David Montgomery]], a labor historian, advised many of the current generation of labor historians in the country. Yale's Music School and Department fostered the growth of Music Theory in the latter half of the 20th&nbsp;century. The ''Journal of Music Theory'' was founded there in 1957; [[Allen Forte]] and [[David Lewin]] were influential teachers and scholars.

Since summer 2010, Yale has also been host to [[Yale Publishing Course]].

In addition to eminent faculty members, Yale research relies heavily on the presence of roughly 1200 [[postdoctoral researcher|Postdocs]] from various national and international origin working in the multiple laboratories in the sciences, social sciences, humanities, and professional schools of the University. The university progressively recognized this working force with the recent creation of the Office for Postdoctoral Affairs and the [[Yale Postdoctoral Association]].

==Campus life==
Yale is a medium-sized research university, most of whose students are in the [[Graduate school|graduate]] and [[Professional school|professional]] schools. [[Undergraduate education|Undergraduates]], or [[Yale College]] students, come from a variety of ethnic, national, socioeconomic backgrounds, and personal backgrounds. Of the 2010–2011 freshman class, 10% are non‑U.S. citizens, while 54% went to public high schools.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.yale.edu/oir/factsheet.html#Yale%20College%20Student%20Body%20Characteristics |title=Yale Factsheet |publisher=Yale.edu |accessdate=December 4, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070403080525/http://www.yale.edu/oir/factsheet.html#Yale%20College%20Student%20Body%20Characteristics |archivedate=April 3, 2007 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>

===Residential colleges===
{{Main|Residential colleges of Yale University}}
Yale's [[residential college]] system was established in 1933 by [[Edward S. Harkness]], who admired the social intimacy of Oxford and Cambridge and donated significant funds to found similar [[Collegiate university|colleges]] at Yale and Harvard. Though Yale's colleges resemble their English precursors organizationally and architecturally, they are [[Collegiate university#Dependent colleges|dependent entities]] of Yale College and have limited autonomy. The colleges are led by a head and an academic dean, who reside in the college, and university faculty and affiliates comprise each college's fellowship. Colleges offer their own seminars, social events, and speaking engagements known as "Master's Teas," but do not contain programs of study or academic departments. Instead, all undergraduate courses are taught by the Faculty of Arts and Sciences and are open to members of any college.

All undergraduates are members of a college, to which they are assigned before their freshman year, and 85 percent live in the college quadrangle or a college-affiliated dormitory.<ref>{{cite news |author1-last=Lloyd-Thomas |author1-first=Matthew |author2-last=Rodrigues |author2-first=Adrian |title=New colleges to help reduce overcrowding |newspaper=Yale Daily News |date=April 15, 2014 |url=http://yaledailynews.com/blog/2014/04/15/new-colleges-to-help-reduce-overcrowding/ |accessdate=September 6, 2014}}</ref> While the majority of upperclassman live in the colleges, most on-campus freshmen live on the [[Old Campus]], the university's oldest precinct.

While Harkness' original colleges were [[Georgian architecture|Georgian Revival]] or [[Collegiate Gothic]] in style, two colleges constructed in the 1960s, [[Morse College|Morse]] and [[Ezra Stiles College|Ezra Stiles]] Colleges, have modernist designs. All twelve college quadrangles are organized around a courtyard, and each has a dining hall, courtyard, library, common room, and a range of student facilities. The twelve colleges are named for important alumni or significant places in university history. In 2017, the university opened two new colleges near [[Science Hill (Yale University)|Science Hill]].<ref>Yale University Office of Public Affairs: [http://opa.yale.edu/news/article.aspx?id=5868 "Yale to Establish Two New Residential Colleges."] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080608050148/https://opa.yale.edu/news/article.aspx?id=5868 |date=June 8, 2008 }}.

====Calhoun College====

Since the 1960s, [[John C.

The racially motivated [[Charleston church shooting|church shooting]] in [[Charleston, South Carolina]], led to renewed calls in the summer of 2015 for [[Calhoun College]], one of 12 residential colleges, to be renamed. In July 2015 students signed a petition calling for the name change.<ref name="student-petition-2015"/> They argued in the petition that—while Calhoun was respected in the 19th century as an "extraordinary American statesman"—he was "one of the most prolific defenders of slavery and white supremacy" in the history of the United States.<ref name="student-petition-2015" /><ref name="theatlantic_2015_rename_Calhoun"/> In August 2015 Yale President Peter Salovey addressed the Freshman Class of 2019 in which he responded to the racial tensions but explained why the college would not be renamed.<ref name="Freshman_address_aug_2015"/> He described Calhoun as "a notable political theorist, a vice president to two different U.S. presidents, a secretary of war and of state, and a congressman and senator representing South Carolina".<ref name="Freshman_address_aug_2015" /> He acknowledged that Calhoun also "believed that the highest forms of civilization depend on involuntary servitude.

In April 2016 Salovey announced that "despite decades of vigorous alumni and student protests," Calhoun's name will remain on the Yale residential college<ref name="NYT_April_2016_right_wrong">{{citation |title=At Yale, a Right That Doesn't Outweigh a Wrong |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/30/opinion/at-yale-a-right-that-doesnt-outweigh-a-wrong.html |work=New York Times |date=April 30, 2016 |accessdate=April 30, 2016 |first=Glenda Elizabeth |last=Glenmore |location=New Haven}}</ref> explaining that it is preferable for Yale students to live in Calhoun's "shadow" so they will be "better prepared to rise to the challenges of the present and the future". He claimed that if they removed Calhoun's name, it would "obscure" his "legacy of slavery rather than addressing it".<ref name="NYT_April_2016_right_wrong" /> "Yale is part of that history" and "We cannot erase American history, but we can confront it, teach it and learn from it."

===Student organizations===
In 2014, Yale had 385 registered student organizations, plus an additional one hundred groups in the process of registration.<ref>Wesley Yiin, [http://yaledailynews.com/blog/2014/04/09/up-close-how-many-is-too-many/ Up Close: How many is too many?], ''Yale Daily News'' (April 9, 2014).</ref>

The university hosts a variety of student journals, magazines, and newspapers. Established in 1872, ''[[The Yale Record]]'' is the world's oldest [[humor magazine]]. Newspapers include the ''[[Yale Daily News]]'', which was first published in 1878, and the weekly ''[[Yale Herald]]'', which was first published in 1986. Dwight Hall, an independent, non-profit community service organization, oversees more than 2,000 Yale undergraduates working on more than 70 community service initiatives in New Haven. The Yale College Council runs several agencies that oversee campus wide activities and student services. The [[Yale Dramatic Association]] and Bulldog Productions cater to the theater and film communities, respectively. In addition, the Yale Drama Coalition<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.yaledramacoalition.org|title=Yale Drama Coalition|publisher=}}</ref> serves to coordinate between and provide resources for the various Sudler Fund sponsored theater productions which run each weekend. WYBC Yale Radio<ref>{{cite web|url=http://wybc.com|title=WYBC – Yale Radio|work=wybc.com}}</ref> is the campus's radio station, owned and operated by students. While students used to broadcast on AM and FM frequencies, they now have an Internet-only stream.

The [[Yale College Council]] (YCC) serves as the campus's undergraduate student government. All registered student organizations are regulated and funded by a subsidiary organization of the YCC, known as the Undergraduate Organizations Funding Committee (UOFC).<ref name="UOFC">{{cite web|url=https://www.ycc.yale.edu/about-uofc/|title=About UOFC|publisher=Yale College Council|accessdate=May 17, 2018}}</ref> The Graduate and Professional Student Senate (GPSS) serves as Yale's graduate and professional student government.

[[The Yale Political Union]] is advised by alumni political leaders such as [[John Kerry]] and [[George Pataki]]. The Yale International Relations Association functions as the umbrella organization for the top-ranked Model UN team.

The campus includes several [[fraternities and sororities]]. The campus features at least 18 [[a&nbsp;cappella]] groups, the most famous of which is [[The Whiffenpoofs]], who are unusual among college singing groups in being made up solely of senior men.

Yale's [[secret society|secret societies]] [[Collegiate secret societies in North America#Yale University|include]] [[Skull and Bones]], [[Scroll and Key]], [[Wolf's Head (secret society)|Wolf's Head]], [[Book and Snake]], [[Elihu (secret society)|Elihu]], [[Berzelius (secret society)|Berzelius]], [[St. Elmo (secret society)|St.&nbsp;Elmo]], [[Manuscript Society|Manuscript]], [[Shabtai (society)|Shabtai]], [[Myth and Sword]], [[Mace and Chain]] and [[Sage and Chalice]]. The two oldest existing honor societies are the [[Aurelian Honor Society|Aurelian]] (1910) and the Torch Honor Society (1916).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.library.yale.edu/mssa/YHO/ExtracurricularandSocialOrganizations.pdf |title=In Focus &#124; Yale University Library |publisher=Library.yale.edu |date=May 19, 2014 |accessdate=August 14, 2014}}</ref>

The [[Elizabethan Club]], a social club, has a membership of undergraduates, graduates, faculty and staff with literary or artistic interests. Membership is by invitation. Members and their guests may enter the "Lizzie's" premises for conversation and tea.

Yale supports 35 varsity athletic teams that compete in the [[Ivy League]] Conference, the [[Eastern College Athletic Conference]], the [[New England Intercollegiate Sailing Association]]. Yale athletic teams compete intercollegiately at the [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]] Division&nbsp;I level. Like other members of the Ivy League, Yale does not offer athletic scholarships.

Yale has numerous athletic facilities, including the [[Yale Bowl]] (the nation's first natural "bowl" stadium, and prototype for such stadiums as the [[Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum]] and the [[Rose Bowl (stadium)|Rose Bowl]]), located at The [[Walter Camp]] Field athletic complex, and the [[Payne Whitney Gymnasium]], the second-largest indoor athletic complex in the world.<ref>''[[Yale Herald]]'': [http://www.yaleherald.com/archive/frosh/2000/field/p78payne.html "House of Payne gets ready for the new millennium."

In 2016, the men's basketball team won the Ivy League Championship title for the first time in 54 years, earning a spot in the [[NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament]]. In the first round of the tournament, the Bulldogs beat the Baylor Bears 79-75 in the school's first-ever tournament win.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.amny.com/sports/photos/yale-men-s-basketball-stuns-baylor-in-march-madness-1.11588208|title=Yale stuns Baylor in NCAA Tournament|publisher=}}</ref>

October 21, 2000, marked the dedication of Yale's fourth new boathouse in 157&nbsp;years of collegiate rowing. The [[Gilder Boathouse]] is named to honor former Olympic rower Virginia Gilder&nbsp;'79 and her father Richard Gilder&nbsp;'54, who gave $4&nbsp;million towards the $7.5&nbsp;million project. Yale also maintains the [[Gales Ferry]] site where the heavyweight men's team trains for the [[Yale-Harvard Boat Race]].

Yale crew is the oldest collegiate athletic team in America, and won [[Olympics|Olympic Games]] [[Gold Medal]] for men's eights in 1924 and 1956. The [[Yale Corinthian Yacht Club]], founded in 1881, is the oldest collegiate [[sailing]] club in the world.

In 1896, Yale and [[Johns Hopkins University|Johns Hopkins]] played the first known [[ice hockey]] game in the United States. Since 2006, the school's ice hockey clubs have played a commemorative game.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.yale.edu/clubhockey/teamhistory.html |title=Yale Club Ice Hockey |publisher=Yale.edu |date=October 19, 2007 |accessdate=September 16, 2009}}</ref>

For kicks, between 1954 and 1982, residential college teams and student organizations played [[bladderball]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Muller |first=Eli |url=http://www.yaledailynews.com/news/university-news/2001/02/28/bladderball-30-years-of-zany-antics-dangerous-fun/ |title=Bladderball: 30 years of zany antics, dangerous fun |publisher=Yale Daily News |date=February 28, 2001 |accessdate=December 4, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100205004002/http://www.yaledailynews.com/news/university-news/2001/02/28/bladderball-30-years-of-zany-antics-dangerous-fun/ |archivedate=February 5, 2010 |df= }}</ref>

Yale students claim to have invented [[Frisbee]], by tossing empty [[Frisbie Pie Company]] tins.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.yaledailynews.com/news/2007/nov/05/local-pie-tin-first-frisbee-legend-holds/|title=Local pie tin first Frisbee, legend holds|publisher=Yale Daily News|accessdate=September 1, 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110606082521/http://www.yaledailynews.com/news/2007/nov/05/local-pie-tin-first-frisbee-legend-holds/|archivedate=June 6, 2011|df=mdy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ct.gov/ctportal/cwp/view.asp?a=843&q=246434 |title=About Connecticut: General Description and Facts|publisher=Connecticut State Government|accessdate=September 1, 2010}}</ref>

Yale athletics are supported by the [[Yale Precision Marching Band]]. "Precision" is used here ironically; the band is a scatter-style band that runs wildly between formations rather than actually marching.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.yale.edu/yaleband/ypmb/faq.html|title= Yale Precision Marching Band Frequently Asked Questions|accessdate= December 14, 2009|quote= "The YPMB is one of twelve scatter-style marching bands in the country....Between formations we run around wildly.|deadurl= yes|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20091225104413/http://www.yale.edu/yaleband/ypmb/faq.html|archivedate= December 25, 2009|df= mdy-all}}</ref> The band attends every home football game and many away, as well as most hockey and basketball games throughout the winter.

Yale intramural sports are also a significant aspect of student life. Students compete for their respective residential colleges, fostering a friendly rivalry. The year is divided into fall, winter, and spring seasons, each of which includes about ten different sports. About half the sports are coeducational. At the end of the year, the residential college with the most points (not all sports count equally) wins the Tyng Cup.

====Song====
Notable among the songs commonly played and sung at events such as [[graduation|commencement]], [[convocation]], alumni gatherings, and athletic games are the alma mater, "[[Bright College Years]]", and the Yale [[fight song]], "Down the Field".<!--Down the Field is NOT the Yale fight song-->

Two other fight songs, "Bulldog, Bulldog" and "Bingo Eli Yale", written by [[Cole Porter]] during his undergraduate days, are still sung at football games. Another fight song sung at games is "[[Boola Boola]]". According to ''College Fight Songs: An Annotated Anthology'' published in 1998, "Down the Field" ranks as the fourth-greatest fight song of all time.<ref>{{cite web|title=Victory March rated No. 1 college fight song |url=http://newsinfo.nd.edu/news/6427-victory-march-rated-no-1-college-fight-song/|publisher=University of Notre Dame News|accessdate=September 1, 2010}}</ref>

====Mascot====
The school mascot is "[[Handsome Dan]]," the Yale [[bulldog]], and the Yale [[fight song]] (written by [[Cole Porter]] while he was a student at Yale) contains the [[refrain]], "Bulldog, bulldog, bow wow wow". The school color, since 1894, is [[Yale Blue]].<ref>(prior to 1894, Yale's color was green) (see: {{cite web|url=http://www.thenewjournalatyale.com/2002/10/true-blue/|title=True Blue|first=Ellen |last=Thompson|publisher=The New Journal|date=October 1, 2002|accessdate=January 4, 2012}})</ref> Yale's [[Handsome Dan]] is believed to be the first college [[mascot]] in America, having been established in 1889.<ref name = "YaleBulldogs">{{cite web | url = http://yalebulldogs.cstv.com/trads/mascot.html | title = History of the Yale Bulldog "Handsome Dan" | work = Yale Bulldogs | accessdate =June 8, 2007 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070605212605/http://yalebulldogs.cstv.com/trads/mascot.html |archivedate = June 5, 2007}}</ref>

===Benefactors===
Yale has had many financial supporters, but some stand out by the magnitude or timeliness of their contributions. Among those who have made large donations commemorated at the university are: [[Elihu Yale]]; [[Jeremiah Dummer]]; the [[Harkness Tower|Harkness]] family ([[Edward S. Harkness|Edward]], [[Anna M. Harkness|Anna]], and [[William Harkness|William]]); the [[Beinecke Rare Book and Manuscript Library|Beinecke]] family (Edwin, Frederick, and Walter); [[John William Sterling]]; [[Payne Whitney]]; [[Joseph Earl Sheffield]], [[Paul Mellon]], [[Charles B.&nbsp;G.
