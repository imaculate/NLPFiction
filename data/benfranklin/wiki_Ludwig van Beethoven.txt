'''Ludwig van Beethoven''' ({{IPAc-en|audio=En-LudwigVanBeethoven.ogg|ˈ|l|ʊ|d|v|ɪ|ɡ|_|v|æ|n|_|ˈ|b|eɪ|t|(|h|)|oʊ|v|ən}}; {{IPA-de|ˈluːtvɪç fan ˈbeːthoːfn̩|lang|De-Ludwig_van_Beethoven.ogg}}; baptised 17&nbsp;December 1770<ref name="birth date?">Beethoven was [[baptism|baptised]] on 17&nbsp;December. His date of birth was often given as 16&nbsp;December and his family and associates celebrated his birthday on that date, and most scholars accept that he was born on 16 December; however there is no documentary record of his birth.</ref>{{spaced ndash}}26&nbsp;March 1827) was a German [[composer]] and [[pianist]]. A crucial figure in the transition between the [[Classical period (music)|Classical]] and [[Romantic music|Romantic]] eras in [[classical music]], he remains one of the most recognised and influential of all composers. His best-known compositions include 9 [[symphony|symphonies]]; 5 [[piano concerto]]s; 1 [[violin concerto]]; 32 [[piano sonata]]s; 16 [[string quartet]]s; a [[Mass (music)|mass]], the ''[[Missa solemnis (Beethoven)|Missa solemnis]]''; and an [[opera]], ''[[Fidelio]]''. His career as a composer is conventionally divided into early, middle, and late periods; the "early" period is typically seen to last until 1802, the "middle" period from 1802 to 1812, and the "late" period from 1812 to his death in 1827.

Beethoven was born in [[Bonn]], then the capital of the [[Electorate of Cologne]] and part of the [[Holy Roman Empire]]. He displayed his musical talents at an early age and was taught by his father [[Johann van Beethoven]] and composer and conductor [[Christian Gottlob Neefe]]. At the age of 21 he moved to [[Vienna]], where he began studying composition with [[Joseph Haydn]] and gained a reputation as a virtuoso pianist. He lived in Vienna until his death. By his late 20s his hearing began to deteriorate and by the last decade of his life he was almost completely deaf. In 1811 he gave up conducting and performing in public but continued to compose; many of his most admired works come from these last 15 years of his life, commonly known as his "late" period.

==Biography==
===Background and early life===
[[File:Beethoven house of birth Bonn 2008.jpg|thumb|upright|Beethoven's birthplace at {{lang|de|Bonngasse&nbsp;20}}, now the [[Beethoven House]] museum]]
Beethoven was the grandson of [[Ludwig van Beethoven (1712–1773)|Ludwig van Beethoven]] (1712–1773), a musician from the town of [[Mechelen]] in the Austrian [[Duchy of Brabant]] (in what is now the [[Flemish region]] of Belgium) who had moved to [[Bonn]] the age of 21.{{sfn|GroveOnline|loc=section 1}}{{sfn|Cooper|2008|p=407}} Ludwig was employed as a [[bass (voice type)|bass]] singer at the court of the [[Electorate of Cologne|Elector of Cologne]], eventually rising to become, in 1761, {{lang|de|[[Kapellmeister]]}} (music director) and thereafter the pre-eminent musician in Bonn. The portrait he commissioned of himself towards the end of his life remained displayed in his grandson's rooms as a talisman of his musical heritage.{{sfn|Swafford|2014|pp=12–17}} Ludwig had one son, [[Johann van Beethoven|Johann]] (1740–1792), who worked as a tenor in the same musical establishment and gave keyboard and [[violin]] lessons to supplement his income.{{sfn|GroveOnline|loc=section 1}} Johann married [[Maria Magdalena Keverich]] in 1767; she was the daughter of Johann Heinrich Keverich (1701–1751), who had been the head chef at the court of the [[Archbishopric of Trier]].{{sfn|Thayer|1921|p=49}}

Beethoven was born of this marriage in Bonn. There is no authentic record of the date of his birth; however, the registry of his baptism, in a [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] service at the Parish of St. Regius on 17&nbsp;December 1770, survives.<ref>{{Cite book|title= Chambers Biographical Dictionary |editor = Thorne, J.O. |editor2=Collocott, T.C.|year= 1986|publisher=W & R Chambers Ltd. |location= Edinburgh|isbn= 978-0-550-18022-3|page= 114 |title-link = Chambers Biographical Dictionary }}</ref> As children of that era were traditionally baptised the day after birth in the Catholic Rhine country, and it is known that Beethoven's family and his teacher [[Johann Georg Albrechtsberger|Johann Albrechtsberger]] celebrated his birthday on 16&nbsp;December, most scholars accept 16&nbsp;December 1770 as his date of birth.{{sfn|Thayer|1921|p=53}}{{sfn|Solomon|2000|loc= chapter 1}} Of the seven children born to Johann van Beethoven, only Ludwig, the second-born, and two younger brothers survived infancy. [[Kaspar Anton Karl van Beethoven|Kaspar Anton Karl]] was born on 8&nbsp;April 1774, and Nikolaus Johann, the youngest, was born on 2&nbsp;October 1776.<ref name="Stanley7">[[#Stanley|Stanley]], p. 7</ref>

Beethoven's first music teacher was his father. He later had other local teachers: the court [[organist]] Gilles van den Eeden (d. 1782), Tobias Friedrich Pfeiffer (a family friend, who provided keyboard tuition), and Franz Rovantini (a relative, who instructed him in playing the violin and [[viola]]).{{sfn|GroveOnline|loc=section 1}} From the outset his tuition regime, which began in his fifth year, was harsh and intensive, often reducing him to tears; with the involvement of the insomniac Pfeiffer there were irregular late-night sessions with the young Beethoven being dragged from his bed to the keyboard.{{sfn|Swafford|2014|pp=22, 32}} His musical talent was obvious at a young age. Johann, aware of [[Leopold Mozart]]'s successes in this area (with his son [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Wolfgang]] and daughter [[Maria Anna Mozart|Nannerl]]), attempted to promote his son as a [[child prodigy]], claiming that Beethoven was six (he was seven) on the posters for his first public performance in March 1778.{{sfn|Thayer|1921|p=59}}

===First published compositions===
Some time after 1779, Beethoven began his studies with his most important teacher in Bonn, [[Christian Gottlob Neefe]], who was appointed the Court's Organist in that year.{{sfn|Thayer|1921|p=67}} Neefe taught him composition, and by March 1783 had helped him write his first published composition: a set of keyboard variations ([[WoO]] 63).<ref name="Stanley7"/> Beethoven soon began working with Neefe as assistant organist, at first unpaid (1781), and then as a paid employee (1784) of the court chapel conducted by the Kapellmeister [[Andrea Luchesi]]. His [[Three Piano Sonatas, WoO 47 (Beethoven)|first three piano sonatas]], named "{{lang|de|[[Kurfürst]]}}" ("Elector") for their dedication to the Elector [[Maximilian Friedrich von Königsegg-Rothenfels|Maximilian Friedrich]] (1708–1784), were published in 1783. Maximilian Frederick noticed his talent early, and subsidised and encouraged the young man's musical studies.{{sfn|Thayer|1921|pp=71–74}}

[[File:Thirteen-year-old Beethoven.jpg|thumb|upright|left|A portrait of the 13-year-old Beethoven by an unknown Bonn master ({{circa|1783}})]]

Maximilian Frederick's successor as the Elector of Bonn was [[Archduke Maximilian Francis of Austria|Maximilian Francis]], the youngest son of Empress [[Maria Theresa]] of Austria, and he brought notable changes to Bonn. Echoing changes made in Vienna by his brother [[Joseph II of Austria|Joseph]], he introduced reforms based on [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment philosophy]], with increased support for education and the arts. The teenage Beethoven was almost certainly influenced by these changes. He may also have been influenced at this time by ideas prominent in [[freemasonry]], as Neefe and others around Beethoven were members of the local chapter of the [[Illuminati|Order of the Illuminati]].{{sfn|Cooper|2008|p=15}}

In December 1786, Beethoven travelled to Vienna, at his employer's expense, for the first time, apparently in the hope of studying with Mozart.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Haberl|first=Dieter|date=2006|title=Beethovens erste Reise nach Wien – Die Datierung seiner Schulreise zu W.A. Mozart|url=|journal=Neues Musikwissenschaftliches Jahrbuch|volume=14|pages=215–255|via=}}</ref> The details of [[Beethoven and Mozart|their relationship]] are uncertain, including whether they actually met.{{sfn|Cooper|2008|p= 23}} Having learned that his mother was ill, Beethoven returned quickly to Bonn in May 1787. His mother died shortly thereafter, and his father lapsed deeper into [[alcoholism]]. As a result, he became responsible for the care of his two younger brothers, and spent the next five years in Bonn.{{sfn|Cooper|2008|p= 24}}

He was introduced in these years to several people who became important in his life. Franz Wegeler, a young medical student, introduced him to the von Breuning family (one of whose daughters Wegeler eventually married). He often visited the von Breuning household, where he taught piano to some of the children. Here he encountered German and classical literature. The von Breuning family environment was less stressful than his own, which was increasingly dominated by his father's decline.{{sfn|Cooper|2008|p= 16}} He also came to the attention of [[Count Ferdinand Ernst Gabriel von Waldstein|Count Ferdinand von Waldstein]], who became a lifelong friend and financial supporter.{{sfn|Thayer|1921|p=102}}

In 1789 Beethoven obtained a legal order by which half of his father's salary was paid directly to him for support of the family.{{sfn|Thayer|1921|p=104}} He also contributed further to the family's income by playing [[viola]] in the court orchestra. This familiarised him with a variety of operas, including three by Mozart that were performed at court in this period. He also befriended [[Anton Reicha]], a [[flute|flautist]] and violinist of about his own age who was a nephew of the court orchestra's conductor, [[Josef Reicha]].{{sfn|Thayer|1921|pp=105–09}}

From 1790 to 1792, he composed a significant number of works (none were published at the time, and most are now listed as "WoO", [[WoO|works without opus number]]) that demonstrated his growing range and maturity. [[Musicologist]]s have identified a theme similar to those of his [[Symphony No. 3 (Beethoven)|Third Symphony]] in a set of variations written in 1791.{{sfn|Cooper|2008|pp= 35–41}} It was probably on Neefe's recommendation that Beethoven received his first commissions; the municipal leaders in Bonn had commissioned cantatas to mark the occasion of the death in 1790 of [[Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor|Franz Joseph II]] and the subsequent accession of [[Leopold II, Holy Roman Emperor|Leopold II]] as [[Holy Roman Emperor]].  The two ''Emperor Cantatas'' (WoO 87, WoO 88) he scored were never performed  at the time and they remained lost until the 1880s. But they were, according to [[Johannes Brahms|Brahms]], distinctively "Beethoven through and through" and as such prophetic of the tragic style which would mark his music as distinct from the classical tradition.<ref>Swafford (2016), pp. 107–11</ref>

He was probably first introduced to [[Joseph Haydn]] in late 1790, when the latter was travelling to London and stopped in Bonn around Christmas time.{{sfn|Cooper|2008|p= 35}} A year and a half later, they met in Bonn on Haydn's return trip from London to Vienna in July 1792, and it is likely that arrangements were made at that time for Beethoven to study with the old master.{{sfn|Cooper|2008|p= 41}}

===Establishing his career in Vienna===
With the Elector's help, he left Bonn for Vienna in November 1792, amid rumours of [[First Coalition|war spilling out of France]]; he learned shortly after his arrival that his father had died.{{sfn|Thayer|1921|p=124}}{{sfn|Thayer|1921|p=148}}{{sfn|Cooper|2008|p= 42}} Mozart had also recently died. Count Waldstein, in his farewell note to Beethoven, wrote: "Through uninterrupted diligence you will receive Mozart's spirit through Haydn's hands."{{sfn|Cooper|2008|p= 42}} Over the next few years, Beethoven responded to the widespread feeling that he was a successor to the recently deceased Mozart by studying that master's work and writing works with a distinctly Mozartean flavour.{{sfn|Cooper|2008|p= 43}}
[[File:Beethoven Riedel 1801.jpg|thumb|upright|Portrait of Beethoven as a young man by Carl Traugott Riedel (1769–1832)]]

He did not immediately set out to establish himself as a composer, but rather devoted himself to study and performance. Working under Haydn's direction,{{sfn|GroveOnline|loc=section 3}} he sought to master [[counterpoint]]. He also studied violin under [[Ignaz Schuppanzigh]].{{sfn|Cooper|2008|pp= 47, 54}} Early in this period, he also began receiving occasional instruction from [[Antonio Salieri]], primarily in Italian vocal composition style; this relationship persisted until at least 1802, and possibly as late as 1809.{{sfn|Thayer|1921|p=161}} With Haydn's departure for England in 1794, Beethoven was expected by the Elector to return home to Bonn. He chose instead to remain in Vienna, continuing his instruction in counterpoint with [[Johann Georg Albrechtsberger|Johann Albrechtsberger]] and other teachers. Although his stipend from the Elector expired, a number of Viennese noblemen had already recognised his ability and offered him financial support, among them [[Joseph Franz von Lobkowitz|Prince Joseph Franz Lobkowitz]], [[Karl Alois Johann-Nepomuk Vinzenz, Fürst Lichnowsky|Prince Karl Lichnowsky]], and Baron [[Gottfried van Swieten]].{{sfn|Cooper|2008|p= 53}}

By 1793, he had established a reputation as an improviser in the salons of the nobility, often playing the [[Prelude (music)|preludes]] and [[fugue]]s of [[Johann Sebastian Bach|J.S. Bach]]'s ''[[Well-Tempered Clavier]]''.<ref name="Cross59">[[#Cross|Cross (1953)]], p. 59</ref> His friend [[Nikolaus Simrock]] had begun publishing his compositions; the first are believed to be a set of variations (WoO 66).{{sfn|Cooper|2008|p= 46}} By 1793, he had established a reputation in Vienna as a piano virtuoso, but he apparently withheld works from publication so that their publication in 1795 would have greater impact.{{sfn|Cooper|2008|p= 53}} His first public performance in Vienna was in March 1795, a concert in which he first performed one of his [[piano concerto]]s. It is uncertain whether this was the [[Piano Concerto No. 1 (Beethoven)|First]] or [[Piano Concerto No. 2 (Beethoven)|Second]]. Documentary evidence is unclear, and both concertos were in a similar state of near-completion (neither was completed or published for several years).{{sfn|Cooper|2008|p= 59}}{{sfn|Lockwood|2005|p=144}} Shortly after this performance, he arranged for the publication of the first of his compositions to which he assigned an [[opus number]], the [[Piano Trios, Op. 1 (Beethoven)|three piano trios, Opus 1]]. These works were dedicated to his patron Prince Lichnowsky,{{sfn|Cooper|2008|p= 59}} and were a financial success; Beethoven's profits were nearly sufficient to cover his living expenses for a year.{{sfn|Cooper|2008|p= 56}}

===Musical maturation===
Beethoven composed his [[String Quartets Nos. 1–6, Op. 18 (Beethoven)|first six string quartets (Op. 18)]] between 1798 and 1800 (commissioned by, and dedicated to, Prince Lobkowitz). They were published in 1801. With premieres of his [[Symphony No. 1 (Beethoven)|First]] and [[Symphony No. 2 (Beethoven)|Second]] Symphonies in 1800 and 1803, he became regarded as one of the most important of a generation of young composers following Haydn and Mozart. He also continued to write in other forms, turning out widely known [[piano sonata]]s like the "[[Piano Sonata No. 8 (Beethoven)|Pathétique]]" sonata (Op. 13), which Cooper describes as "surpass[ing] any of his previous compositions, in strength of character, depth of emotion, level of originality, and ingenuity of motivic and tonal manipulation."{{sfn|Cooper|2008|p= 82}} He also completed his [[Septet (Beethoven)|Septet]] (Op. 20) in 1799, which was one of his most popular works during his lifetime.
[[File:Beethoven Hornemann.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Beethoven in 1803, painted by [[Christian Horneman]] ]]

For the premiere of his ''First Symphony'', he hired the [[Burgtheater]] on 2&nbsp;April 1800, and staged an extensive programme of music, including works by Haydn and Mozart, as well as his Septet, the First Symphony, and one of his piano concertos (the latter three works all then unpublished). The concert, which the ''[[Allgemeine musikalische Zeitung]]'' described as "the most interesting concert in a long time," was not without difficulties; among the criticisms was that "the players did not bother to pay any attention to the soloist."{{sfn|Cooper|2008|p= 90}}

Mozart and Haydn were undeniable influences. For example, Beethoven's [[Quintet for Piano and Winds (Beethoven)|quintet for piano and winds]] is said to bear a strong resemblance to [[Quintet for Piano and Winds (Mozart)|Mozart's work for the same configuration]], albeit with his own distinctive touches.{{sfn|Cooper|2008|p= 66}}
<!-- could do with referenced discussion of some other influences here: Bach? Clementi? -->
But his melodies, musical development, use of modulation and texture, and characterisation of emotion all set him apart from his influences, and heightened the impact some of his early works made when they were first published.{{sfn|Cooper|2008|p= 58}} By the end of 1800, Beethoven and his music were already much in demand from patrons and publishers.{{sfn|Cooper|2008|p= 97}}

In May 1799, he taught piano to the daughters of Hungarian Countess Anna Brunsvik. During this time, he fell in love with the younger daughter [[Josephine Brunsvik|Josephine]]<ref>See Beethoven's love letter, March/April 1805, in Schmidt-Görg 1957, pp. 12–14, where he referred to this time.</ref> who has therefore been identified as one of the more likely candidates for the addressee of his letter to the "[[Immortal Beloved]]" (in 1812). Shortly after these lessons, Josephine was married to Count Josef Deym. Beethoven was a regular visitor at their house, continuing to teach Josephine, and playing at parties and concerts. Her marriage was by all accounts happy (despite initial financial problems),<ref>There were (as mentioned in Goldschmidt 1977, p. 484), over 100 love letters between the newlyweds, indicating that a healthy erotic relationship was growing between the spouses. {{harvnb|Steblin|2009|p= 155, n. 41}} announced a forthcoming publication of these letters.</ref> and the couple had four children. Her relationship with Beethoven intensified after Deym died suddenly in 1804.{{sfn|Cooper|2008|p= 80}}

[[File:Beethoven 3.jpg|thumb|upright|Ludwig van Beethoven: detail of an [[Beethoven (Mähler, 1804–05)|1804–05 portrait]] by [[Joseph Willibrord Mähler]]. The [[Media:Beethoven-Mähler 1804 hires.jpg|complete painting]] depicts Beethoven with a [[lyre-guitar]].]]
He also had a few other students. From 1801 to 1805, he tutored [[Ferdinand Ries]], who went on to become a composer and later wrote ''Beethoven remembered'', a book about their encounters. The young [[Carl Czerny]] studied with Beethoven from 1801 to 1803. Czerny went on to become a renowned music teacher himself, instructing [[Franz Liszt]], and on 11 February 1812 gave the Vienna premiere of Beethoven's [[Piano Concerto No. 5 (Beethoven)|fifth piano concerto (the "Emperor")]].{{sfn|Thayer|1921|p=526|ps=&nbsp; Prior to this ''first'' performance, there were others based in earlier sketches, as early as 22 December 1808}}

His compositions between 1800 and 1802 were dominated by two large-scale orchestral works, although he continued to produce other important works such as the piano sonata [[Piano Sonata No. 14 (Beethoven)|Sonata quasi una fantasia]] known as the "Moonlight Sonata". In the spring of 1801 he completed ''[[The Creatures of Prometheus]]'', a [[ballet]]. The work received numerous performances in 1801 and 1802, and he rushed to publish a piano arrangement to capitalise on its early popularity.{{sfn|Cooper|2008|pp= 98–103}} In the spring of 1802 he completed the [[Symphony No. 2 (Beethoven)|Second Symphony]], intended for performance at a concert that was cancelled. The symphony received its premiere instead at a subscription concert in April 1803 at the [[Theater an der Wien]], where he had been appointed composer in residence. In addition to the Second Symphony, the concert also featured the First Symphony, the [[Piano Concerto No. 3 (Beethoven)|Third Piano Concerto]], and the [[oratorio]] ''[[Christ on the Mount of Olives (Beethoven)|Christ on the Mount of Olives]]''. Reviews were mixed, but the concert was a financial success; he was able to charge three times the cost of a typical concert ticket.{{sfn|Cooper|2008|pp= 112–27}}

His business dealings with publishers also began to improve in 1802 when his brother Kaspar, who had previously assisted him casually, began to assume a larger role in the management of his affairs. In addition to negotiating higher prices for recently composed works, Kaspar also began selling some of his earlier unpublished compositions, and encouraged him (against Beethoven's preference) to also make arrangements and transcriptions of his more popular works for other instrument combinations. Beethoven acceded to these requests, as he could not prevent publishers from hiring others to do similar arrangements of his works.{{sfn|Cooper|2008|pp= 112–15}}

===Loss of hearing===
Beethoven is reported to have dated his hearing loss from a fit he suffered in 1798 induced by a rage at the interruption of his work—having fallen over, he got up to find himself deaf. His hearing only ever partially recovered and, during its gradual decline, was impeded by a severe form of [[tinnitus]].{{sfn|Swafford|2014|pp=223–24}} As early as 1801, he wrote to friends describing his symptoms and the difficulties they caused in both professional and social settings (although it is likely some of his close friends were already aware of the problems).{{sfn|Cooper|2008|p= 108}}

The cause of his deafness is unknown, but has variously been attributed to [[typhus]], [[auto-immune disorder]]s (such as [[systemic lupus erythematosus]]), and even his habit of immersing his head in cold water to stay awake.<ref>[http://www.beethoven.ws/loss_of_hearing.html Loss of Hearing], Beethoven biography at beethoven.ws</ref> The explanation from his autopsy was that he had a "distended inner ear", which developed lesions over time.{{Citation needed|date=February 2016}}
[[Paget's disease of bone|Paget's disease]] is another possible cause of his deafness.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Oiseth|first=Stanley J|date=2015-10-27|title=Beethoven's autopsy revisited: A pathologist sounds a final note|journal=Journal of Medical Biography|language=en|volume=25|issue=3|pages=139–147|doi=10.1177/0967772015575883|pmid=26508624}}</ref>
[[File:Beethoven Mähler 1815.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Beethoven in 1815 portrait by [[Joseph Willibrord Mähler]]]]

On the advice of his doctor, he lived in the small Austrian town of [[Heiligenstadt, Vienna|Heiligenstadt]], just outside Vienna, from April to October 1802 in an attempt to come to terms with his condition. There he wrote his [[Heiligenstadt Testament]], a letter to his brothers which records his thoughts of suicide due to his growing deafness and records his resolution to continue living for and through his art.{{sfn|Cooper|2008|p= 120}} Over time, his hearing loss became profound: at the end of the premiere of his [[Symphony No. 9 (Beethoven)|Ninth Symphony]] in 1824, he had to be turned around to see the tumultuous applause of the audience because he could hear neither it nor the orchestra. His hearing loss did not prevent him from composing music, but it made playing at concerts—a lucrative source of income—increasingly difficult. After a failed attempt in 1811 to perform his own [[Piano Concerto No. 5 (Beethoven)|Piano Concerto No. 5 (the "Emperor")]], which was premiered by his student [[Carl Czerny]], he never performed in public again until he directed the premiere performance of the Ninth Symphony in 1824, which involved him giving cues to conductor [[Michael Umlauf]].<ref>{{Britannica|578114|Symphony No. 9 in D Minor, Op. 125}}</ref>

A large collection of his hearing aids, such as a special [[ear horn]], can be viewed at the [[Beethoven House]] Museum in Bonn, Germany. Despite his obvious distress, Czerny remarked that Beethoven could still hear speech and music normally until 1812.<ref>{{Cite journal |title=Of Ear Trumpets and a Resonance Plate: Early Hearing Aids and Beethoven's Hearing Perception |first=George Thomas |last=Ealy |journal=19th-Century Music |volume=17 |issue=3 |date=Spring 1994 |pages=262–73 |jstor=746569 |doi=10.1525/ncm.1994.17.3.02a00050}}</ref> Around 1814 however, by the age of 44, he was almost totally deaf, and when a group of visitors saw him play a loud arpeggio of thundering bass notes at his piano remarking, "Ist es nicht schön?" (Is it not beautiful?), they felt deep sympathy considering his courage and sense of humour (he lost the ability to hear higher frequencies first).{{sfn|Solomon|2000}}

As a result of Beethoven's hearing loss, his conversation books are an unusually rich written resource. Used primarily in the last ten or so years of his life, his friends wrote in these books so that he could know what they were saying, and he then responded either orally or in the book. The books contain discussions about music and other matters, and give insights into his thinking; they are a source for investigations into how he intended his music should be performed, and also his perception of his relationship to art. Out of a total of 400 conversation books, it has been suggested{{by whom|date=November 2017}} that 264 were destroyed (and others were altered) after his death by his secretary [[Anton Schindler]], who wished only an idealised biography of the composer to survive.{{sfn|Clive|2001|p=239}} However, [[Theodore Albrecht]] contests the verity of Schindler's destruction of a large number of conversation books.<ref>"In any case, it now becomes abundantly clear that Schindler never possessed as many as c. 400 conversation books, and that he never destroyed roughly five-eighths of that number." [[Theodore Albrecht]], "Anton Schindler as destroyer and forger of Beethoven's conversation books: A case for decriminalization", ''Music's Intellectual History'', [[RILM]] 2010, 168–81.</ref>

===Patronage===
[[File:Rudolf-habsburg-olmuetz.jpg|thumb|upright|Beethoven's patron, [[Archduke Rudolf of Austria (1788–1831)|Archduke Rudolph]]]]

While Beethoven earned income from publication of his works and from public performances, he also depended on the generosity of patrons for income, for whom he gave private performances and copies of works they commissioned for an exclusive period prior to their publication. Some of his early patrons, including Prince Lobkowitz and Prince Lichnowsky, gave him annual stipends in addition to commissioning works and purchasing published works.{{sfn|Cooper|2008|pp= 78–79}}

Perhaps his most important aristocratic patron was [[Archduke Rudolf of Austria (1788–1831)|Archduke Rudolph]], the youngest son of [[Leopold II, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Leopold II]], who in 1803 or 1804 began to study piano and composition with him. The cleric ([[Cardinal-Priest]]) and the composer became friends, and their meetings continued until 1824.{{sfn|Lockwood|2005|pp=300–01}} Beethoven dedicated 14 compositions to Rudolph, including the [[Piano Trio No. 7 (Beethoven)|Archduke Trio]] (1811) and ''[[Missa solemnis (Beethoven)|Missa solemnis]]'' (1823). Rudolph, in turn, dedicated one of his own compositions to Beethoven. The letters Beethoven wrote to Rudolph are today kept at the [[Gesellschaft der Musikfreunde]] in Vienna.<ref>Prevot, Dominique. [http://www.lvbeethoven.com/Bio/BiographyMusicPupils.html "Beethoven's Pupils], Ludwig van Beethoven's Website. Trans. Hannah Salter. Accessed 5 June 2014.</ref> Another patron was Count (later Prince) [[Andrey Kirillovich Razumovsky|Andreas Razumovsky]], for whom the [[String Quartets Nos. 7–9, Op. 59 – Rasumovsky (Beethoven)|String Quartets Nos. 7–9, Op. 59, ''Rasumovsky'']] were named.

In the autumn of 1808, after having been rejected for a position at the royal theatre, he received an offer from [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon]]'s brother [[Jérôme Bonaparte]], then king of [[Kingdom of Westphalia|Westphalia]], for a well-paid position as [[Kapellmeister]] at the court in [[Kassel|Cassel]]. To persuade him to stay in Vienna, the Archduke Rudolph, [[Ferdinand, 5th Prince Kinsky of Wchinitz and Tettau|Prince Kinsky]] and Prince Lobkowitz, after receiving representations from the composer's friends, pledged to pay him a pension of 4000 florins a year. Only Archduke Rudolph paid his share of the pension on the agreed date.{{sfn|Cooper|2008|p= 195}} Kinsky, immediately called to military duty, did not contribute and soon died after falling from his horse. Lobkowitz stopped paying in September 1811. No successors came forward to continue the patronage, and Beethoven relied mostly on selling composition rights and a small pension after 1815. The effects of these financial arrangements were undermined to some extent by [[Napoleonic Wars|war with France]], which caused significant inflation when the government printed money to fund its war efforts.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}

===Middle period===
[[File:Beethoven monument bonn muensterplatz 2008.jpg|upright|thumb|[[Beethoven Monument (Bonn)|Beethoven Monument]] in Bonn, Münsterplatz]]

Beethoven's middle period spanned from 1802 through 1812.<ref name=mprbirthday/>

His return to Vienna from Heiligenstadt was marked by a change in musical style, and is now designated as the start of his middle or "heroic" period. According to Carl Czerny, Beethoven said, "I am not satisfied with the work I have done so far. From now on I intend to take a new way."{{sfn|Cooper|2008|p= 131}} This "heroic" phase was characterised by a large number of original works composed on a grand scale.<ref>"Beethoven's Heroic Phase", ''[[The Musical Times]]'', CX (1969), pp. 139–41</ref> The first major work employing this new style was the [[Symphony No. 3 (Beethoven)|Third Symphony]] in E flat, known as the ''Eroica''. This work was longer and larger in scope than any previous symphony. When it premiered in early 1805 it received a mixed reception. Some listeners objected to its length or misunderstood its structure, while others viewed it as a masterpiece.{{sfn|Cooper|2008|p= 148}}

The "middle period" is sometimes associated with a "heroic" manner of composing,<ref name="Solomon1990">{{cite book|last=Solomon|first=Maynard|authorlink=Maynard Solomon|title=Beethoven essays|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=2ZH3v2_-4F4C|page=124}}|accessdate=4 August 2011|year=1990|publisher=Harvard University Press|isbn=978-0-674-06379-2|page=124}}</ref> but the use of the term "heroic" has become increasingly controversial in Beethoven scholarship. The term is more frequently used as an alternative name for the middle period.<ref name="Steinberg2006">{{cite book|last=Steinberg|first=Michael P.|title=Listening to reason: culture, subjectivity, and nineteenth-century music|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=Xj43LwnGAccC|page=59}}|accessdate=4 August 2011|year=2006|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=978-0-691-12616-6|pages=59–60}}</ref> The appropriateness of the term "heroic" to describe the whole middle period has been questioned as well: while some works, like the Third and Fifth Symphonies, are easy to describe as "heroic", many others, like his [[Symphony No. 6 (Beethoven)|Symphony No. 6, ''Pastoral'']], are not.<ref name="BurnhamSteinberg2000">{{cite book|last1=Burnham|first1=Scott G.|last2=Steinberg|first2=Michael P.|title=Beethoven and his world|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=iIAexj-DFqYC|page=39}}|accessdate=4 August 2011|year=2000|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=978-0-691-07073-5|pages=39–40}}</ref>

{{Listen|type=music|pos=right|filename=Ludwig van Beethoven - Symphonie 5 c-moll - 1. Allegro con brio.ogg|title=Symphony No. 5, Op. 67 (1st movement)|description=composed during Beethoven's middle period}}

Some of the middle period works extend the musical language he had inherited from Haydn and Mozart. The middle period work includes the Third through [[Symphony No. 8 (Beethoven)|Eighth]] Symphonies, the [[String Quartets Nos. 7–9, Op. 59 – Rasumovsky (Beethoven)|Rasumovsky]], [[String Quartet No. 10 (Beethoven)|''Harp'']] and [[String Quartet No. 11 (Beethoven)|''Serioso'']] string quartets, the ''[[Piano Sonata No. 21 (Beethoven)|Waldstein]]'' and ''[[Piano Sonata No. 23 (Beethoven)|Appassionata]]'' piano sonatas, ''Christ on the Mount of Olives'', the opera ''[[Fidelio]]'', the [[Violin Concerto (Beethoven)|Violin Concerto]], and many other compositions. A minor work, his 1815 [[Finale (music)|finale]] ''[[Es ist vollbracht]]'', reflected the heroic style in an exaggerated fashion.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.it/books?id=oWEYAQAAIAAJ&dq=es+ist+vollbracht+beethoven&focus=searchwithinvolume&q=es+ist+vollbracht|title=Invito all'ascolto di Ludwig van Beethoven|last=Guanti|first=Giovanni|date=1995|publisher=Mursia|isbn=978-88-425-1647-7|language=it}}, p. 174.</ref> 

During this time his income came from publishing his works, from performances of them, and from his patrons. His position at the Theater an der Wien was terminated when the theatre changed management in early 1804, and he was forced to move temporarily to the suburbs of Vienna with his friend Stephan von Breuning. This slowed work on ''Fidelio'', his largest work to date, for a time. It was delayed again by the Austrian [[censorship|censor]], and finally premiered in November 1805 to houses that were nearly empty because of the [[War of the Third Coalition|French occupation of the city]]. In addition to being a financial failure, this version of ''Fidelio'' was also a critical failure, and Beethoven began revising it.{{sfn|Cooper|2008|p= 150}}

In May 1809, when the attacking forces of [[Napoleon]] [[Battle of Wagram#Initial hostilities|bombarded Vienna]], according to Ferdinand Ries, Beethoven, very worried that the noise would destroy what remained of his hearing, hid in the basement of his brother's house, covering his ears with pillows.{{sfn|Cooper|2008|p= 185}}

The work of the middle period established Beethoven as a master. In a review from 1810, he was enshrined by [[E.T.A. Hoffmann]] as one of the three great "[[Romantic music|Romantic]]" composers, along with Haydn and Mozart; Hoffmann called his [[Symphony No. 5 (Beethoven)|Fifth Symphony]] "one of the most important works of the age."<ref>{{Cite book|title=E.T.A.

===Personal and family difficulties===
Beethoven's love life was hampered by class issues. In late 1801, he met a young countess, [[Giulietta Guicciardi|Julie ("Giulietta") Guicciardi]], through the Brunsvik family, at a time when he was giving regular piano lessons to [[Josephine Brunsvik]]. He mentions his love for Julie in a November 1801 letter to his boyhood friend, Franz Wegeler, but he could not consider marrying her, due to the class difference. He later dedicated his [[Piano Sonata No. 14 (Beethoven)|Sonata No. 14]], now commonly known as the ''Moonlight sonata'', to her.{{sfn|Steblin|2009}}

{{Listen|type=music|filename=FurElise.ogg|title=Für Elise|description=}}
His relationship with Josephine Brunsvik deepened after the death in 1804 of her aristocratic first husband, the Count Joseph Deym. He wrote Josephine 15 passionate love letters from late 1804 to around 1809/10. Although his feelings were obviously reciprocated, Josephine was forced by her family to withdraw from him in 1807. She cited her "duty" and the fact that she would have lost the custodianship of her aristocratic children had she married a commoner.{{sfn|Cooper|2008|pp= 146, 168}} After Josephine married Baron von Stackelberg in 1810, Beethoven may have proposed unsuccessfully to [[Therese Malfatti]], the supposed dedicatee of "[[Für Elise]]";{{sfn|Lorenz|2011}}{{sfn|Steblin|2014}} his status as a commoner may again have interfered with those plans.

In the spring of 1811 he became seriously ill, suffering headaches and high fever. On the advice of his doctor, he spent six weeks in the [[Bohemia]]n [[spa town]] of [[Teplice|Teplitz]]. The following winter, which was dominated by work on the Seventh symphony, he was again ill, and his doctor ordered him to spend the summer of 1812 at the spa Teplitz. It is certain that he was at Teplitz when he wrote a love letter to his "[[Immortal Beloved]]".{{sfn|Brandenburg|1996|p=582}} The identity of the intended recipient has long been a subject of debate; candidates include [[Giulietta Guicciardi|Julie Guicciardi]], [[Therese Malfatti]], [[Josephine Brunsvik]], [[Anna Maria Erdődy]] and [[Antonie Brentano]].

He visited his brother Johann at the end of October 1812. He wished to end Johann's cohabitation with Therese Obermayer, a woman who already had an illegitimate child. He was unable to convince Johann to end the relationship and appealed to the local civic and religious authorities. Johann and Therese married on 9&nbsp;November.{{sfn|Cooper|2008|p= 212}}

In early 1813 he apparently went through a difficult emotional period, and his compositional output dropped. His personal appearance degraded—it had generally been neat—as did his manners in public, especially when dining. He took care of his brother (who was suffering from tuberculosis) and his family, an expense that he claimed left him penniless.

[[File:Beethoven Letronne.jpg|thumb|upright|Beethoven in 1814; portrait by {{ill|Louis-René Letronne|fr}}]]
Beethoven was finally motivated to begin significant composition again in June 1813, when news arrived of the [[Battle of Vitoria|defeat of one of Napoleon's armies]] at [[Vitoria, Spain]], by a coalition of forces under the [[Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington|Duke of Wellington]]. This news stimulated him to write the battle symphony known as ''[[Wellington's Victory]]''. It was first performed on 8&nbsp;December, along with his Seventh Symphony, at a charity concert for victims of the war. The work was a popular hit, probably because of its programmatic style, which was entertaining and easy to understand. It received repeat performances at concerts he staged in January and February 1814. His renewed popularity led to demands for a revival of ''Fidelio'', which, in its third revised version, was also well received at its July opening. That summer he composed a piano sonata for the first time in five years (''[[Piano Sonata No. 27 (Beethoven)|No. 27, Opus 90]]''). This work was in a markedly more [[Romanticism|Romantic]] style than his earlier sonatas. He was also one of many composers who produced music in a patriotic vein to entertain the many heads of state and diplomats who came to the [[Congress of Vienna]] that began in November 1814. His output of songs included his only [[song cycle]], "[[An die ferne Geliebte]]," and the extraordinarily expressive second setting of the poem "An die Hoffnung" (Op. 94) in 1815. Compared to its first setting in 1805 (a gift for Josephine Brunsvik), it was "far more dramatic&nbsp;... The entire spirit is that of an operatic scena."{{sfn|Lockwood|2005|p=278}}

===Custody struggle and illness===
Between 1815 and 1817 Beethoven's output dropped again. He attributed part of this to a lengthy illness (he called it an "inflammatory fever") that he had for more than a year, starting in October 1816.{{sfn|Cooper|2008|p= 254}} Biographers have speculated on a variety of other reasons that also contributed to the decline, including the difficulties in the personal lives of his would-be paramours and the harsh censorship policies of the Austrian government. The illness and death of his brother Kaspar from [[tuberculosis]] may also have played a role.

[[File:Beethoven 7.jpg|thumb|upright|Beethoven in 1818 by {{ill|August Klöber|de|August von Kloeber}}]]
Kaspar had been ill for some time, and Beethoven spent a small fortune in 1815 on his care. After Kaspar died on 15&nbsp;November 1815, Beethoven immediately became embroiled in a protracted legal dispute with Kaspar's wife [[Johanna van Beethoven|Johanna]] over custody of their son {{ill|Karl van Beethoven (born 1806)|de|Karl van Beethoven|lt=Karl}}, then nine years old. Beethoven, who considered Johanna an unfit parent because of her morals (she had an illegitimate child by a different father before marrying Kaspar and had been convicted of theft) and financial management, had successfully applied to Kaspar to have himself named sole guardian of the boy. A late [[codicil (will)|codicil]] to Kaspar's will gave him and Johanna joint guardianship. While Beethoven was successful at having his nephew removed from her custody in February 1816, the case was not fully resolved until 1820, and he was frequently preoccupied by the demands of the litigation and seeing to the welfare of Karl, whom he first placed in a private school.

The Austrian court system had one court for the [[nobility]] and members of the [[Landtafel]], the [[Landrecht (medieval)|Landrechte]], and many other courts for commoners, among them the Civil Court of the Vienna Magistrate. Beethoven disguised the fact that the Dutch "[[Van (Dutch)|van]]" in his name did not denote nobility as does the German "[[von]]"<ref name="landrecht">On 18 December 1818, the Landrechte, the Austrian court for the nobility, handed over the whole matter of guardianship to the Vienna Magistrate, the court for commoners. "It&nbsp;... appears from the statement of Ludwig van Beethoven, as the accompanying copy of the court minutes of 11&nbsp;December of this year shows, that he is unable to prove nobility: hence the matter of guardianship is transferred to an honorable magistrate."</ref> and his case was tried in the Landrechte. Owing to his influence with the court, Beethoven felt assured of the favourable outcome of being awarded sole guardianship. While giving evidence to the Landrechte, however, he was unable to prove being of noble birth<ref name="landrecht"/> and as a consequence, on 18&nbsp;December 1818 the case was transferred to the Magistracy, where he lost sole guardianship.

He appealed and regained custody. Johanna's appeal to the Emperor was not successful: the Emperor "washed his hands of the matter". During the years of custody that followed, Beethoven attempted to ensure that Karl lived to the highest moral standards. Beethoven had an overbearing manner and frequently interfered in his nephew's life. Karl attempted suicide on 31&nbsp;July 1826 by shooting himself in the head. He survived and was brought to his mother's house, where he recuperated. He and Beethoven were reconciled, but Karl insisted on joining the army and last saw Beethoven in January 1827.<ref>{{cite web|title=Karl van Beethoven (1806–58) Beethoven's nephew |author=John Suchet|authorlink=John Suchet|accessdate=January 12, 2016|publisher=[[Classic FM (UK)|Classic FM]]|url=http://www.classicfm.com/composers/beethoven/guides/karl-van-beethoven-nephew/#L3gz13I4CD25MpEx.97}}</ref>

===Late works===

Beethoven's late period spanned from 1812 to his death in 1827.<ref name=mprbirthday>https://www.classicalmpr.org/story/2011/12/16/beethovens-birthday</ref> 

He began a renewed study of older music, including works by [[Johann Sebastian Bach]] and [[George Frideric Handel]], that were then being published in the first attempts at complete editions. He composed the overture ''[[The Consecration of the House (overture)|The Consecration of the House]]'', which was the first work to attempt to incorporate these influences. A new style emerged, now called his "late period". He returned to the keyboard to compose his first piano sonatas in almost a decade: the works of the late period include the last five piano sonatas and the ''[[Diabelli Variations]]'', the last two sonatas for cello and piano, the late string quartets (see below), and two works for very large forces: the ''[[Missa Solemnis (Beethoven)|Missa Solemnis]]'' and the [[Symphony No. 9 (Beethoven)|Ninth Symphony]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}

By early 1818 his health had improved, and his nephew moved in with him in January. On the downside, his hearing had deteriorated to the point that conversation became difficult, necessitating the use of conversation books. His household management had also improved somewhat; Nanette Streicher, who had assisted in his care during his illness, continued to provide some support, and he finally found a skilled cook.{{sfn|Cooper|2008|p= 260}} His musical output in 1818 was still somewhat reduced, but included song collections and the [[Piano Sonata No. 29 (Beethoven)|"Hammerklavier" Sonata]], as well as sketches for two symphonies that eventually coalesced into the epic Ninth. In 1819 he was again preoccupied by the legal processes around Karl, and began work on the ''[[Diabelli Variations]]'' and the ''Missa Solemnis''.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}

For the next few years he continued to work on the ''Missa'', composing piano sonatas and [[bagatelle (music)|bagatelles]] to satisfy the demands of publishers and the need for income, and completing the ''Diabelli Variations''. He was ill again for an extended time in 1821, and completed the ''Missa'' in 1823, three years after its original due date. He also opened discussions with his publishers over the possibility of producing a complete edition of his work, an idea that was arguably not fully realised until 1971.{{Citation needed|date=October 2011}} His brother Johann began to take a hand in his business affairs, much in the way Kaspar had earlier, locating older unpublished works to offer for publication and offering the ''Missa'' to multiple publishers with the goal of getting a higher price for it.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}

Two commissions in 1822 improved his financial prospects. The [[Philharmonic Society]] of London offered a commission for a symphony, and Prince [[Nikolay Borisovich Galitzin|Nikolas Golitsin]] of [[Saint Petersburg|St. Petersburg]] offered to pay Beethoven's price for three string quartets. The first of these commissions spurred him to finish the Ninth Symphony, which was first performed, along with the ''Missa Solemnis'', on 7&nbsp;May 1824, to great acclaim at the [[Kärntnertortheater]]. The ''Allgemeine musikalische Zeitung'' gushed, "inexhaustible genius had shown us a new world", and Carl Czerny wrote that his symphony "breathes such a fresh, lively, indeed youthful spirit&nbsp;... so much power, innovation, and beauty as ever [came] from the head of this original man, although he certainly sometimes led the old wigs to shake their heads." Unlike his more lucrative earlier concerts, this did not make him much money, as the expenses of mounting it were significantly higher.{{sfn|Cooper|2008|p=317}} A second concert on 24&nbsp;May, in which the producer guaranteed him a minimum fee, was poorly attended; nephew Karl noted that "many people [had] already gone into the country". It was Beethoven's last public concert.{{sfn|Cooper|2008|p= 318}}

[[File:Beethoven Waldmuller 1823.jpg|thumb|Beethoven in 1823 by [[Ferdinand Georg Waldmüller]]]]

Beethoven then turned to writing the string quartets for Golitsin. This series of quartets, known as the "[[Late String Quartets (Beethoven)|Late Quartets]]," went far beyond what musicians or audiences were ready for at that time. One musician{{who|date=December 2011}} commented that "we know there is something there, but we do not know what it is." Composer [[Louis Spohr]] called them "indecipherable, uncorrected horrors." Opinion has changed considerably from the time of their first bewildered reception: their forms and ideas inspired musicians and composers including [[Richard Wagner]] and [[Béla Bartók]], and continue to do so. Of the late quartets, Beethoven's favourite was the [[String Quartet No. 14 (Beethoven)|Fourteenth Quartet, op. 131]] in C{{music|#}} minor, which he rated as his most perfect single work.{{sfn|Morris|2010|p=213}} The last musical wish of [[Franz Schubert|Schubert]] was to hear the Op. 131 quartet, which he did on 14 November 1828, five days before his death.<ref name="Winter1994">{{cite book|last=Winter|first=Robert|title=The Beethoven quartet companion|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=RzlUIuq0rPIC|page=245}}|accessdate=4 August 2011|year=1994|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=978-0-520-20420-1|page=245}}</ref>

He wrote the last quartets amidst failing health. In April 1825 he was bedridden, and remained ill for about a month. The illness—or more precisely, his recovery from it—is remembered for having given rise to the deeply felt slow movement of the [[String Quartet No. 15 (Beethoven)|Fifteenth Quartet]], which he called "Holy song of thanks ('Heiliger Dankgesang') to the divinity, from one made well." He went on to complete the quartets now numbered [[String Quartet No. 13 (Beethoven)|Thirteenth]], [[String Quartet No. 14 (Beethoven)|Fourteenth]], and [[String Quartet No. 16 (Beethoven)|Sixteenth]]. The last work completed by Beethoven was the substitute final movement of the Thirteenth Quartet, which replaced the difficult ''[[Große Fuge]]''. Shortly thereafter, in December 1826, illness struck again, with episodes of vomiting and diarrhoea that nearly ended his life.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}

In 1825, his nine symphonies were performed in a cycle for the first time, by the [[Leipzig Gewandhaus Orchestra]] under [[Johann Philipp Christian Schulz]]. This was repeated in 1826.<ref>[http://www.instantencore.com/buzz/feed.aspx?FeedId=5000199&PageNum=45 Instant Encore]. Retrieved 4 August 2014</ref><ref>Tom Service.

Beethoven was bedridden for most of his remaining months, and many friends came to visit. He died on 26 March 1827 at the age of 56 during a thunderstorm. His friend [[Anselm Hüttenbrenner]], who was present at the time, said that there was a peal of thunder at the moment of death. An [[autopsy]] revealed significant [[liver]] damage, which may have been due to heavy alcohol consumption.{{sfn|Cooper|2008|pp= 318, 349}} It also revealed considerable dilation of the auditory and other related nerves.<ref>{{cite journal |first1=Edoardo |last1=Saccenti |first2=Age K |last2=Smilde |first3=Wim H M |last3=Saris |year=2011 |title=Beethoven's deafness and his three styles |journal=BMJ |pmid=22187391 |doi=10.1136/bmj.d7589 |volume=343 |pages=d7589}} See also correction: {{cite journal |doi=10.1136/bmj.e512 |title=Beethoven's deafness and his three styles |year=2012 |journal=BMJ |volume=344 |pages=e512}}</ref>

Beethoven's funeral procession on 29&nbsp;March 1827 was attended by an estimated 20,000 people. [[Franz Schubert]], who died the following year and was buried next to him, was one of the torchbearers. He was buried in a dedicated grave in the [[Währing]] cemetery, north-west of Vienna, after a requiem mass at the church of the Holy Trinity (Dreifaltigkeitskirche). His remains were [[exhume]]d for study in 1862, and moved in 1888 to Vienna's [[Zentralfriedhof]].{{sfn|Cooper|2008|pp= 318, 349}} In 2012, his crypt was checked to see if his teeth had been stolen during a series of grave robberies of other famous Viennese composers.<ref>{{cite web

Beethoven is acknowledged to be one of the giants of [[classical music]]. Together with [[Johann Sebastian Bach|Bach]] and [[Johannes Brahms]], he is referred to as one of the "[[three Bs|three ''B''s]]"  who epitomize that tradition. He was a pivotal figure in the transition from the 18th century musical [[Classical music era|classicism]] to 19th century [[Romantic music|romanticism]], and his influence on subsequent generations of composers was profound.{{sfn|GroveOnline}} His music features twice on the [[Voyager Golden Record]], a phonograph record containing a broad sample of the images, common sounds, languages, and music of Earth, sent into outer space with the two [[Voyager program|Voyager]] probes.<ref name="Golden Record Music List">{{cite web|url=http://voyager.jpl.nasa.gov/spacecraft/music.html |title=Golden Record Music List|accessdate= 26 July 2012|publisher=[[NASA]]}}</ref>

===Overview===
Beethoven composed in several musical genres and for a variety of instrument combinations. His works for [[symphony orchestra]] include nine [[Symphony|symphonies]] (of which the Ninth Symphony includes a chorus), and about a dozen pieces of "occasional" music. He wrote seven [[concerto|concerti]] for one or more soloists and orchestra, as well as four shorter works that include soloists accompanied by orchestra. His only [[opera]] is ''[[Fidelio]]''; other vocal works with orchestral accompaniment include two [[mass (music)|masses]] and a number of shorter works.

His large body of compositions for [[piano]] includes 32 [[piano sonata]]s and numerous shorter pieces, including arrangements of some of his other works. Works with piano accompaniment include 10 violin sonatas, 5 cello sonatas, and a sonata for [[French horn]], as well as numerous [[lieder]].

He also wrote a significant quantity of [[chamber music]]. In addition to 16 [[string quartet]]s, he wrote five works for [[string quintet]], seven for [[piano trio]], five for [[string trio]], and more than a dozen works for various combinations of [[wind instrument]]s.

===The three periods===
Beethoven's career as a composer is conventionally divided into early, middle, and late periods. The "early" period is typically seen to last until 1802, the "middle" period from 1802 to 1812, and the "late" period thereafter. This distinction was first introduced in 1828, just one year after  his death, and while often challenged and refined it remains a starting point to understand the development of Beethoven's work.{{sfn|GroveOnline|loc=section 11}}

Beethoven's early years in Bonn arguably represent a further, preliminary, period. His earliest known composition was from 1782, and a total of 40 pieces by him dating from 1792 or earlier are known today (though mainly from much later sources). Today his best-known works from before 1790 are three piano quartets and three piano sonatas, the quartets being closely modelled on Mozart's sonatas for piano and violin. From 1790–1802, his best music can be found in a cantata and a number of concert arias, and in some variations for solo piano, while his instrumental music (including movements of symphonies and a violin concerto, as well as various fragmentary chamber works) is conservative and uninspired.<ref>{{harvnb|GroveOnline|loc=section 12}}, quote: "...  a few rather colourless sonata movements... Less impressive, in these years, is the instrumental music in the sonata style. ... Where Beethoven departed from formula in these works he seems to have straggled helplessly, as in the violin concerto fragment. ... Beethoven at Bonn was a less interesting composer of works in the sonata style than of music in other genres ..."</ref>

The conventional "first period" begins after Beethoven's arrival in Vienna in 1792. In the first few years he seems to have composed less than he did at Bonn, and his Piano Trios, op.1 were not published until 1795. From this point onward, he had mastered the 'Viennese style' (best known today from [[Joseph Haydn|Haydn]] and [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]]) and was making the style his own. His works from 1795 to 1800 are larger in scale than was the norm (writing sonatas in four movements, not three, for instance); typically he uses a [[scherzo]] rather than a [[minuet and trio]]; and his music often includes dramatic, even sometimes over-the-top, uses of extreme dynamics and tempi and chromatic harmony. It was this that led Haydn to believe the third trio of Op.1 was too difficult for an audience to appreciate.{{sfn|GroveOnline|loc=section 13}}

He also explored new directions and gradually expanded the scope and ambition of his work. Some important pieces from the early period are the [[Symphony No. 1 (Beethoven)|first]] and [[Symphony No. 2 (Beethoven)|second]] symphonies, the set of six string quartets [[String Quartets Nos. 1–6, Op. 18 (Beethoven)|Opus 18]], the first two piano concertos, and the first dozen or so [[Beethoven's piano sonatas|piano sonatas]], including the famous ''[[Piano Sonata No. 8 (Beethoven)|Pathétique]]'' sonata, Op. 13.

His middle (heroic) period began shortly after the personal crisis brought on by his recognition of encroaching deafness. It includes large-scale works that express heroism and struggle. Middle-period works include six symphonies (Nos. 3–8), the last two piano concertos, the [[Triple Concerto (Beethoven)|Triple Concerto]] and [[Violin Concerto (Beethoven)|violin concerto]], five string quartets (Nos. 7–11), several piano sonatas (including the ''[[Piano Sonata No. 21 (Beethoven)|Waldstein]]'' and ''[[Piano Sonata No. 23 (Beethoven)|Appassionata]]'' sonatas), the ''[[Violin Sonata No. 9 (Beethoven)|Kreutzer]]'' violin sonata and his only [[opera]], ''[[Fidelio]]''.

Beethoven's late period began around 1815. Works from this period are characterised by their intellectual depth, their formal innovations, and their intense, highly personal expression. The [[String Quartet No. 14 (Beethoven)|String Quartet, Op. 131]] has seven linked movements, and the [[Symphony No. 9 (Beethoven)|Ninth Symphony]] adds choral forces to the orchestra in the last movement.{{sfn|GroveOnline}} Other compositions from this period include the ''[[Missa solemnis (Beethoven)|Missa solemnis]]'', the last five string quartets (including the massive ''[[Große Fuge]]'') and the last five piano sonatas.

==Character==
[[File:Beethoven walk.jpg|thumb|Beethoven's walk in nature, by [[Julius Schmid (painter)|Julius Schmid]]]]
Beethoven's life was troubled by his encroaching loss of hearing and chronic abdominal pain since his twenties. He contemplated suicide as documented in his [[Heiligenstadt Testament]]. He was often irascible. Nevertheless, he had a close and devoted circle of friends all his life, thought to have been attracted by his strength of personality. Towards the end of his life, his friends competed in their efforts to help him cope with his incapacities.{{sfn|GroveOnline}}

Sources show his disdain for authority and for social rank. He stopped performing at the piano if the audience chatted amongst themselves, or afforded him less than their full attention. At soirées, he refused to perform if suddenly called upon to do so. Eventually, after many confrontations, the Archduke Rudolph decreed that the usual rules of court etiquette did not apply to Beethoven.{{sfn|GroveOnline}}

He was attracted to the ideals of the [[Age of Enlightenment]]. In 1804, when Napoleon's imperial ambitions became clear, Beethoven took hold of the title page of his [[Symphony No. 3 (Beethoven)|Third Symphony]] and scratched the name Bonaparte out so violently that he made a hole in the paper. He later changed the work's title to "Sinfonia Eroica, composta per festeggiare il sovvenire d'un grand'uom" ("Heroic Symphony, composed to celebrate the memory of a great man"), and he rededicated it to his patron, Prince [[Joseph Franz von Lobkowitz]], at whose palace it was first performed.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.beethoven.de/sixcms/detail.php?id=&template=dokseite_digitales_archiv_en&_dokid=bi:i3113&_seite=1|title=Friedrich Oelenhainz (1745–1804), Franz Joseph Maximilian Fürst von Lobkowitz (1772–1816)]|website=[[Beethoven-Haus]] Bonn|accessdate=6 October 2018|date=April 2002}}</ref>

The fourth movement of his [[Symphony No. 9 (Beethoven)|Ninth Symphony]] features an elaborate choral setting of [[Friedrich Schiller|Schiller's]] Ode ''[[Ode to Joy|An die Freude]]'' ("Ode to Joy"), an optimistic hymn championing the brotherhood of humanity.

==Legacy==
The [[Beethoven Monument (Bonn)|Beethoven Monument]] in Bonn was unveiled in August 1845, in honour of his 75th anniversary. It was the first statue of a composer created in Germany, and the music festival that accompanied the unveiling was the impetus for the very hasty construction of the original [[Beethovenhalle]] in Bonn (it was designed and built within less than a month, on the urging of [[Franz Liszt]]). A statue to Mozart had been unveiled in [[Salzburg]], Austria in 1842. Vienna did not honour Beethoven with a statue until 1880.<ref>{{cite book|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=hYBAFG01FOsC|page=316}} |title=Alessandra Comini, The Changing Image of Beethoven: A Study in Mythmaking |date=2008 |accessdate=2012-09-20|isbn=978-0-86534-661-1|last1=Comini |first1=Alessandra }}</ref> His is the only name inscribed on one of the plaques that trim [[Symphony Hall, Boston]]; the others were left empty because it was felt that only Beethoven's popularity would endure.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bso.org/brands/symphony-hall/about-us/historyarchives/the-history-of-symphony-hall.aspx|title=The History of Symphony Hall|publisher=}}</ref>

There is a museum, the [[Beethoven House]], the place of his birth, in central Bonn. The same city has hosted a musical festival, the [[Beethovenfest]], since 1845. The festival was initially irregular but has been organised annually since 2007.

The [[Ira F. Brilliant Center for Beethoven Studies]] serves as a museum, research center, and host of lectures and performances devoted solely to this life and works.

The [[Beethoven (crater)|third largest crater]] on Mercury is named in his honour, as is the main-belt asteroid [[1815 Beethoven]].
