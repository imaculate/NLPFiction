[[File:John D. Rockefeller.jpg|thumb|right|[[John D.

Rockefeller was the richest person.</ref>]]

The '''list of the wealthiest historical figures''' gathers published estimates as to the ([[Real versus nominal value (economics)|inflation-adjusted]]) net-worth and fortunes of the wealthiest [[historical figure]]s in comparison. Due to problems arising from different definitions of wealth, ways of measuring it, various economic models throughout history, as well as multiple other reasons—this article discusses the wealthiest people in the following separate historical periods: [[Classical Antiquity|Antiquity]], [[Middle Ages]] and [[modern period]]. Accordingly—because of the previously mentioned difficulties—it is not possible to determine the single richest person in all of history.

For the [[modern period]], wealth can be measured more or less objectively via [[inflation adjustment]], e.g. comparing the [[Economy of the United States|nominal GDP of the United States]] of the respective periods, and then converting it into contemporary United States dollars. For the medieval and ancient history, comparison of wealth becomes more problematic, on one hand due to the inaccuracy or unreliability of records, on the other due to the difficulty of comparing a pre-industrial economy to a modern one, and especially in the presence of [[absolute monarchy]], where an entire kingdom or empire is considered the ruler's personal property.  The latter factor is also an issue in the early modern to modern period, e.g. Davidson (2015) lists [[Joseph Stalin]] among ''The 10 Richest People of All Time'' for his "complete control of a nation with 9.6% of global GDP".<ref name="time.com"/>

Excluding [[monarch]]s and [[autocracy|autocrats]], the wealthiest private individual in the [[history of capitalism]] is variously identified as [[Jakob Fugger]] (died 1525), of the early modern [[Fugger]] family of merchants and bankers,<ref name=Fugger>Daniel Eckert,[https://www.welt.de/wirtschaft/article155974825/So-wurde-Fugger-zum-reichsten-Menschen-der-Geschichte.html So wurde Jakob Fugger zum reichsten Menschen der Historie] ("This is how Jakob Fugger became the wealthiest person in history"), ''[[Die Welt]]'', 6 June 2016 {{de-icon}}. "Auf heutige Verhältnisse hochgerechnet läge das Vermögen des Bauernenkels bei unglaublichen 400 Milliarden Dollar (354 Milliarden Euro). In die Nähe dieses Wertes kamen nur die Rothschilds, die in ihrer Glanzzeit im 19. Jahrhundert die mächtigste Bankiersfamilie der Welt waren" ("Adjusted to current-day conditions, the net worth of the farmer's grandson would be close to astonishing 400 billion dollars (354 billion Euro). Only the Rothschild family, at their peak in the 19th century the most powerful family of bankers, came close to such a figure."</ref> and early 20th-century American entrepreneurs [[Andrew Carnegie]] (died 1919)<ref name=Carnegie>listed at 372 billion US$2014 by Jacob Davidson, [http://time.com/money/3977798/the-10-richest-people-of-all-time time.com The 10 Richest People of All Time], 30 July 2015: "Rockefeller gets all the press, but Andrew Carnegie may be the richest American of all time. The Scottish immigrant sold his company, U.S. Steel, to J.P. Morgan for $480 million in 1901. That sum equates to about slightly over 2.1% of U.S. GDP at the time, giving Carnegie economic power equivalent to $372 billion in 2014."</ref> and [[John D. Rockefeller]] (died 1937). Frequently, one of these few people is considered to be the richest person of all time, depending on source.

While the [[Rothschild family]] rose to the status of the [[List of wealthiest families|wealthiest family]] of bankers in the 19th century, their wealth was distributed among a number of family members, preventing them from appearing among the wealthiest individuals. The richest among the Rothschilds was the head of its English branch—[[Nathan Mayer Rothschild]]—the richest person of his time.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=t7pKCAAAQBAJ&pg=PA65&dq=nathan+meyer+rothschild+richest#v=onepage&q=nathan%20meyer%20rothschild%20richest&f=false GDP: A Brief but Affectionate History] p. 65</ref> Bernstein and Swan in ''All the Money in the World'' (2008) mention the top three [[List of richest Americans in history|richest Americans ever]]—all [[tycoons]] of the [[Gilded Age]]—respectively: John D. Rockefeller, Andrew Carnegie and [[Cornelius Vanderbilt]]; [[Henry Ford]] was ranked only 12th.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=MQ4KnsyVQh8C&printsec=frontcover&hl=pl&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q=rockefeller&f=false ''All the Money in the World''] (2008) by Bernstein and Swan, p. 17 "Introduction"</ref>

According to Close (2016), the [[List of female billionaires|wealthiest woman]] in the history of capitalism, excluding monarchs, was ''L'Oréal'' heiress [[Liliane Bettencourt]], whose net worth was at $40.7 billion in 2015.<ref name="Close">Kerry Close, [http://time.com/money/4153560/10-richest-women-all-time/ The 10 Richest Women of All Time], time.com, 1 February 2016. Bettencourt ranks at #6 in this list, after five ancient rulers and monarchs of the Middle Ages and early modern period.</ref> Including monarchs, he mentions [[Empress Wu]] for Antiquity, [[Isabella of Castile]] for Middle Ages, and [[Catherine the Great]] for modern history.<ref>Kerry Close, [http://time.com/money/4153560/10-richest-women-all-time/ The 10 Richest Women of All Time], time.com. Empress Wu ranks at #1 in this list, Catherine the Great at #3, and Isabella of Castile at #5.</ref>

==Early modern to modern period==
Listed individuals are thought to have had a net worth of at least the equivalent of 100 billion [[United States dollars]]. Therefore, it excludes figures such as [[Andrew W. Mellon]], [[Richard B. Mellon]], [[Stephen Van Rensselaer]], [[A.T. Stewart]], [[Heshen]], [[J.P. Morgan]], and others.

|[[Emperor of All Russia]] from 1894 to 1917. Estimates of the wealth of Nicholas II remain wildly speculative. As emperor, and an autocrat, the resources under Nicholas II's command were virtually incalculable. However, the vast majority of this was officially owned by the State as Crown property. From this, supplemented by an annuity from the Treasury, he derived an annual income of 24 million [[rouble]]s, from which he had to fund staff, the upkeep of imperial palaces and imperial theatres, annuities for the royal family, pensions, bequests, and other outgoings.<ref name="Massie, Robert K. 1967, p64">Massie, Robert K.

|Henry Ford was an American automotive engineer, entrepreneur, and founder of the [[Ford Motor Company]]. By designing the [[Model T Ford]] with mass production in mind and employing the assembly line method of rapid production, he was able to radically lower the base price of his automobiles and reach a wider market. As production increased, Ford further reduced prices and increased salaries to reduce worker turnover. This resulted in a rapid increase in output, with Ford production rising from roughly 18,000 cars in 1909 to over 1 million cars in 1920. Despite Ford stating that his focus was increasing Ford Motor Company's benefit to society and to its employees, even at one point [[Dodge v. Ford Motor Company|being sued by the Dodge brothers]] based on this premise, his company was massively profitable. His highest earnings were recorded at age 57 and he died at the age of 83 in 1947 at a net worth of US$188.1 billion (inflation-adjusted value in 2008 dollars).

|[[Marcus Licinius Crassus]]
| c. 115 BC – 53 BC
| Crassus inherited a fortune of 7 million [[sesterces]] after the death of his father in 87 BC. After several years of exile, Crassus was able to rebuild his family fortune by seizing the property of executed convicts for himself.<ref name="TrivLibCrassus">[[Wallechinsky, David]] & [[Irving Wallace]]. "[http://www.trivia-library.com/b/richest-people-in-history-marcus-licinus-crassus.htm Richest People in History Ancient Roman Crassus]". Trivia-Library. ''[[The People's Almanac]]''. 1975 – 1981. Web. 23 December 2009.</ref> Crassus also expanded his wealth by trading in slaves and by purchasing whole neighborhoods of Rome as they burned, for drastically less than market value. Crassus was known in Rome as ''Dives'', meaning "The Rich". It is believed that Crassus expanded his personal fortune to 170 million sesterces, while [[Pliny the Elder]] surmised his fortune to be valued even higher, at 200 million sesterces. This would place Crassus's net worth equal to the total annual budget of the Roman treasury.
Crassus has often been listed among the "wealthiest individuals in history", although depending on the estimate of the "adjusted value" of a Roman [[sesterce]], his net worth may also be placed in the range of US$200 million to US$20 billion.<ref name=Bernstein>
"Often named as the richest man ever, a more accurate conversion of sesterce would put his modern figure between $200 million and $20 billion." [[Peter L. Bernstein]].
