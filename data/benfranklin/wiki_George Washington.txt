'''George Washington''' (February 22, 1732{{efn|Old style: February 11, 1731}}{{efn|name="calendar"|Contemporaneous records used the Julian calendar and the [[New Year#Historical Christian new year dates|Annunciation Style]] of enumerating years, recording his birth as February 11, 1731. The British [[Calendar (New Style) Act 1750]], implemented in 1752, altered the official British dating method to the Gregorian calendar with the start of the year on January 1 (it had been March 25). These changes resulted in dates being moved forward 11 days, and an advance of one year for those between January 1 and March 25. For a further explanation, see [[Old Style and New Style dates]].{{sfn|Engber|2006}}}}&nbsp;– {{nowrap|December 14}}, 1799) was an American political leader, military general, statesman, and [[Founding Fathers of the United States|Founding Father]] who served as the first [[president of the United States]] (1789–1797). He commanded [[Patriot (American Revolution)|Patriot]] forces in the new nation's vital [[American Revolutionary War]] and led them to victory over the British. Washington also presided at the [[Constitutional Convention (United States)|Constitutional Convention]] of 1787, which established the new federal government. For his manifold leadership during the [[American Revolution]], he has been called the "[[Father of the Nation|Father of His Country]]".

Washington succeeded a prosperous family of slaveholding planters in [[Colony of Virginia|colonial Virginia]]. He had educational opportunities and launched a favourable career as a [[Surveying|land surveyor]]. He then became a leader of the [[Virginia militia]] in the [[French and Indian War]]. During the Revolutionary War he was a delegate to the [[Continental Congress]], was unanimously appointed [[Commanding General of the United States Army|commander-in-chief]] of the [[Continental Army|Army]], and led an allied campaign to victory at the [[Siege of Yorktown]] ending the conflict. Once victory was in hand in 1783, he resigned as commander-in-chief.

Washington was unanimously elected President by the [[United States Electoral College|Electoral College]] in the first two national elections. He promoted and oversaw implementation of a strong, well-financed national government, but remained impartial in the fierce rivalry between subordinates [[Thomas Jefferson]] and [[Alexander Hamilton]]. In the [[French Revolution]], Washington proclaimed a policy of neutrality while sanctioning the [[Jay Treaty]]. He set enduring precedents for the office of president, including the title "President of the United States". Washington's [[George Washington's Farewell Address|Farewell Address]] was widely regarded as one of the most influential statements on republicanism.

Washington customarily owned and traded African slaves, but became troubled with the institution, and freed them in his will. He was a member of the [[Church of England|Anglican Church]] and the [[Freemasonry|Freemasons]], and urged tolerance for all religions in his roles as general and President. Upon his death, he was eulogized as "first in war, first in peace, and first in the hearts of his countrymen."{{sfn|Ferling|2009|pp=3–4}} Washington has been memorialized by monuments, art, places, stamps, and currency, and he has been [[historical rankings of presidents of the United States|ranked by scholars]] among the four greatest American presidents.

{{Further|Ancestry of George Washington|British America}}

George Washington was born on February 22, 1732 at [[George Washington Birthplace National Monument|Popes Creek]] in [[Westmoreland County, Virginia|Westmoreland County]], [[Colony of Virginia|Virginia]].{{sfn|Chernow|2010|p=6}} He was the first child of [[Augustine Washington|Augustine]] and [[Mary Ball Washington]], Augustine's second wife .{{sfnm|Ferling|2002|1p=3|Chernow|2010|2pp=5–7}} Washington's paternal family’s origins were [[English people|English]] gentry of [[Sulgrave]].{{sfnm|Chernow|2010|1p=3–5|Brown|1976|2p=476}} His great-grandfather [[John Washington]] settled in Virginia in 1657, established Popes Creek tobbaco plantation, and accumulated land and slaves, as did his son [[Lawrence Washington (1659–1698)|Lawrence]], and his grandson Augustine. {{sfn|Chernow|2010|p=3–5}} Washington's father, Augustine, was a Justice of the Peace and a prominent public figure who had 10 children, 4 by his first marriage to Jane Butler, and 6 by Mary, including Washington.{{sfnm|Cooke|2002|1p=2|Hofstra|1998|2p=vii|Alden|1996|3pp=3–4|Wiencek|2003|4p=54|Fitzpatrick|1936|1pp=V19: 509–510|Chernow|2010|2pp=6–8|Ferling|2002|3p=3}}

Washington grew up in Virginia's [[Tidewater (region)|Tidewater region]].{{sfnm|Chernow|2010|1pp=6–7|Alden|1996|2pp=2, 26|Randall|1997|3p=17}} When he was three, the family moved from Popes Creek plantation to the [[Mount Vernon|Epsewasson]] plantation on the [[Potomac River]]. Three years later, they relocated to [[Ferry Farm]] near [[Fredericksburg, Virginia|Fredericksburg]].{{sfnm|Ferling|2002|1p=4|Chernow|2010|2pp=7–8}} This is said to be the setting of an anecdote of [[Mason Locke Weems|Parson Weems]],{{sfnm|Hughes|1926|1pp=1:24, 501|Grizzard|2002|2pp=45–47}} who averred that Augustine once asked George whether he had damaged a cherry tree, and the boy replied, "I cannot tell a lie; I cut it with my little hatchet."{{sfn|Novak|2007|p=8}}{{efn|Biographer [[Parson Weems]]' account of the incident was published in 1806 {{sfn|Weems|1918|p=22}} Weems' story has never been proven or disproven.{{sfnm|Levy|2013|1pp=6, 217|Weems|1918|2p=22}}}}

On April 12, 1743 Augustine died, leaving Washington under the care of his mother Mary.{{sfn|Chernow|2010|pp=8–10}} Washington inherited Ferry Farm and ten slaves, while his older half-brother [[Lawrence Washington (1718–1752)|Lawrence]] inherited Epsewasson and changed its name to Mount Vernon.{{sfn|Chernow|2010|pp=9–10}} Washington's planned study at England's [[Appleby Grammar School]] was scrapped.{{sfnm|Ferling|2002|1p=14|Chernow|2010|2pp=11–12}} For two to three years Washington received his formal education at the Fredericksburg school of [[Church of England|Anglican]] clergyman James Mayre. {{sfnm|Knott|2005|1pp=1–5|Ferling|2010|2pp=5–6|Ferling|2002|3p=14|Chernow|2010|4pp=11–12}}{{efn|Washington was taught mathematics, trigonometry, and surveying, by school master Henry Williams, and was talented in draftsmanship and map-making. By early adulthood Washington was writing with "considerable force" and "precision."{{sfn|Chernow|2010|pp=11-12}}}}

Washington was strongly influenced by his visits to his brother Lawrence at Mount Vernon, and [[Belvoir (plantation)|Belvoir]], [[William Fairfax]]'s slave plantation.{{sfnm|Cooke|2002|1p=2|Chernow|2010|2p=10|Ferling|2002|3p=14|Alden|1996|4pp=4–5, 73}} Washington desired to live the life of wealthy planter aristocracy. Fairfax observed promise in the young Washington and became his patron and surrogate father.{{sfn|Ferling|2002|p=14}} In 1748, Fairfax sent Washington with a [[surveying]] party to survey Fairfax's [[Shenandoah Valley|Shenandoah]] property. {{sfnm|Randall|1997|1p=36|Ferling|2002|2p=15|Chernow|2010|3p=19}} Washington, however, abandoned the party, after a month of hardship, and returned home.{{sfn|Ferling|2002|p=15}}

In 1749, Washington received a surveyor's license from the [[College of William & Mary]], and was appointed surveyor of [[Culpeper, Virginia|Culpeper]], Virginia, with Fairfax's influence.{{sfnm|Fitzpatrick|1936|1loc=v. 19, p. 510|Chernow|2010|2p=22}} He made numerous surveys of the Shenandoah Valley, primarily for Fairfax, and became accustomed to the wilderness. In October 1750, Washington had bought almost {{convert|1500|acre|ha|-2}} in the Shenandoah Valley, when he resigned his Culpeper commission. By 1752 he accumulated {{convert|2315|acre|ha}} in the Valley.{{sfn|Chernow|2010|p=23}}

In 1751, Washington made his only trip abroad with Lawrence to [[Barbados]], hoping the climate would be beneficial to his brother's tuberculosis.{{sfn|Chernow|2010|p=24}} During the trip, Washington contracted [[smallpox]] which immunized him but left his face slightly scarred.{{sfn|Flexner|1974|p=8}} Lawrence's health continued to decline and he died on July 26, 1752.{{sfnm|Freeman|1948|1p=1:264|Chernow|2010|2p=26}} Washington inherited his Mount Vernon estate in 1754 after the deaths of Lawrence's wife and daughter.{{sfnm|Freeman|1948|1pp=1:15–72|Chernow|2010|2p=26}}

== Early military career (1752–1758) ==
[[File:Major George Washington - 1754.tif|thumb|upright|left|Major Washington in 1754|alt=A Young Washington in military uniform and hat, with right hand inserted in front of shirt in traditional pose]]

Washington's brother Lawrence was an adjutant general at death, and this inspired Washington to pursue his own military career.{{sfnm|Freeman|1948|1p=1:268|Fitzpatrick|1936|2p=510}} He was initially trained in musters and drills; subsequently the lieutenant governor of Virginia, [[Robert Dinwiddie]], appointed him adjutant, first to the Southern district in December 1752 and later to the Northern and Eastern districts as well.{{sfnm|Chernow|2010|1p=31|Fitzpatrick|1936|loc=v. 19, p. 510}} In February 1753 Dindwiddie appointed Washington as district adjunct general at an annual salary of £100, then promoted him to major, functioning as the British military envoy to the French officials directing them to vacate the British claimed territory. Thirty years later Washington reflected "that so young and inexperienced a person should have been employed".{{sfnm|Randall|1997|1p=74|Chernow|2010|2pp=26–27, 31}}

The British government had ordered Dinwiddie to guard British territorial claims in the [[Ohio River]] basin, to secure trade activity with the Indians and settlers.{{sfn|Fitzpatrick|1936|loc=v. 19, p. 510}} In 1753 Dindwiddie dispatched Washington to make peace with the [[Iroquois Confederacy|Six Nations]], gain any intelligence they could offer, and to deliver a letter which requested French commander [[Jacques Legardeur de Saint-Pierre]] at [[Fort Le Boeuf]], to vacate the Ohio Valley, and offered him safe escort to [[Lake Erie]].{{sfnm|Freeman|1948|1pp=1:274–327|Chernow|2010|2p=33}} Washington and six frontiersmen reached the Ohio River that November, but the French had withdrawn. He met with Half-King [[Tanacharison]] and other Iroquois chiefs at [[Logstown]], secured their promise of support against the French, then continued to [[Venango, Pennsylvania|Venango]] to meet the French who refused the letter. Washington then reached Fort Le Boeuf, delivered the letter to the commander, and accepted his reply requesting that Dinwiddie send his demand to the Major General of New France in [[Quebec]].{{sfnm|Lengel|2005|1pp=23–24|Fitzpatrick|1936|2loc=19, pp. 510–511|Chernow|2010|3p=33}} By Dinwiddie's order, Washington's diary of the expedition was printed by [[William Hunter (publisher)|William Hunter]], giving Washington name recognition in Virginia and England;{{sfn|Fitzpatrick|1936|loc=v. 19, p. 511}} it also helped him obtain a commission to raise a company of men.{{sfnm|Grizzard|2002|1p=86|Lengel|2005|2p=xxiii}}

=== French and Indian War ===
{{main|French and Indian War|George Washington in the French and Indian War}}

In 1753, the French military advanced into the [[Ohio Country]], where both France and Britain sought to expel the Indians. Dinwiddie and Washington were among stockholders in Virginia's [[Ohio Company]], created for British settlement there in its landholdings. The land that joined the [[Monongahela River|Monongahela]] and [[Allegheny River|Allegheny]] rivers {{efn|the [[Forks of the Ohio]], and future site of [[Pittsburgh]]}} was prized by both nations. The competing stakes led to the [[French and Indian War]] (1754–62), beginning with a shot ordered by Washington, which also led to the [[Seven Years' War]] (1756–63).{{sfn|Alden|1996|pp=13–15}}

[[File:The Night Council At Fort Necessity from the Darlington Collection of Engraving- detail.jpg|thumb|upright=1.1|left|alt=Night scene depicting Washington at center, standing among officers and Indians, around a lamp, holding a war council|Lt. Col. Washington holding night council at Fort Necessity]]

On October 31, 1753, Governor Dinwiddie commissioned Washington lieutenant colonel in the newly formed [[Virginia Regiment]], to peaceably confront French forces at the [[Forks of the Ohio|Ohio forks]], or capture or kill those resisting British control of the region.{{sfn|Chernow|2010|pp=31–32}} By April 2 Washington set out with 150 men, with news the French had ejected colonial traders and begun construction of [[Fort Duquesne]]. Half-King Tanacharison discovered a detachment of French troops east of [[Uniontown, Pennsylvania]], led by [[Joseph Coulon de Jumonville]], so Washington built an entrenched camp at Great Meadows, called [[Fort Necessity National Battlefield|Fort Necessity]]. He then led his unit and [[Mingo]] (Iroquois) allies in an ambush against the French on May 28 in the brief [[Battle of Jumonville Glen]].{{sfn|Fitzpatrick|1936|loc=v. 19, p. 511}} Jumonville was killed, and most of his party taken prisoner or killed; Tanacharison therefore labeled Washington [[Town Destroyer|Conotocaurius]] ("Town Destroyer").{{sfnm|Lengel|2005|1pp=31–38|Anderson|2007|2pp=53–58|Misencik|2014|3p=131}}

In July 1754, the French responded by attacking the fort in the ten-hour [[Battle of Fort Necessity]], which ended in Washington's surrender. The drafted surrender document was translated to falsely state that Washington had specifically "assassinated" Jumonville; this became the pretext to blame him for starting a war.{{sfnm|Grizzard|2002|1pp=115–19|Lengel|2005|2p=44|Fitzpatrick|1936|loc=v. 19, p. 511}}  [[Joseph Ellis]] concludes the episode demonstrated Washington's bravery and initiative, as well as his inexperience and impetuosity.{{sfn|Ellis|2004|pp=17–18}} However, Washington was blamed for the defeat and was replaced by [[James Innes (North Carolina)|colonel James Innes]]. Upon his return to Virginia, Washington refused to accept a demotion to the rank of captain and resigned his commission.{{sfn|Ferling|2009|pp=25–27}} The outcome, and Washington's part in it, drew international attention—the French alleged that the assassinated Jumonville had merely been there to warn Washington about encroaching on French-claimed territory.{{sfnm|Ellis|2004|pp=17–18|Ellis|2004|1pp=17-18|2a1=Jones|2a2=Wahrman|2y=2002|2p=34|Leduc|1943|3p=195}} France and Great Britain then began to fight for control of Ohio Country by sending in troops and declaring war in 1756.{{sfn|Anderson|2007|pp=100–01}}

In 1755, the British Crown sent its largest [[Braddock Expedition|expedition]] to the colonies, led by General [[Edward Braddock]] and [[regular army|regulars]], to take Fort Duquesne and expel the French from the Ohio Country.{{sfnm|Fitzpatrick|1936|p=511|Alden|1996|pp=35–36}} Braddock offered Washington a  position on his staff, and he accepted.{{sfn|Fitzpatrick|1936|p=511}} Washington recommended that Braddock split the army into two divisions, with a primary column and a second, lightly equipped "flying column".{{sfnm|Alden|1996|1p=37|Ferling|2010|2pp=35–36}} During the march, Washington became severely ill and was left behind; he rejoined Braddock at Monongahela. The next day, the French and their Indian allies ambushed Braddock's divided forces, and Braddock was mortally wounded in the [[Battle of the Monongahela]].{{sfnm|Alden|1996|1p=37|Ferling|2010|2pp=35–36}} The British suffered devastating casualties and retreated with two-thirds killed or wounded, but Washington rallied his forces in an organized retreat while suffering from a fever and headache.{{sfn|Alden|1996|pp=37–46}} He had two horses shot from under him, and his hat and coat were bullet-pierced.{{sfn|Fitzpatrick|1936|p=511}} His conduct under fire redeemed his reputation among critics of his command in the Battle of Fort Necessity,{{sfn|Ferling|2009|pp=28–30}} but he was not included by the succeeding commander Colonel Thomas Dunbar in planning subsequent operations.{{sfn|Alden|1996|pp=37–46}}

In August 1755, Dinwiddie appointed Washington colonel and  commander-in-chief of the [[Virginia Regiment]], to defend {{convert|300|mi|km}} of frontier from Indian attacks, with only 300 men.{{sfn|Fitzpatrick|1936|pp=511–512}} There were 20 battles in 10 months.{{sfnm|Fitzpatrick|1936|1pp=511–512|Flexner|1965|2p=138|Fischer|2004|3pp=15–16|Ellis|2004|4p=38}} Washington was convinced that Braddock would have recommended him for a regular commission in the British Army had he survived, so he appealed to Braddock's successor [[John Campbell, 4th Earl of Loudoun|Lord Loudoun]].{{sfn|Chernow|2010|pp=72–73}} Loudoun refused the request but agreed to transfer responsibility for [[Fort Cumberland (Maryland)|Fort Cumberland]] from Virginia to [[Province of Maryland|Maryland]].{{sfn|Chernow|2010|pp=72–73}} Washington's command increased to a thousand soldiers; he emphasized discipline and training, and Virginia's frontier population suffered less than that of other colonies as a result, and was considered Washington's "only unqualified success" during this war.{{sfnm|Fischer|2004|1pp=15–16|Ellis|2004|2p=38}}

Starting in 1756, the North American conflict spread to Europe, known as the [[Seven Years' War]].{{sfn|Taylor|2016|pp=44-45}} Washington continued to advocate the capture of Fort Duquesne,{{sfn|Fitzpatrick|1936|p=512}} and the British crown sent Commanding General [[John Forbes (British Army officer)|John Forbes]], Colonel [[Thomas Gage]], and British regulars to take the post in 1758.{{sfn|Fitzpatrick|1936|p=512}} Washington was promoted to [[Brevet (military)|honorary brigadier general]] and his two regiments were ordered to cooperate.{{sfnm|Fitzpatrick|1936|1p=512|Chernow|2010|2p=87}} Washington commanded the First Virginia regiment and was assigned to Forbes functioning as a line officer.{{efn|The Second Virginia regiment was constituted and raised under Colonel William Byrd III; it also was placed under Forbes.{{sfn|Flexner|1965|pp=206–207}}}} A dispute over command arose but was finally settled when it was decided that colonial officers could only be commanded by their regular commanders, which was satisfactory to Washington, although he continued his effort for a regular commission. He was the only colonial officer among the British forces and was involved in only one battle during the campaign.{{sfnm|Flexner|1965|1p=194|Fitzpatrick|1936|2p=512}}

During the [[Forbes Expedition]], Washington's suggestion to employ Indian-style warfare was ignored.{{sfnm|Fitzpatrick|1936|2p=512|Chernow|2010|1p=87}} Washington disagreed with  Forbes' plan to cut an entirely new western road, starting in Pennsylvania, rather than improve on Braddock’s old road.{{sfn|Flexner|1965|pp=194, 206–207}} 

Pursuant to Forbes’ assault plan on the fort, Washington lead one of three brigades, was alerted to enemy reconnaissance in the area, and sent Colonel [[George Mercer (military officer)|George Mercer]] with several hundred Virginians to investigate. Gunshots were heard in the distance, Washington's unit responded, and friendly fire resulted when reinforcements arrived; minor casualties resulted.{{sfn|Chernow|2010|p=90}}

Washington became honorary brigadier general, leading a final 2,500-man assault. His army arrived November 25 to find Fort Duquesne abandoned and burned by the French.{{sfnm|Ferling|2009|1pp=41–42|Chernow|2010|2pp=90–91}} The British had won a strategic victory by gaining control of the [[Ohio Valley]], but Washington retired from his Virginia Regiment commission in December 1758 and returned to Mount Vernon. The French and Indian War was finally concluded by two treaties in 1763: [[Treaty of Paris (1763)|''North American Theater'']] and [[Treaty of Hubertusburg|''European Theater'']].{{sfn|Lengel|2005|pp=75–76, 81}} Although Washington did not obtain a regular commission in the British Army, he gained valued knowledge of British fighting tactics, "a lasting reservoir of self-confidence," leadership skills, and most of all, he became a believer of a strong central government.{{sfnm|Chernow|2010|1pp=92-93|Ferling|2002|2pp=32-33}} During this era, however, Washington also gained first hand experience of the destructive competition and infighting among shortsighted colonial politicians that would recur among Patriot governments in the American Revolution.{{sfn|Chernow|2010|p=93}}

At age 27, Washington married [[Martha Washington|Martha Dandridge Custis]], the 28-year-old wealthy widow of [[Daniel Parke Custis]]. Martha was intelligent and gracious, and experienced in managing a planter's estate, and they effected an agreeable marriage.{{sfnm|Ferling|2002|1pp=33–34|Wiencek|2003|2p=69}} They raised [[John Parke Custis]] and Martha Parke (Patsy) Custis, children from her previous marriage, and later their grandchildren [[Eleanor Parke Custis Lewis|Eleanor Parke Custis]] and [[George Washington Parke Custis]]. Washington's 1751 bout with smallpox is thought to have rendered him sterile, and they lamented they had no children together.{{sfnm|Chernow|2010|1#’p=103|Flexner|1974|2pp=42–43}} They moved to Mount Vernon, near [[Alexandria, Virginia|Alexandria]], where he took up life as a planter of tobacco and wheat and emerged as a political figure.{{sfnm|Chernow|2010|1pp=97–98|Fischer|2004|2p=14}}

The marriage gave Washington control over Martha's one-third [[dower]] interest in the {{convert|18000|acre|ha|-2|adj=on}} [[Daniel Parke Custis#Estate|Custis estate]], worth about £40,000 (equivalent to about $10 million in 2018), and he managed the remaining two-thirds for Martha's children; he also acquired 84 slaves through the marriage.

==American Revolution==
{{main|George Washington in the American Revolution}}

Washington played a central role before and during the [[American Revolution]]. A prideful man, Washington's disdain for the British military had began when he was humiliatingly passed over for promotion into the Regular Army. He was opposed to the continuing taxes imposed by the British Parliament on the Colonies, without [[Virtual representation|proper representation]].{{sfn|Chernow|2010|p=136}}  He and other colonists were also angered by a [[Royal Proclamation of 1763|Royal Proclamation in 1763]] banning American settlement west of the [[Allegheny Mountains]], and protecting the [[North American fur trade|British fur trade]].{{efn|Washington secretly instructed Captain [[William Crawford (soldier)|William Crawford]] of the Ohio Country to scout out forbidden lands in the 1760s, beyond the Kings' Royal Proclamation Line.{{sfn|Chernow|2010|p=148}}}}{{sfnm|Chernow|2010|1p=137|Taylor|2016|2p=61}} He believed the [[Stamp Act 1765|Stamp Act]] of 1765 was an "Act of Oppression", and celebrated with fellow colonists its repeal the following year.{{efn|In a letter of September 20, 1765, Washington protested to "Robert Cary & Co." of the low prices that he received for his tobacco, and for the inflated prices that he was forced to pay on second-rate goods from [[London]].{{sfn|Chernow|2010|p=138}}}}{{sfn|Ferling|2009|p=68}} In March 1766, Parliament passed the [[Declaratory Act]], asserting that Parliamentary law superseded colonial law.{{sfn|Taylor|2016|p=103}} Washington helped to lead widespread protests against the [[Townshend Acts]] passed by Parliament in 1767, and he introduced a proposal in May 1769 drafted by [[George Mason]] that called for Virginia to boycott English goods until the Acts were repealed in 1770.{{sfnm|Freeman|1968|1pp=174–76|Taylor|2016|2p=75}}

Parliament sought to punish Massachusetts colonists for their role in the [[Boston Tea Party]] in 1774 with passage of the [[Intolerable Acts]], which Washington referred to as "an Invasion of our Rights and Privileges".{{sfnm|Randall|1997|1p=262|Chernow|2010|2p=166}} He said that Americans must not submit to acts of tyranny since "custom and use shall make us as tame and abject slaves, as the blacks we rule over with such arbitrary sway".{{sfn|Alden|1996|p=101}} That July, George Mason and Washington drafted a list of resolutions for the [[Fairfax County, Virginia|Fairfax County]] committee, chaired by Washington, which adopted the [[Fairfax Resolves]], calling for a Continental Congress.{{sfn|Chernow|2010|p=167}} On August 1, he attended the [[Virginia Conventions|First Virginia Convention]] where he was selected as a delegate to the [[First Continental Congress]].{{sfnm|1a1=Ferling|1y=2010|1p=100|2a1=Ford|2a2=Hunt|2a3=Fitzpatrick|2y=1904|2loc=v. 19, p. 11}}

===Commander in chief===

The [[American Revolutionary War|Revolutionary War]] against Britain began in April 1775, with the [[Battles of Lexington and Concord]], and a Patriot [[Siege of Boston|siege of the British]] in [[Boston]], and the [[Second Continental Congress]] officially created the [[Continental Army]] the next month. [[Samuel Adams]] and [[John Adams]] passed over [[John Hancock]] in nominating Washington as commander in chief, and he was unanimously elected the next day.{{sfnm|Taylor|2016|pp=132–133}|Ellis|2004|1pp=67–68|Chernow|2010|2p=185–186|Fitzpatrick|1936|3p=514}} Washington was considered an incisive leader who kept his "ambition in check."{{sfn|Chernow|2010|pp=185, 547}} 

Washington appeared before Congress in uniform and gave an acceptance speech, declining a salary, though he was later reimbursed expenses.{{sfnm|1a1=Rasmussen|1a2=Tilton|1y=1999|1p=294|2a1=Fitzpatrick|2y=1936|2p=514|Taylor|2016|3pp=141–142|Ferling|2009|4pp=86–87}} The Congress chose his primary officer staff, including Major General [[Artemas Ward]], Adjutant General [[Horatio Gates]], Major General [[Charles Lee (general)|Charles Lee]], Major General [[Philip Schuyler]], Major General [[Nathanael Greene]], Colonel [[Henry Knox]], and Colonel [[Alexander Hamilton]].{{sfnm|Chernow|2010|1pp=190–191|Ferling|2002|2p=108}} Washington was impressed by Colonel [[Benedict Arnold]] and gave him responsibility for invading Canada. He also engaged French and Indian War compatriot Brigadier General [[Daniel Morgan]]. Henry Knox, who also impressed Adams with ordnance knowledge, was promoted to colonel and chief of artillery by Washington.{{sfnm|Ferling|2002|1pp=109–110|Puls|2008|2p=31}}

Anticipating what awaited them, Washington and his party headed to Boston to engage the British for the first time. In the process he was becoming an embodiment of the revolution as he was greeted by local officials and statesmen along the way, some addressing him as "your excellency". Historian [[Garry Wills]] noted, "before there was a nation—before there was any symbol of that nation (a flag, a Constitution, a national seal)—there was Washington."{{sfn|Chernow|2010|p=193}}

On July 2, 1775, Washington inspected the new army at [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]], only to find soldiers who were undisciplined, badly outfitted and unsheltered.{{sfn|Taylor|2016|p=143}} He consulted with [[Benjamin Franklin]] and initiated his suggested reforms by drilling soldiers and imposing strict discipline, including fines, floggings, and incarceration.{{sfnm|Isaacson|2003|p=303|Ferling|2002|1p=112|Taylor|2016|2p=143|Fitzpatrick|1936|3p=514}} As ordered, his officer staff scrutinized military manuals and the individual skills of recruits to insure military effectiveness.{{sfn|Ferling|2002|pp=112–113}} He removed cowardly or incompetent officers, and demanded respect for civilians. All of this, he told Congress, was a "most necessary Work".{{sfn|Ferling|2002|p=116}} On August 23, King [[George III of the United Kingdom|George III]] proclaimed that rebellious American colonists were [[treason|traitors]] to [[the Crown]].{{sfn|Taylor|2016|p=144}}

=== Quebec, Boston, and Long Island ===
{{main|Invasion of Quebec (1775)|Siege of Boston|Battle of Long Island}}
[[File:WashingtonAtDorchesterHeightsByStuart.jpeg|thumb|upright|''Washington at Dorchester Heights'', [[Gilbert Stuart]] (1806) |alt=Painting of George Washington at Dorchester Heights, standing next to his white horse]]

In September 1775, Washington sent [[Benedict Arnold]] and 1,000 troops to British-held Quebec to support General [[Richard Montgomery]]'s siege and to secure the northern flank.{{sfn|Taylor|2016|pp=151–152}} The British outnumbered the American siege, which collapsed, forcing the Continental Army to make a hasty retreat.{{sfn|Taylor|2016|p=153}} Later that month Washington called a war council, proposing an attack on the besieged British Army in Boston, but his generals declined, to prevent high casualties in attacking an entrenched enemy.{{sfn|Ferling|2002|pp=117–118}} Fortunately, the British commander at Boston, General [[William Howe, 5th Viscount Howe|William Howe]], did not attack the burgeoning Continental Army.{{sfn|Ferling|2002|p=117}}

In late 1775, Washington sent staff officer [[Henry Knox]] to the [[Capture of Fort Ticonderoga|recently captured Fort Ticonderoga]] for gunpowder and cannons. By January, with expiring enlistments exceeding recruits, the army dropped to half, at 9,600 men, and was supplemented with previous war militia.{{sfnm|Taylor|2016|p=144|Ferling|2002|pp=116–117}}

In February 1776, Knox returned with the cannons, and per Washington's order they were [[Noble train of artillery|transported]] at night to [[Fortification of Dorchester Heights|Dorchester Heights]]. The next morning, Howe discovered Boston was under siege by Washington's army, and his fleet was vulnerable to Patriot cannon fire. Fearing high casualties from a direct assault, Howe opted to withdraw. Howe [[Evacuation Day (Massachusetts)|evacuated Boston]] with 10,000 troops and 1,100 [[Loyalism|Loyalists]], and the Patriots reclaimed the city. Washington then marched his army to [[Province of New York|New York]], initiated fortification, and correctly predicted that the British would return and attack in full force.{{sfnm|Lengel|2005|1pp=124–126|Higginbotham|1985|2pp=125–34|Ferling|2002|3p=118–119|Taylor|2016|4pp=153–154|Fitzpatrick|1936|5p=514}}{{efn|Congress initially attempted to direct the war effort in June 1776 with the committee known as "Board of War and Ordnance"; this was succeeded by the [[Board of War]] in July 1777, which eventually included members of the military.{{sfn|Freedman|2008|p=42}}}}

[[George Germain, 1st Viscount Sackville|George Germain]], Secretary for the American Colonies, who ran the British war effort from England, believed the war could be won with one "decisive blow."{{sfn|Chernow|2010|p=235}} The British forces included over 100 ships and thousands of troops.{{sfn|Fitzpatrick|1936|pp=514–515}} Howe's army landed unopposed on [[Staten Island]] on July 2 for a siege of the city as additional British ships and troops continued to arrive.{{sfn|Taylor|2016|pp=162–163}} The [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]] from Great Britain was adopted on July 4, 1776; on July 9, the [[Patriot (American Revolution)|Patriots]] toppled an equestrian statue of [[George III of the United Kingdom|King George III]] in New York City, melting it down to manufacture 40,000 bullets to shoot at British troops.{{sfn|Taylor|2016|p=160–161}} In his general orders, on July 9, Washington informed his troops that Congress had declared the united colonies were "free and independent states." {{sfn|Chernow|2010|p=237}}

Howe's troop strength totaled 32,000 regulars, including 8,000 [[Hessian (soldier)|Hessians]]; Washington's troop strength consisted of 23,000, 19,000 of whom were raw recruits and militia.{{sfnm|Chernow|2010|1pp=244–245|Taylor|2016|2pp=162–163}} On August 22, Howe landed 20,000 troops at [[Gravesend, Brooklyn]], and approached Washington's fortifications.

Howe was emboldened by his victory at Long Island and sent a dispatch addressed to "George Washington, Esq." attempting to negotiate peace. Washington declined the overture and demanded that he be addressed as a general and recognized as a fellow belligerent, not as a "rebel". He was concerned that his men would be hanged as rebels if they were captured, and he believed it his duty to insist that his men and the newly established United States be recognized with proper diplomatic protocol. The attempts at negotiation failed.{{sfnm|Chernow|2010|1p=240|Davis|1975|2pp=93–94|Taylor|2016|3p=164}}

The British navy bombarded unstable earthworks built by the Patriots on lower Manhattan Island.{{sfn|Taylor|2016|p=165}} Washington initially considered abandoning the island, including [[Fort Washington (New York)|Fort Washington]], but heeded the advice of Generals Greene and [[Israel Putnam]] to defend the fort.

Washington's army, reduced to 5,400 troops, retreated through [[Province of New Jersey|New Jersey]], as Howe broke off pursuit December 14, delayed his advance on Philadelphia, and set up winter quarters in New York.{{sfnm|Fischer|2004|1pp=224–226|Taylor|2016|pp=166–169}} Washington crossed the [[Delaware River]] into Pennsylvania, where Lee's replacement [[John Sullivan (general)|John Sullivan]] and 2,000 troops joined him.{{sfn|Taylor|2016|pp=166–167, 169}} The future of the Continental Army was in doubt for lack of supplies, a harsh winter, expiring enlistments, and desertions. Washington was disappointed that many New Jersey residents were Loyalists or skeptical about the prospect of independence.{{sfnm|Ketchum|1999|1p=235|Chernow|2010|2p=264}} Howe had split up his British Army and posted a [[Hessian (soldier)|Hessian]] garrison at [[Trenton, New Jersey|Trenton]], to hold western New Jersey and the east shore of the Delaware.{{sfn|Taylor|2016|p=169}}

Howe's army showed some complacency and Washington met with his generals on Christmas Eve to devise a surprise attack on the Hessian garrison at Trenton.{{sfn|Chernow|2010|pp=270–273}} [[Code name]]d "Victory or Death", the plan was for the army to make separate crossings of the Delaware in three divisions, one led by Washington (2,400 troops), another by General [[James Ewing (Pennsylvania)|James Ewing]] (700), and the third by Colonel [[John Cadwalader (general)|John Cadwalader]] (1,500), all reaching the Hessians at Trenton. Washington's force would then be split, with him taking the [[Pennington, New Jersey|Pennington]] Road, and General Sullivan traveling south on the river's edge.{{sfn|Chernow|2010|p=272}} Washington first ordered a 60-mile search for barges to transport his army,  particularly [[Durham boat]]s, and ordered the destruction of vessels that could be used by the British.{{sfnm|Chernow|2010|1pp=270–272|Randall|1997|2p=319}}

Washington initially crossed the Delaware at sunset Christmas Day and, risking capture, staked out the Jersey shoreline. His men followed across the ice-obstructed river in sleet and snow at [[McKonkey's Ferry]], with 40 men per vessel. Wind churned up the waters, and they were pelted with hail.{{sfn|Chernow|2010|p=273}} They made it across, without losing a man, at 3:00 {{small|A.M.}}. [[Henry Knox]] had been delayed, managing frightened horses and about 18 field guns on flat-bottomed ferries. Cadwalader and Ewing failed to cross due to the ice and heavy currents. While he awaited them, Washington grew doubtful of his planned attack on Trenton. Once Knox made it, Washington proceeded to Trenton an hour later.{{sfnm|Fischer|2004|2pp=215–219|Taylor|2016|1p=171}} Rather than return his army to Pennsylvania and risk being spotted, Washington chose to take his troops alone against the Hessians.{{sfn|Chernow|2010|pp=273–274}}

Hessian positions were spotted a mile from Trenton, so Washington, after consulting with his officers, split his force into two columns with words of encouragement to his men: "Soldiers keep by your officers. For God's sake, keep by your officers." The two columns were separated at the Birmingham crossroads, with General [[Nathanael Greene]]'s force, led by Washington, taking the upper Ferry Road, while General [[John Sullivan (general)|John Sullivan's]] advanced on River Road. ([[:File:Battle of Trenton.Dean.USMA.edu.history.gif|See map]].){{sfn|Fischer|2004|pp=228–230}} Veiled by sleet and snowfall, the Americans proceeded toward Trenton; many soldiers were shoeless, with bloodied feet, and two died of exposure.

Hessian Colonel [[Johann Rall]] was mortally wounded during the short battle.{{sfnm|Chernow|2010|1p=276|Ferling|2002|2pp=146–147|Fischer|2004|3pp=232–234, 405}}

The Hessians had 22 killed, 83 wounded, with 850 captured with many supplies. After retreating across the Delaware to Pennsylvania,{{sfn|Fischer|2004|p=254}} Washington returned to New Jersey on January 3, launching [[Battle of Princeton|an attack]] on British regulars at [[Princeton, New Jersey|Princeton]], with 40 Americans killed or wounded versus British losses of 273 killed or captured.{{sfnm|Ketchum|1999|1pp=306–307|Alden|1996|2p=146}} American Generals [[Hugh Mercer]] and John Cadwalader were being driven back by the British when Mercer was mortally wounded, then Washington arrived and led the men in a counterattack which advanced to within {{convert|30|yards|m}} of the British line.{{sfn|Alden|1996|p=145}}

The remaining British troops retreated after a brief stand, while others took refuge in [[Nassau Hall]]. Colonel [[Alexander Hamilton]] brought three cannons and began firing at the hall.

The British still controlled New York, and after the harsh winter campaign, many Patriot soldiers did not reenlist, or had deserted.

In July, 1777, British General [[John Burgoyne]] led the [[Saratoga campaign]] south from Quebec, through [[Lake Champlain]] and [[Siege of Fort Ticonderoga (1777)|recaptured Fort Ticonderoga]] with the objective of dividing [[New England]], including control of the [[Hudson River]].

Howe outmaneuvered Washington at the [[Battle of Brandywine]] on September 11, 1777, and marched unopposed into the nation's capital at Philadelphia. An October Patriot [[Battle of Germantown|attack]] on the British at [[Germantown, Philadelphia|Germantown]] failed. Because of the losses incurred at Philadelphia, Major General [[Thomas Conway]] prompted some members of Congress, referred to as the [[Conway Cabal]], to consider removing Washington from command.

During the [[Saratoga, New York|Saratoga]] campaign to the north, Washington was concerned with Howe's movements and also aware that Burgoyne was moving south toward Saratoga from Quebec. Washington took some risks to support Gates’ army, sending reinforcements north with Generals [[Benedict Arnold]], his most aggressive field commander, and [[Benjamin Lincoln]]. Burgoyne tried to take [[Battle of Bemis Heights|Bemis Heights]], but was isolated from support by Howe. He was forced to retreat to Saratoga and ultimately surrendered after the [[Battles of Saratoga]], leading to Howe's resignation in May 1778. As Washington suspected, Gates's victory emboldened his critics.{{sfn|Chernow|2010|pp=312–313}} 20th-century biographer John Alden maintains, "It was inevitable that the defeats of Washington's forces and the concurrent victory of the forces in upper New York should be compared." The admiration for Washington was waning, including little credit from John Adams.{{sfn|Alden|1996|p=163}}

This was a major turning point militarily and diplomatically; the French responded to Burgoyne's defeat by entering the war, allying with America and expanding the Revolutionary War into more than a domestic affair.{{sfnm|Chernow|2010|1p=312–314|Higginbotham|1971|loc=ch. 8}}

=== Valley Forge and Monmouth ===
{{Main|Valley Forge|Battle of Monmouth}}
[[File:Washington and Lafayette at Valley Forge.jpg|thumb|left|<center>Washington and Lafayette<br>Valley Forge</center> |alt=Painting showing Washington and Lafayette on horseback in a winter setting, at Valley Forge]]

Washington's army of 11,000 went into winter quarters at [[Valley Forge]] north of Philadelphia in December 1777. They suffered 2,000–3,000 deaths in extreme cold over six months, mostly from disease, lack of food, clothing, and shelter.{{sfnm|Ferling|2002|1pp=186|Alden|1996|2pp=165, 167|Freedman|2008|3p=30}} Meanwhile, the British were comfortably quartered in Philadelphia, paying for supplies in [[pound sterling|pounds sterling]], while Washington struggled with a devalued [[Continental currency|American paper currency]]. The woodlands were soon exhausted of game, and by February morale and increased desertions ensued.{{sfn|Alden|1996|p=165}}

Washington's repeated petitions to the Continental Congress for provisions were futile. He received a congressional delegation to check the Army's conditions, and expressed the urgency of the situation, proclaiming: "Something must be done. Important alterations must be made." He recommended that Congress expedite supplies and Congress agreed to strengthen and fund the army's supply lines by reorganizing the commissary department. By late February, there were adequate supplies arriving at the camp.{{sfn|Freedman|2008|p=42}}

[[File:BattleofMonmouth.jpg|thumb|''Washington Rallying the Troops at Monmouth'', [[Emanuel Leutze]] (1851–1854)]]

Baron [[Friedrich Wilhelm von Steuben]]’s incessant drilling soon transformed Washington’s recruits into a disciplined fighting force.{{sfnm|Randall|1997|1pp=342, 359|Ferling|2009|2p=172}} The revitalized army emerged from Valley Forge  early the following year.{{sfnm|Alden|1996|1p=168|Randall|1997|2pp=342, 356}} Von Steuben was promoted to Major General and became Washington's [[chief of staff]].{{sfn|Chernow|2010|p=336}}

In May 1778, the Continental Congress ratified a [[Treaty of Alliance (1778)|treaty]] with France, creating a pivotal military alliance.{{sfn|Taylor|2016|p=188}} The British evacuated Philadelphia for New York that June, and Washington summoned a war council of American and French Generals. He chose a partial attack on the retreating British at the [[Battle of Monmouth]]; the British were commanded by Howe's successor, General [[Henry Clinton (British Army officer, born 1730)|Henry Clinton]]. Generals [[Charles Lee (general)|Charles Lee]] and [[Gilbert du Motier, Marquis de Lafayette|Marquis de Lafayette]] moved with 4,000 men, without Washington's knowledge, and bungled their first attack on June 28. Washington relieved Lee and achieved a draw after an expansive battle. At nightfall, the British continued their retreat to New York, and Washington moved his army outside the city.{{sfnm|Alden|1996|1pp=176–77|Ferling|2002|2pp=195–198}} Monmouth was Washington’s last battle in the North; he prioritized the safety of his army over that of towns with little value to the British.{{sfn|Chernow|2010|p=344}}

=== West Point espionage ===
{{main|West Point|Military career of Benedict Arnold, 1777–79}}
Washington became "America's first [[espionage|spymaster]]", for his successful design of an espionage system against the British.{{sfn|Nagy|2016|p=274}} In 1778, Major [[Benjamin Tallmadge]] therefore formed the [[Culper Ring]], to covertly collect information about the British in New York.{{sfn|Rose|2006|p=75, 224, 258–61}} A vigilant Washington had disregarded incidents of disloyalty by [[Benedict Arnold]] who had distinguished himself in many battles.{{sfnm|Chernow|2010|1pp=378–387|Ward|1994}}

During mid-1780, Arnold began supplying British spymaster [[John André]] with sensitive information intended to compromise Washington and capture [[West Point, New York|West Point]], a key American defensive position on the [[Hudson River]].{{sfnm|Adams|1928|1pp=365–366|Philbrick|2016|2pp=250–251|Ward|1994}} Arnold repeatedly asked for command of West Point, and Washington finally agreed in August.{{sfnm|Chernow|2010|1pp=378, 380–381|Lengel|2005|2p=322|Adams|1928|3p=366|Philbrick|2016|4pp=280–282}} Arnold met André on September 21, giving him plans to take over the garrison. Arnold was variously motivated, by a £6,000 British payment, as well as his anger at being passed over and at personal Congressional slights.{{sfnm|Palmer|2010|1p=203|Flexner|1991|2pp=119–221|Rose|2006|3p=196|Taylor|2016|4p=206}} He was deeply in debt, [[war profiteering|profiteering]], and facing a [[court-martial]].{{sfnm|Adams|1928|1p=365|Palmer|2010|2pp=306, 315, 319, 320}}

Militia forces captured André and discovered the plans but Arnold escaped to New York.{{sfnm|Van Doren|1941|1pp=194–195|Adams|1928|2p=366|Palmer|2010|3p=410}} An outraged Washington recalled the commanders positioned under Arnold at key points around the fort to prevent this complicity, but did not suspect Arnold's wife [[Peggy Shippen]].{{sfnm|Palmer|2010|1p=370|Middlekauff|2015|2p=232}} Washington assumed personal command and reorganized West Point.{{sfn|Palmer|2010|p=371}}

André's trial for espionage ended in a death sentence, and Washington offered to return him to the British in exchange for Arnold, but [[Henry Clinton (British Army officer, born 1730)|Clinton]] refused. André was hanged on October 2, 1780 despite his request to face a firing squad, to deter other spies.{{sfnm|Flexner|1991|1p=386|Rose|2006|2p=212}}

=== Yorktown victory ===

In late 1778, General Clinton shipped 3,000 troops from New York to Georgia and launched a Southern invasion against [[Savannah, Georgia|Savannah]], reinforced by 2,000 British and Loyalist troops They repelled an attack by Patriots and French naval forces,  which bolstered the British war effort.{{sfn|Taylor|2016|p=230}}

In mid-1779, Washington attacked [[Iroquois]] warriors of the [[Iroquois Confederacy|Six Nations]] in order to force Britain's Indian allies out of New York, from which they had assaulted New England settlements.{{sfn|Grizzard|2002|p=303}} The Indian warriors joined with [[Tory]] rangers led by [[Walter Butler (Loyalist)|Walter Butler]] and viciously slew more than 200 frontiersmen in June, laying waste to the [[Wyoming Valley]] in Pennsylvania.{{sfn|Alden|1996|p=184}} In response, Washington ordered General John Sullivan to lead a [[Sullivan Expedition|expedition]] to effect "the total destruction and devastation" of Iroquois villages and take their women and children hostage. Those who managed to escape fled to Canada.{{sfn|Chernow|2010|p=360}} Sullivan's report of  mission accomplished referred to the Iroquois as "inhuman barbarians".{{sfn|Mann|2008|p=106}}

Washington's troops went into quarters at Morristown, New Jersey during the harsh winter of 1779—1780 and suffered their worst during the war, with temperatures well below freezing. [[New York Harbor]] was frozen over, snow and ice covered the ground for weeks, and the troops again lacked provisions.{{sfn|Mann|2008|p=108}}

Clinton assembled 12,500 troops and attacked [[Charleston, South Carolina|Charlestown]] (modern Charleston) in January 1780, defeating General [[Benjamin Lincoln]], who only had 5,100 Continental troops.{{sfn|Taylor|2016|p=234}} The British went on to occupy the [[South Carolina]] [[Piedmont (United States)|Piedmont]] in June, with no Patriot resistance.{{sfn|Taylor|2016|p=234}} Clinton returned to New York and left 8,000 troops commanded by Lord [[Charles Cornwallis, 1st Marquess Cornwallis|Charles Cornwallis]].{{sfn|Taylor|2016|pp=234–235}} Congress replaced Lincoln with Horatio Gates, who failed in South Carolina and was replaced by Washington's choice Greene; but the British had the South in their grasp. Washington was reinvigorated when upon learning in mid 1780 that Lafayette had returned from France with more ships, men, and supplies.{{sfn|Alden|1996|pp=187–188}}

In July 1780, 5,000 veteran French troops led by Marshal [[Jean-Baptiste Donatien de Vimeur, comte de Rochambeau|Rochambeau]], arrived at [[Newport, Rhode Island|New Port]], [[Rhode Island]].{{sfn|Lancaster|Plumb|1985|p=311}} French naval forces then landed, led by Admiral [[François Joseph Paul de Grasse|Grasse]], and Washington encouraged Rochambeau to move his fleet south to launch a joint land–naval attack on Arnold's troops.{{sfn|Alden|1996|p=197–199,206}}

Washington's army went into winter quarters at [[New Windsor, New York|New Windsor]], New York, in December 1780, where they again suffered and Washington urged Congress and state officials to expedite provisions. He sympathetically said he hoped the army would not "continue to struggle under the same difficulties they have hitherto endured".{{sfn|Alden|1996|p=193}} On March 1, 1781 Congress ratified the [[Articles of Confederation]], but the new government, that took effect on March 2, did not have the power to levy taxes, and loosely held the states together.{{sfn|Taylor|2016|p=339}}

General Clinton sent Arnold, now a British Brigadier General, to Virginia with 1,700 troops to capture [[Portsmouth, Virginia|Portsmouth]] and from there spread terror; Washington responded, sending Lafayette south to counter Arnold's efforts.{{sfn|Chernow|2010|p=403}} Washington initially hoped to bring the fight to New York, drawing off British forces from Virginia and ending the war there, but Rochambeau advised Grasse that [[Charles Cornwallis, 1st Marquess Cornwallis|Cornwallis]] in Virginia was the better target. Grasse's fleet arrived off the Virginia coast. Washington saw the advantage, and [[feint]]ed towards Clinton in New York before heading south to Virginia.{{sfnm|Alden|1996|1pp=198–99|Chernow|2010|2pp=403–404}}

After the French won a naval victory in the [[Battle of the Chesapeake]], Patriot forces trapped the British army in Virginia without reinforcement by Clinton from the North.{{sfnm|Alden|1996|1pp=198, 201|Chernow|2010|2pp=372–373, 418}} The [[siege of Yorktown|surrender at Yorktown]] on October 19, 1781 marked the end of major fighting.{{sfnm|1a1=Mann|1y=2008|1p=38|2a1=Lancaster|2a2=Plumb|2y=1985|2p=254|3a1=Chernow|3y=2010|3p=419}} Washington took great satisfaction but kept his taciturn composure.{{sfn|Middlekauff|2015|p=276}} Cornwallis, claiming illness, failed to appear at the ceremony of surrender, sending General [[Charles O'Hara]] as his proxy; Washington then had General Benjamin Lincoln accept the surrender.{{sfn|Alden|1996|pp=201–02}}

===Demobilization and resignation===

As peace negotiations started, the British gradually evacuated troops from Savannah, Charlestown, and New York by 1783, and the French army and navy likewise departed.{{sfn|Taylor|2016|pp=313–315}} The American treasury was empty, unpaid and mutinous soldiers forced adjournment of the Congress, and Washington dispelled unrest by suppressing the [[Newburgh Conspiracy]] in March 1783; Congress promised officers a five-year bonus.{{sfn|Kohn|1970|pp=187–220}} Washington submitted an account of $450,000 in expenses he advanced to the army (equivalent to $10 million in 2018). The account was settled, though it was allegedly vague about large sums, and included his wife Martha's expenses incurred through visits to his headquarters, as well as his agreed compensation.{{sfn|Alden|1996|p=209}}

Washington's resignation as Commander in Chief followed the [[Treaty of Paris (1783)|Treaty of Paris]], and he planned to retire to Mount Vernon. With the treaty ratified in April 1783, [[Alexander Hamilton|Hamilton]]’s Congressional committee adapted the army for peacetime. Washington learned of the treaty two months later,{{sfn|Chernow|2010|p=448}} and gave the Army's perspective to the Committee in his ''Sentiments on a Peace Establishment''.{{sfn|Washington|1783}} The Committee's proposals were defeated by Congress on three occasions.{{sfn|Wright|MacGregor|1987|p=27}} The Treaty was signed on September 3, 1783, and Great Britain officially recognized the independence of the United States. Washington disbanded his army, giving an eloquent farewell address to his soldiers on November 2.{{sfn|Washington|1799|p=343}} On November 25, the [[Evacuation Day (New York)|British evacuated New York City]], and Washington and Governor [[George Clinton (vice president)|George Clinton]] took possession. Only a few trusted delegates of the Continental Congress, including [[Thomas Jefferson]], knew of Washington's decision to [[George Washington's resignation as commander-in-chief|resign his commission]].{{sfn|Randall|1997|p=405}}

Washington advised Congress in August 1783 to keep a [[standing army]], create a "national [[militia]]" of separate state units, and establish a navy and a national military academy. He circulated his "Farewell" orders that discharged his troops, whom he called "one patriotic [[St Crispin's Day Speech|band of brothers]]". Before his return to Mount Vernon, he oversaw the evacuation of British forces in New York and was greeted by parades and celebrations, where he announced that Knox had been promoted commander-in-chief.{{sfnm|Chernow|2010|1p=446, 448–449, 451|Puls|2008|2pp=184–186}}

After leading the Continental Army for eight and a half years, Washington bade farewell to his officers at [[Fraunces Tavern]] in December 1783, and resigned his commission days later, refuting Loyalist claims he would not relinquish his military command.{{sfn|Taylor|2016|p=319}} In a final appearance in uniform, he gave a statement to the Congress: "I consider it an indispensable duty to close this last solemn act of my [[military|official]] life, by commending the interests of our dearest country to the protection of Almighty God, and those who have the superintendence of them, to his holy keeping."{{sfnm|Alden|1996|1p=210|Chernow|2010|2p=451–452, 455}} Washington's resignation was acclaimed at home and abroad and designed to show a skeptical world that the new republic would not degenerate into chaos.{{sfn|Chernow|2010|pp=454–455}}{{efn|While Jefferson denounced the Society of Cincinnati’s hereditary membership, he praised Washington for his "moderation and virtue" in relinquishing command.

=== Return to Mount Vernon ===
Shortly after his resignation Washington retired to Mount Vernon, longing for the "walks of private life...free from the bustle of a camp and the busy scenes of public life". In the months that followed, he came to realize, at age 52, that he was once again a common citizen now showing signs of age. In a letter to his close friend, Lafayette, he expressed this sentiment.{{sfnm|Randall|1997|1pp=408–410|Flexner|1974|2pp=180–182|Cooke|2002|3pp=2-}}

In 1784, Washington returned to the western frontier to inspect land holdings he had earned for his military service.{{sfn|Bell|1992|pp=52, 66}} He received a letter from Jefferson, urging him to renew his efforts as president of the [[Potomac Company]] to link the [[Potomac River]] to the [[Ohio River]] by canal, lest New York might dominate western trade with her own canal. Washington acceded, and promoted the project as a model for large-scale canal building, but the plan proved unprofitable, and the canal was not completed.{{sfnm|Ferling|2009|1pp=251–255|Flexner|1974|2p=196}}
[[file:Shays' Rebellion.jpg|right|thumb|180px|[[Shays' Rebellion]] confirmed for Washington the need to overhaul the Articles of Confederation.]]
Washington was convinced that the [[Articles of Confederation]], ratified earlier in 1781, was a weak foundation for the country, and a stronger government needed to be formed.{{sfnm|Cooke|2002|1pp=3-4|Chernow|2010|2p=518}} He believed the nation was on the verge of "anarchy and confusion," and that his retirement would be cut short.{{sfn|Cooke|2002|pp=3-4}} On August 29, 1786 [[Shays' Rebellion]] started in Massachusetts over taxation and property ownership, further convincing Washington that a national constitution was needed.{{sfn|Chernow|2010|pp=517-519}} On September 11, 1786, nationalists, who feared the new republic had descended into [[lawlessness]], met together at [[Annapolis Convention (1786)|Annapolis]] and requested that Congress revise the confederation.{{sfn|Taylor|2016|pp=373-374}} Congress agreed to a Constitutional Convention, to be held in the Spring of 1787 at Philadelphia. Each of the sovereign states were to choose delegates to attend the convention.{{sfn|Taylor|2016|pp=373-374}}

Washington had pledged to the several states not to reenter politics after the Revolutionary War, which had left him in debt with his plantations in bad need of repair. He also had various concerns about his health and an earlier declined obligation he made to the Cincinnatus Society.  On December 4, 1786 Washington was chosen to lead the Virginia delegation, but he hesitated, and eventually declined on December 21. After Washington consulted his friends [[Henry Knox]], [[James Madison]], and [[John Jay]], he was persuaded to attend the convention. {{sfn|Chernow|2010|pp=220-221}} On March 28, Washington told Governor Randolph he would attend the convention, but made it clear he did so involuntarily at the requests of his friends.{{sfnm|Ferling|2009|1p=266|Chernow|2010|2pp=218, 220-224, 520–526}}

Washington felt that a national Constitution was overdue, would unify the nation and bring closure to the Revolution.{{sfn|Ferling|2009|p=266}} To him, the [[Articles of Confederation]] were no more than "a rope of sand," linking the states of the nation, and sought a more centralized federal government.{{sfn|Alden|1996|p=221}} Regardless of the twelve state legislatures sending delegations for the publicly stated purpose of the Philadelphia Convention, some historians have determined that the populace electing them generally disagreed, fearing a strong central power would be just as overbearing as the British Parliament they had just forsaken.{{sfn|Ellis|2007|pp=91–92}}{{efn|At Founders Online, National Archives [https://founders.archives.gov/documents/Madison/01-09-02-0127 “List of State Acts Granting Congress Regulatory Powers”], From February to April 1787 under the Articles of Confederation, at least twelve of the thirteen states contemplated ceding Congress power to regulate commerce for 15-25 years: either 1) outright (RI) or 2) when “other States” agreed (MA, SC-GA - excepting slavery), 3) when “nine States” agreed (CT, NJ, PA, DE, MD, VA), or 4) only when “all the States” had given “similar powers” (NH,NC) — [NY, no record in the National Archives].}}

Washington lent his prestige to the goodwill and work of the other delegates. After a couple of months, he shared with [[Alexander Hamilton]] his anxiety over his sole unification of the delegates: "I almost despair of seeing a favorable issue to the proceedings of our convention and do therefore repent having had any agency in the business."{{sfnm|Alden|1996|1pp=226–27|Lodge|1889|2pp=34–35}} Following the Convention, he unsuccessfully lobbied many to support ratification of the [[United States Constitution|Constitution]], such as anti-federalist [[Patrick Henry]], to whom he said "the adoption of it under the present circumstances of the Union is in my opinion desirable", declaring the alternative would be [[anarchy]].{{sfn|Alden|1996|p=229}} Washington and Madison then spent four days at Mount Vernon evaluating the transition of the new government.{{sfn|Chernow|2010|pp=545–546}}

Washington wrote to James Madison: "As the first of everything in our situation will serve to establish a precedent, it is devoutly wished on my part that these precedents be fixed on true principles."{{sfn|Unger|2013|p=76}} To that end, he preferred the title "Mr. President" over more majestic names proposed by the Senate, including "His Excellency" and "His Highness the President".{{sfn|Bassett|1906|p=155}} His republican precedents also included the inaugural address, messages to Congress, and the [[Cabinet of the United States|cabinet form]] of the [[United States Executive Branch|executive branch]].{{sfn|Unger|2013|pp=236–37}}

Washington had planned to resign after his first term, but the political strife in the nation convinced him that he should remain in office.{{sfn|Chernow|2010|pp=674–675}} He was an able administrator, judge of talent and character, and talked regularly with department heads to get their advice.{{sfnm|Ellis|2004|1pp=197–98|Unger|2013|2pp=236–37}} He tolerated opposing views, despite fears that a democratic system would lead to political violence, and he conducted a smooth [[United States presidential transition|transition of power]] to his successor.{{sfnm|Genovese|2009|1p=589|Unger|2013|2pp=236–37}} Washington remained non-partisan throughout his presidency and opposed the divisiveness of political parties, but he favored a strong central government, was sympathetic to a Federalist form of government, and leery of the Republican opposition.{{sfnm|Chernow|2010|1pp=696–698|Randall|1997|2p=478}}

Washington dealt with major problems. The old [[Confederation Period|Confederation]] lacked the powers to handle its workload, had weak leadership, no executive, a small bureaucracy of clerks, a large debt, worthless paper money, and no power to establish taxes.{{sfn|Cooke|2002|p=5}} He had the task of assembling an executive department, and relied on [[Tobias Lear]] for advice selecting its officers.{{sfn|Chernow|2010|p=575}} Great Britain refused to relinquish its forts in the [[American West]],{{sfn|Cooke|2002|p=5}} and Barbary pirates preyed on American merchant ships in the Mediterranean while the U.S. Army was minuscule, and the Navy nonexistent.{{sfn|Chernow|2010|p=514}}

Congress created executive departments in 1789, including the [[United States Department of State|State Department]] in July, the [[United States Department of War|Department of War]] in August, and the [[United States Department of Treasury|Treasury Department]] in September. Washington appointed fellow Virginian [[Edmund Randolph]] as Attorney General, [[Samuel Osgood]] as Postmaster General, [[Thomas Jefferson]] as [[United States Secretary of State|Secretary of State]], and his commanding successor [[Henry Knox]] as [[United States Secretary of War|Secretary of War]]. Finally, he appointed [[Alexander Hamilton]] as [[United States Secretary of the Treasury|Secretary of the Treasury]].{{sfn|Cooke|2002|p=4}} Washington's cabinet became a consulting and advisory body, not mandated by the Constitution.{{sfn|Cooke|2002|pp=4–5}}

Washington's cabinet members formed rival parties with sharply opposing views, most fiercely illustrated between Hamilton and Jefferson.{{sfnm|Cooke|2002|1p=5|Banning|1974|2p=5}} He restricted cabinet discussions to topics of his choosing, without participating in debate. He occasionally requested cabinet opinions in writing, and expected department heads to agreeably carry out his decisions. Hamilton played an active, influential role advising Congress and its leaders.{{sfn|Cooke|2002|p=5}}

=== Domestic issues ===

Washington was apolitical and opposed the formation of parties, suspecting that conflict would undermine [[republicanism]].{{sfn|Elkins|McKitrick|1995|p=290}} His closest advisors formed two factions, portending the [[First Party System]]. Secretary of the Treasury [[Alexander Hamilton]] formed the [[Federalist Party]] to promote the national [[credit]] and a financially powerful nation. Secretary of State [[Thomas Jefferson]] opposed Hamilton's agenda, and founded the [[Democratic-Republican Party|Jeffersonian Republicans]]. Washington favored Hamilton's agenda, which went into effect and resulted in bitter controversy.{{sfn|Cooke|2002|p=7}}

Washington proclaimed November 26 as a day of [[Thanksgiving (United States)|Thanksgiving]], in order to encourage national unity saying, "It is the duty of all nations to acknowledge the providence of Almighty God, to obey His will, to be grateful for His benefits, and humbly to implore His protection and favor." On his appointed Thanksgiving Day (which later became an annual holiday), he [[fasting|fasted]] while visiting debtors in prison, but provided them with food and beer.{{sfnm|Chernow|2010|1pp=585, 609|Henriques|2006|2p=65|Novak|2007|3pp=144–146}}{{clear}}

====National Bank====
[[File:Philadelphia Presidents house.jpg|thumb|left|The President's House in Philadelphia was Washington's residence from 1790 to 1797 |alt=Engraving of President Washington's House in Philadelphia, his residence from 1790 to 1797]]
The establishment of public [[credit]] became a primary challenge for the federal government;{{sfn|Banning|1974|pp=5-7}} Hamilton submitted a report of the matter to a deadlocked Congress, and later he, Madison, and Jefferson reached the [[Compromise of 1790]] in which Jefferson agreed to Hamilton's debt proposals in exchange for moving the nation's capitol temporarily to Philadelphia and then south near [[Georgetown (Washington, D.C.)|Georgetown]] on the [[Potomac River]].{{sfn|Cooke|2002|p=7}} The terms were legislated in the [[Funding Act of 1790|Funding Act]] and the [[Residence Act]], both of which Washington signed into law. Congress authorized the assumption and payment of the nation's debts, with funding provided by [[customs duties in the United States|customs duties]] and [[excise tax in the United States|excise taxes]].{{sfn|Cooke|2002|pp=7–8}}

Hamilton created controversy among Cabinet members by advocating the establishment of the [[First Bank of the United States]]. Madison and Jefferson objected, but the bank easily passed Congress. Jefferson and [[Edmund Randolph|Randolph]] insisted the new bank was beyond the authority granted by the constitution, as Hamilton believed. Washington sided with Hamilton and signed the legislation on February 25; the rift between the latter and Jefferson became openly hostile.{{sfn|Cooke|2002|p=8}}

The nation’s [[Panic of 1792|first financial crisis]] occurred in March 1792. Hamilton's Federalists exploited large loans to gain control of U.S. debt securities, causing a [[bank run|run]] on the national bank;{{sfn|Sobel|1968|p=27}} the markets returned to normal by mid-April.{{sfnm|Banning|1974|1p=9|Sobel|1968|2p=30}} Jefferson believed Hamilton was part of the scheme, in spite of the latter's efforts to ameliorate, and Washington again found himself in the middle of a feud.{{sfn|Chernow|2010|pp=673–674}}

}}
Jefferson and Hamilton adopted diametrically opposed political principles. Hamilton believed in a strong national government requiring a national bank and foreign loans to function, while Jefferson believed the government should be primarily directed by the states and the farm element; he also resented the idea of banks and foreign loans. To Washington's dismay, persistent disputes and infighting between the two men ensued.{{sfnm|Chernow|2010|1pp=515, 627–630, 648–650|Randall|1997|2pp=452, 463, 468–471}} Hamilton demanded that Jefferson resign if he could not support Washington, and rather than respond publicly, Jefferson told Washington that Hamilton's fiscal system would lead to the overthrow of the Republic.{{sfnm|Banning|1974|1p=8|Cooke|2002|2p=9}}

Washington urged the two secretaries to call a truce for the nation’s sake, but they ignored him.{{sfnm|Cooke|2002|1p=9|Fitzpatrick|1936|2loc=v. 19, p. 523}} Washington reversed his decision to retire after his first term, to minimize party strife but the feud continued after his re-election.{{sfnm|Banning|1974|1p=8|Cooke|2002|2p=9}} Jefferson's political actions, his support of Freneau's ''National Gazette'',{{sfn|Elkins|McKitrick|1995|pp=240, 285, 290, 361}} and his attempt to undermine Hamilton nearly led Washington to dismiss him from the cabinet; Jefferson ultimately resigned his position in December 1793 and was thereafter forsaken by Washington.{{sfnm|Cooke|2002|1p=9|Chernow|2005|2p=427}}

The feud led to the well-defined Federalist and Republican parties, and party affiliation became necessary for election to Congress by 1794.{{sfn|Ferling|2013|pp=222, 283–284, 301–302}} Washington remained aloof from congressional attacks on Hamilton, but he did not publicly protect him. The [[Hamilton–Reynolds sex scandal]] opened Hamilton to disgrace, but Washington continued to hold him in "very high esteem" as the dominant force in establishing federal law and government.{{sfn|Ferling|2013|pp= 301–302}}

====Whiskey Rebellion====
In March 1791, Congress imposed an [[excise tax in the United States|excise tax]] on [[liquor|distilled spirits]] to help curtail the [[national debt of the United States|national debt]]; grain farmers strongly protested in Pennsylvania’s [[American frontier|frontier]] districts, saying they were unrepresented and shouldering too much of the debt, comparing their situation to the British taxation during the revolution. Washington, after appealing for peace, issued a proclamation on September 25 threatening the use of military force and reminding the protestors that, unlike the rule of the British crown, the Federal law was issued by state elected representatives.{{sfnm|Chernow|2010|1p=719|Puls|2008|2p=219}} Threats and violence against tax collectors escalated into defiance of federal authority in 1794 giving rise to the [[Whiskey Rebellion]]. The federal army wasn’t up to the task, so Washington invoked the [[Militia Act of 1792]] to summon state militias.{{sfn|Coakley|1996|pp=43–49}} Governors sent troops, with Washington taking command, then naming [[Henry Lee III|Light-Horse Harry Lee]] to lead the troops into the rebellious districts. The rebels dispersed, and there was no fighting.{{sfnm|Chernow|2010|1p=721|Kohn|1972|2pp=567–84}}

Washington's forceful action demonstrated that the government could protect itself and its tax collectors. This represented the first use of federal military force against the states and citizens,{{sfn|Kohn|1972|pp=567–84}} and remains the only time a sitting president has commanded troops in the field. Washington justified his action against "certain self-created societies" whom he regarded as "subversive organizations" that threatened the national union. He did not dispute their right to protest, but insisted their dissent not violate federal law. Congress agreed and extended their congratulations to him, with only Madison and Jefferson expressing indifference.{{sfn|Ellis|2004|p=225–226}}

===Foreign affairs===

In April 1792, the [[French Revolutionary Wars]] began between Great Britain and France, and Washington, with the cabinet's assent, declared America's neutrality. The revolutionary government of France sent diplomat [[Edmond-Charles Genêt|Citizen Genêt]] to America. He was welcomed with great enthusiasm and began promoting the case for France, using a network of new [[Democratic-Republican Societies]] in major cities. He even issued French [[letter of marque|letters of marque and reprisal]] to French ships manned by American sailors so that they could capture British merchant ships. Washington denounced the societies and demanded that the French recall Genêt.{{sfn|Elkins|McKitrick|1995|pp=335–54}}

Hamilton formulated the [[Jay Treaty]], to normalize trade relations with Great Britain while removing them from western forts, and also to resolve financial debts remaining from the Revolution.{{sfn|Elkins|McKitrick|1995|loc=ch. 9}}  [[Chief Justice of the United States|Chief Justice]] [[John Jay]], acting as Washington’s negotiator, signed the treaty on November 19, 1794; adamantly critical Jeffersonians supported France. Washington deliberated, then supported the treaty because it avoided war with Britain;{{sfn|Chernow|2010|p=730}} he was deeply disappointed that its provisions favored Great Britain.{{sfn|Ferling|2009|p=340}} After he mobilized public opinion and secured ratification in the Senate,{{sfnm|Estes|2000|1pp=393–422|Estes|2001|2pp=127–58}} Washington was subjected to severe and frequent public criticism.{{sfn|Ferling|2009|p=344}}

The British agreed to depart their forts around the [[Great Lakes]], and the United States–Canada boundary was subsequently modified. Numerous pre-Revolutionary debts were liquidated, and the British opened their [[British West Indies|West Indies colonies]] to American trade. The treaty secured peace with Britain and a decade of prosperous trade. Jefferson claimed it angered France and "invited rather than avoided" war.{{sfn|Ferling|2009|p=343}} Relations with France deteriorated afterwords, leaving succeeding president [[John Adams]] with prospective war.{{sfnm|Grizzard|2005|1p=263|Lengel|2005|2p=357}} When [[James Monroe]], American Minister to France, was recalled by Washington for his opposition to the Treaty, the French refused to accept his replacement, [[Charles Cotesworth Pinckney]] and two days before Washington's term ended, the French Directory declared the authority to seize American ships. {{sfn|Akers|2002|p=27}}

===Indian affairs===
[[File:Red Jacket 2.jpg|left|upright=0.8|thumb|Seneca Chief [[Sagoyewatha]] was Washington's peace emissary with the Indian Northwestern Confederation |alt=Portrait of Senaca Chief Sagoyewatha, Washington's peace emissary]]

An early issue for Washington was the British occupation in the northwest frontier and their [[Northwest Indian War|concerted efforts]] to turn incite Indians against settlers.{{sfnm|Fitzpatrick|1936|loc=v. 19, p. 523|Cooke|2002|pp=9-10}} The Northwest Indians allied with the British under [[Miami people|Miami]] chief [[Little Turtle]] to resist American expansion, and from 1783 to 1790 1,500 settlers were killed by the Indians.{{sfn|Waldman|Braun|2009|p=149}}

Washington decided Indian affairs would be "directed entirely by the great principles of Justice and humanity".{{sfn|Harless|2018}} He provided that their land interests be negotiated by treaties.{{sfn|Harless|2018}} The administration regarded powerful tribes as foreign nations, and Washington even smoked a [[ceremonial pipe|peace pipe]] and drank wine with them at the [[President's House (Philadelphia)|Philadelphia presidential house]].{{sfn|Calloway|2018|p=2}}

Washington made numerous attempts to conciliate the Indians;{{sfnm|Flexner|1969|1p=304|Taylor|2016|2p=406}} he equated the killing of Indians with that of Whites, and sought to integrate them into [[culture of the United States|American culture]].{{sfn|Cooke|2002|p=10}} Secretary of War [[Henry Knox]] attempted to encourage agriculture among the tribes.{{sfnm|Flexner|1969|1p=304|Taylor|2016|2p=406}}

In the Southwest, negotiations failed between federal commissioners and raiding Indian tribes seeking retribution. Washington invited [[Creek people|Creek]] Chief [[Alexander McGillivray]] and twenty-four leading chiefs to New York, to negotiate a treaty; he was treated as a foreign dignitary. On August 7, 1790 in [[Federal Hall]], Knox and McGillivray concluded the [[Treaty of New York (1790)|''Treaty of New York'']], which provided the tribes with agricultural supplies, and McGillivray with a rank of Brigadier General Army and an salary of $1,500.{{sfnm|Grizzard|2002|1pp=256-257|Puls|2008|2pp=207-208}}

[[File:Fallen timbers.jpg|thumb|right|alt=A R.F.

F. Zogbaum, 1896. The [[Ohio Country]] was ceded to America in its aftermath.]]

In 1790, Washington sent Brigadier General [[Josiah Harmar]] to pacify the Northwest Indians; Harmar was twice [[rout]]ed by Little Turtle and forced to withdraw.{{sfnm|Chernow|2010|1pp=667–678|Gaff|2004|2pp=xvii}}{{sfn|Waldman|Braun|2009|p=149}} The [[Western Confederacy]] of tribes used [[guerrilla warfare|guerrilla tactics]] and was an effective force against the sparsely manned American Army. Washington sent Major General [[Arthur St. Clair]] from [[Fort Washington (Cincinnati, Ohio)|Fort Washington]] on an expedition to restore peace in the territory in 1791. On November 4, St. Clair's forces were ambushed and soundly [[St. Clair's Defeat|defeated]] with few survivors, despite Washington's warning of surprise attacks. Washington was outraged over the Indians' brutality and execution of captives, including women and children.{{sfnm|Gaff|2004|1pp=3–6|Ferling|2009|2p=340}}

St. Clair resigned his commission, and Washington replaced him with Revolutionary War hero General [[Anthony Wayne]]. From 1792 to 1793, Wayne instructed his troops on Indian warfare tactics and instilled discipline lacking under St. Clair.{{sfnm|Cooke|2002|1p=10|Chernow|2010|2p=668}} In August 1794, Washington sent Wayne into the troubled Indian territory with
authority to drive them out by burning their villages and crops in the [[Maumee, Ohio|Maumee Valley]].{{sfnm|Taylor|2016|1p=406|Chernow|2010|2p=668}} On August 24, the American army under Wayne's leadership defeated the western confederacy at the [[Battle of Fallen Timbers]]. In August 1795, two-thirds of the [[Ohio Country]] was opened up for American settlement under the [[Treaty of Greenville]].{{sfnm|Cooke|2002|1p=14|Taylor|2016|2p=406}}

===Second term===
Approaching the [[United States presidential election, 1792|election of 1792]], Hamilton urged the popular Washington to run for a second term. Many took his silence on this topic as assent, viewing him as the only viable candidate. The [[United States Electoral College|Electoral College]] unanimously re-elected him President on February 13, 1793, and [[John Adams]] as Vice President by a vote of 77 to 50.{{sfn|Cooke|2002|p=10}}

After criticism over his birthday celebration and giving a "monarchist" impression, Washington arrived alone at [[Second inauguration of George Washington|his inauguration]] in a simple carriage. The inauguration was held in the Senate Chamber of [[Congress Hall]] in Philadelphia on Monday, March 4, 1793, and the oath of office was administered by Associate Justice [[William Cushing]]. This was the first inauguration to take place in the temporary capitol of Philadelphia. Washington aldo delivered the shortest inaugural address on record, at just 135 words, in four sentences.{{sfn|Chernow|2010|p=687}}

The feuding Jefferson and Hamilton agreed on one thing, that Washington remain in office for a second term. Differences of opinion centered around the French Revolution, with Washington remaining neutral, and over a national bank, which he strongly supported.{{sfn|Ferling|2009|pp=299, 304, 308–311}} This was known as the [[Federalist Era]].{{sfn|Banning|1974|p=2}}

In the final months of his presidency, Washington was assailed by his political foes and a [[partisan (politics)|partisan]] [[news media|press]] who accused him of being ambitious and greedy. He argued he had taken no salary during the  war and risked his life in battle; he regarded the press as a disuniting, "diabolical" force of falsehoods. This influenced his [[George Washington's Farewell Address|Farewell Address]], which related the troubling years of [[intragroup conflict|infighting]] and [[character assassination]] by much of the press.{{sfnm|Randall|1997|1pp=491–492|Chernow|2010|2pp=752–754}}

In 1793, Washington signed the [[Fugitive Slave Act]], allowing slave owners to cross state lines and retrieve runaway slaves.{{sfn|Chernow|2010|p=758}} He also signed the [[Slave Trade Act of 1794]], which limited American involvement in the [[Atlantic slave trade]].{{sfn|Bassett|1906|pp=187–189}} In 1794, he signed the [[Naval Act of 1794|Naval Act]] that created the [[United States Navy]] to combat [[Barbary pirates]] before the [[Barbary Wars]]. Washington appointed [[Oliver Wolcott, Jr.]], Secretary of the Treasury in 1795, replacing Hamilton, who resigned in the aftermath of the [[Whiskey Rebellion]]. The upshot of the Rebellion strengthened Washington's bond with Hamilton, distancing him from Knox who resigned.{{sfn|Chernow|2010|pp=726–727}}

At the end of his second term, Washington retired for personal and political reasons, fatigued and disgusted with personal attacks, and to assure a truly contested presidential election could be held. He did not feel bound to a two-term limit, but his retirement ultimately set precedent. The two-term limit to the presidency was formalized with the 1951 adoption of the [[Twenty-second Amendment to the United States Constitution]]. Washington is often credited with setting the principal of a two-term presidency, but it was Thomas Jefferson who first refused to run for a third term on political grounds.{{sfn|Korzi|2011|p=43}}{{sfn|Peabody|2001|pp=439-453}}

=== Farewell Address ===
{{Main|George Washington's Farewell Address}}
[[File:Washington's Farewell Address.jpg|thumb|[[George Washington's Farewell Address|Washington's Farewell Address]] (September 19, 1796) |alt=Newspaper showing Washington's Farewell Address]]

Washington planned to retire after his first term and in 1792 he had [[James Madison]] draft a farewell message with a given sentiment and theme; after his reelection, he and Madison finalized it.{{sfnm|Flexner|1972|1p=292|Chernow|2010|2pp=752–753}} The final version was published on September 19, 1796, by David Claypoole's ''[[Pennsylvania Packet|American Daily Advertiser]]'' and three other Philadelphia newspapers.{{sfn|Chernow|2010|p=754}} It warned against foreign alliances and their influence in domestic affairs, and against bitter [[partisan (politics)|partisanship]] in domestic politics. It also called for men to move beyond partisanship and serve the common good, stressing that the United States must concentrate on its own interests.{{sfn|Randall|1997|p=492}} He counseled friendship and commerce with all nations, but advised against involvement in European wars.{{sfnm|1a1=Fishman|1a2=Pederson|1a3=Rozell|1y=2001|1pp=119–120|2a1=Gregg|2a2=Spalding|2y=1999|2pp=199–216}} He stressed the importance of [[religion]], asserting that "religion and morality are indispensable supports" in a republic.{{sfn|Chernow|2010|p=133}}

Washington's address, influenced by Hamilton, only aggravated bipartisan politics, setting the tone for the coming 1796 election, which pitted Jefferson against Adams. Washington favored Federalist ideology, is said to have supported Adams, but without endorsement.{{sfnm|Randall|1997|1p=492|Cooke|2002|2pp=18-19}} On December 7, 1796, Washington read his eighth annual address to Congress. He spoke before the House, wore a black velvet suit, and donned his sword, and was well received by "the largest assemblage of citizens" in the crowded gallery. He advocated for a [[United States Military Academy|a military academy]], and celebrated the British departure from Northwest forts, and that [[Algiers]] had [[First Barbary War|released American prisoners]]—an event that would facilitate the [[United States Department of the Navy|Department of the Navy]].{{sfn|Chernow|2010|pp=764–765}} On February 8, 1797, Adams was elected President, and Jefferson Vice President.{{sfn|Akers|2002|p=25}}

Washington's Farewell Address proved to be one of the most influential statements on republicanism.{{sfn|Chernow|2010|pp=752–754}} It stressed the necessity and importance of national union, the value of the [[United States Constitution|Constitution]], the [[rule of law]], the evils of political parties, and the proper virtues of a republican people. He referred to [[morality]] as "a necessary spring of popular government", maintaining, "Whatever may be conceded to the influence of refined education on minds of peculiar structure, reason, and experience, both forbid us to expect that national morality can prevail in exclusion of [[morality and religion|religious principle]]."{{sfn|Boller|1963|p=47}}

Before its closing remarks, the address expressed this sentiment:

{{quote|"Though in reviewing the incidents of my Administration I am unconscious of intentional error, I am nevertheless too sensible of my defects not to think it probable that I may have committed many errors. Whatever they may be, I fervently beseech the Almighty to avert or mitigate the evils to which they may tend. I shall also carry with me the hope that my country will never cease to view them with indulgence, and that, after forty-five years of my life dedicated to its service with an upright zeal, the faults of incompetent abilities will be consigned to oblivion, as myself must soon be to the [[John 14|mansions of rest]]."{{sfn|Avlon|2017|p=280}}

Upon his retirement in March 1797 to Mount Vernon, Washington devoted time to his plantations and other business interests, including his [[:File:George Washington's Distillery.JPG|distillery]].{{sfn|Breen|White|2006|pp=209–20}} His plantation operations were only minimally profitable,{{sfn|Chernow|2010|p=53}} and his lands in the west ([[Piedmont (United States)|Piedmont]]), under Indian attacks, yielded little income, with the squatters there refusing to pay rent. He attempted to sell these off but without success.{{sfn|Ellis|2004|pp=255–61}} He became an even more committed Federalist, vocal in his support of the [[Alien and Sedition Acts]], convincing Federalist [[John Marshall]] to run for Congress to weaken the Jeffersonian hold on [[Virginia]].{{sfn|Flexner|1974|p=386}}

Washington grew restless in retirement, prompted by tensions with France, and wrote to Secretary of War [[James McHenry]] offering to organize President Adams' army.{{sfn|Randall|1997|p=497}} French privateers began seizing American ships in 1798, relations with France deteriorated and led to the "[[Quasi-War]]". Adams offered Washington a commission as lieutenant general on July 4, 1798, and as commander-in-chief of the armies. He accepted, replacing [[James Wilkinson]]{{sfn|Bell|1992|p=64}} and served as the commanding general from July 13, 1798, until his death 17 months later. He participated in planning for a provisional army but avoided involvement in details. In advising McHenry of potential officers for the army, he appeared to make a complete break with Jefferson's Democratic-Republicans, “...you could as soon scrub the blackamoor white, as to change the principles of a profest Democrat; and that he will leave nothing unattempted to overturn the government of this country.“{{sfn|Fitzpatrick|1936|loc=vol. 36|p=474}} Washington delegated the active leadership of the army to Hamilton as major general. No army invaded the United States during this period, and Washington did not assume a field command.{{sfnm|Kohn|1975|1pp=225–42|Grizzard|2005|2p=264}}

Washington was thought to be rich because of the well-known "glorified façade of wealth and grandeur" at Mount Vernon,{{sfn|Chernow|2010|p=708}} but nearly all of his wealth was in the form of land and slaves rather than ready cash. Historians estimate that the estate was worth about $1 million in 1799 dollars, equivalent to about $20 million in 2018.{{sfn|Dalzell|1998|p=219}} To spur development around the new [[Washington, D.C.|Federal City]], named in his honor, Washington bought land parcels. Rather than selling multiple lots to large investors, he sold individual lots to middle-income investors, believing they would more likely commit to making improvements.{{sfn|Chernow|2010|pp=704–705}}

===Final days and death===
[[File:Life of George Washington, Deathbed.jpg|left|thumb|alt=The scene of Washington on his deathbed with doctors and family surrounding.|''Washington on his Deathbed''<br>[[Junius Brutus Stearns]] 1799]]

On Thursday, December 12, 1799, Washington inspected his farms on horseback in snow and sleet and   was late for dinner, but refused to change out of his wet clothes, not wanting to keep his guests further waiting. He had a sore throat the following day but again went out in freezing, snowy weather to mark trees for cutting. That evening, he complained as well of chest congestion, but was cheerful. On Saturday, he awoke to an inflamed throat with difficulty breathing, ordered estate overseer George Rawlins to [[bloodletting|remove nearly a pint of his blood]], a practice of the time, and several physicians were summoned: [[James Craik]], [[Gustavus Richard Brown]], and [[Elisha C. Dick]].{{sfnm|Chernow|2010|1pp=806–10|Morens|1999|2pp=1845-1849}} ([[Dr. William Thornton]] arrived some hours after Washington died.{{sfn|"Death Defied"}})

Dr. Brown thought Washington had [[Peritonsillar abscess|quinsy]]; Dick thought the condition was a more serious "violent inflammation of the throat".{{sfnm|Chernow|2010|1pp=806–807|Lear|1799|2p=257}} Continued bloodletting (approximately five pints) was futile, and his condition deteriorated. Dick unsuccessfully proposed an [[tracheotomy]], unknown to the other two doctors who disapproved.{{sfnm|1a1=Chernow|1y=2010|1pp=806–10|2a1=Felisati|2a2=Sperati|2y=2005|2pp=55–58}} Washington instructed Brown and Dick to leave the room, while he assured Craik, "Doctor, I die hard, but I am not afraid to go."{{sfn|Ellis|2004|p=269}}

Washington's illness and death came more swiftly than expected.{{sfn|Ferling|2009|p=365}} He instructed his private secretary [[Tobias Lear]] to wait three days before his burial, out of fear of being entombed alive.{{sfn|Chernow|2010|p=808}} Washington asked Lear, "Do you understand me ?". "Yes," responded Lear. Washington said, "Tis well."{{sfn|Irving|1857|pp=372-373}} Washington died peacefully with Martha composed at the foot of his bed around 10 p.m. on Saturday, December 14, 1799 at age of sixty-seven. Funeral arrangements included Washington's Masonic lodge of [[Alexandria, Virginia|Alexandria]], Virginia, various members of the clergy, Dr. Craik, military officers, and various members of the Fairfax family. When news of his death reached Congress, they immediately adjourned for the day and the [[Speaker of the United States House of Representatives|Speaker]]'s chair was shrouded in black the next morning.{{sfn|Irving|1857|p=359}}

The funeral was held four days after Washington's death on December 18, 1799, at Mount Vernon, where his body was interred. Cavalry and foot soldiers led the procession, and six colonels served as the pallbearers. The Mount Vernon funeral service was restricted mostly to family and friends.{{sfn|Chernow|2010|pp=808–810}}  Reverend Thomas Davis read the funeral service by the vault with a brief address, followed by a ceremony performed by various members of Washington's Masonic lodge in [[Alexandria, Virginia|Alexandria]].{{sfn|Irving|1857|p=374–375}} Congress chose [[Henry Lee III|Light-Horse Harry Lee]], a Continental Army officer loved by Washington, to deliver the eulogy. Word of his death traveled slowly; church bells rang in the cities, and many places of business closed.{{sfn|Chernow|2010|pp=810–811}} People worldwide admired Washington and were saddened by his death, and memorial processions were held in major cities of the United States. Martha wore a black mourning cape for one year, and she burned their correspondence to protect their privacy. Only five letters between the couple are known to have survived, two letters from Martha to George and three from him to her.{{sfn|Chernow|2010|p=814}}

The diagnosis of Washington's illness and the immediate cause of his death have been subjects of debate since the day that he died. The published account of Drs. Craik and Brown{{efn|The first account of Washington's death was written by Doctors Craik and Brown, published in ''The Times'' of Alexandria five days after his death on December 19, 1799. The complete text can be found in ''The Eclectic Medical Journal'' (1858){{sfnm|1a1=Newton|1a2=Freeman|1a3=Bickley|1y=1858|1pp=273–274}}}} stated that his symptoms had been consistent with ''cynanche trachealis'' ([[trachea]]l inflammation), a term of that period used to describe severe inflammation of the structures of the upper windpipe, including quinsy. Accusations have persisted since Washington's death concerning medical malpractice, with some believing that he had been bled to death.{{sfnm|Chernow|2010|1pp=806–10|2a1=Felisati|2a2=Sperati|2y=2005|2pp=55–58}} Various modern medical authors have speculated that he died from a severe case of [[epiglottitis]] complicated by the given treatments (which were all accepted medical practice in that day), most notably the massive deliberate blood loss, which almost certainly caused [[hypovolemia|hypovolemic shock]].{{sfn|Chernow|2010|p=809}}{{efn|Modern experts have concluded that Washington probably died from acute bacterial epiglottitis complicated by the administered treatments, including Morens and Wallenborn in 1999,{{sfn|Wallenborn|1999}}{{sfn|Morens|1999|pp=1845-1849}} Cheatham in 2008, {{sfn|Cheatham|2008}} and Vadakan in 2005.{{sfn|Vadakan|2005}} These treatments included multiple doses of [[Mercury(I) chloride|calomel]] (a cathartic or purgative) and extensive bloodletting.}}

Washington was buried in the old family vault at Mount Vernon, situated on a grassy slope covered with juniper and cypress trees. It contained the remains of his brother Lawrence and other family members, but the decrepit vault was in need of repair, prompting Washington to leave instructions in his will for the construction of a new vault.{{sfn|Chernow|2010|pp=810–811}}

In 1830, a disgruntled ex-employee of the estate [[Attempted theft of George Washington's head|attempted to steal]] what he thought was Washington's skull, prompting the construction of a more secure vault.{{sfn|Craughwell|2009|pp=77–79}} The next year, the new vault was constructed at Mount Vernon to receive the remains of George and Martha and other relatives.<ref name="NewTomb">[[#tomb|Mount Vernon Ladies' Association, New Tomb]]</ref> In 1832, a joint Congressional committee debated moving his body from Mount Vernon to a crypt in the Capitol. The crypt had been built by architect [[Charles Bulfinch]] in the 1820s during the reconstruction of the burned-out capital, after the [[Burning of Washington]] by the British during the [[War of 1812]]. Southern opposition was intense, antagonized by an ever-growing rift between North and South; many were concerned that Washington's remains could end up on "a shore foreign to his native soil" should the country become divided, and Washington's remains stayed in Mount Vernon.{{sfn|Boorstin|2010|pp=349–50}}

On October 7, 1837, Washington's remains were placed, still in the original lead coffin, within a marble sarcophagus designed by [[William Strickland (architect)|William Strickland]] and constructed by John Struthers earlier that year.{{sfnm|Strickland|1840|1pp=11–14|Carlson, 2016, chapter 1}} The sarcophagus was sealed and encased with planks, and an outer vault was constructed around it.{{sfn|Strickland|1840|pp=11–14}} The outer vault has the sarcophagi of both George and Martha Washington; the inner vault has the remains of other Washington family members and relatives.<ref name = "NewTomb"/>

== Personal life ==
Washington was somewhat reserved in personality, but he generally had a strong presence among others. He made speeches and announcements when required, but he was not a noted orator or debater.{{sfnm|Ferling|2002|1p=16|Randall|1997|2pp=34, 436|Chernow|2010|3pp=29–30}} He was taller than most of his contemporaries;{{sfn|Ferling|2002|p=16}} accounts of his height vary from {{convert|6|ft|m|2|abbr=on}} to {{convert|6|ft|3.5|in|m|2|abbr=on}} tall, and he weighed between {{convert|210-220|lb|kg|0}} as an adult.{{sfnm|Ferling|2002|1p=16|Chernow|2010|2pp=29–30}} He had wide hips, a slim waist, a broad chest, narrow shoulders, muscular thighs, and exceptionally large hands, and he was widely known for his great strength—particularly in his long arms.{{sfn|Chernow|2010|p=123-125}} He had piercing [[Grey eyes|grey-blue eyes]], fair skin, and light [[Chestnut hair|reddish-brown hair]], which he wore powdered in the fashion of the day.{{sfn|Chernow|2010|p=30}} He had a rugged and dominating presence, which garnered respect from his male peers. He suffered frequently from severe tooth decay, and ultimately lost all his teeth but one. He had several sets of false teeth made which he wore during his presidency—none of which were made of wood, contrary to common lore. These dental problems left him in constant pain, for which he took [[laudanum]].{{sfn|Chernow|2010|pp=30, 290, 437–439, 642–643}} As a public figure, he relied upon the strict confidence of his dentist.{{sfn|Chernow|2010|pp=642–643}}

Washington was a talented equestrian early in life. He collected thoroughbreds at Mount Vernon, and his two favorite horses were [[Blueskin (horse)|Blueskin]] and [[Nelson (horse)|Nelson]].{{sfn|Chernow|2010|pp=124, 469}} Fellow Virginian Thomas Jefferson said that Washington was "the best horseman of his age and the most graceful figure that could be seen on horseback";{{sfn|Chernow|2010|p=124}} he also hunted foxes, deer, ducks, and other game.{{sfn|Chernow|2010|p=469}} He was an excellent dancer and attended the theater frequently. He drank in moderation but was morally opposed to excessive drinking, the smoking of tobacco, gambling, and profanity.{{sfn|Chernow|2010|p=134}}

===Slavery===
{{Main|George Washington and slavery|Slavery in the colonial United States}}

Work is by Junius Stearns.|''Washington as Farmer at Mount Vernon''<br>[[Junius Brutus Stearns]], 1851]]

Washington had no animosity toward owning slaves prior to 1775. During the Revolutionary War, however, his views moderated under the influence of anti-slavery officers he was friendly with, such as Lafayette.{{sfnm|Ferling|2002|1pp=163–164|Hirschfeld|1997|2p=2|Flexner|1974|3p=386}} In 1775, Washington initially allowed only 200 blacks to serve in the Continental Army, but by January 1778, he endorsed the New England states plan to recruit enslaved blacks, their eventual emancipation, and compensation to their slave owners. By the end of the war, Washington's integrated army was composed of one-tenth blacks.{{sfn|Taylor|2016|p=231}}

After the war, Washington supported many slaves who were too young or too old to work, greatly increasing Mount Vernon's slave population and causing the plantation to operate at a loss in the process.{{sfnm|Wiencek|2003|1pp=319, 348–349|Flexner|1974|2p=386|Hirschfeld|1997|3p=2|Ellis|2004|4p=167}} He spoke privately often of freeing his slaves, but never publicly condemned the practice, believing the issue would divide the new nation.{{sfnm|Stewart|2007|1p=257|Ferling|2002|2p=275-276}} At the Constitutional Convention, Washington received public criticism in Massachusetts for his silence on slavery.{{sfn|Chernow|2010|pp=536-537}}

While President, Washington maintained close supervision of Mount Vernon through letters to his overseers;{{sfnm|Ferling|2002|1p=46|Chernow|2010|2p=640|Slave Control (Mount Vernon Ladies' Association Essay)}} there is one account from him authorizing a whipping that was given to a slave who had badly beaten his wife.{{sfn|Schenawolf|2015}} At times, Mount Vernon slaves ran away to find freedom.{{sfn|Chernow|2010|pp=637, 759–762}}{{sfn|"Ten Facts About Washington & Slavery"}} To avoid any controversy Washington used secretive methods to return them rather than post public advertisements in the North.{{sfn|Hirschfeld|1997|pp=5,6}}{{efn|For example, Washington privately ordered the capture of Martha's fugitive slave [[Oney Judge]] in 1796; the effort failed.{{sfn|Chernow|2010|pp=637, 759–762}}}}

On his Mount Vernon plantation farms, Washington discouraged cruelty, yet there are records of harsh punishments, including whipping inflicted on male and female slaves by their overseers, some of whom were also slaves. He directed that a warning be given to first offenders before resorting to whipping, which was then subject to his prior approval; this was not always enforced, due to his prolonged absences.{{sfnm|Wiencek|2003|pp=349–350|Ferling|2002|2p=46|Chernow|2010|3pp=113–114, 117}} In severe circumstances, he shipped unruly slaves to the [[West Indies]]. He also used nonviolent forms of discipline, including cash payments, material incentives, and "admonition and advice".{{sfn|Slave Control (Mount Vernon Ladies' Association Essay)}}
Washington sometimes personally cared for ill or injured slaves, and he provided physicians and [[midwife|midwives]]. Washington's slaves were inoculated for [[smallpox]], worked from dawn to dusk, but were poorly clothed and housed. His slaves received two hours off for meals during the workday, and were not put to work on Sundays (the [[Sabbath]]), [[Christmas]], [[Easter]], or [[Pentecost]].{{sfnm|Chernow|2010|1p=111|Ferling|2002|2p=46|Schwarz|2001|3pp=27, 83|Slave Labor (Mount Vernon Ladies' Association Essay)}}

By 1799, there were 317 slaves living at Mount Vernon; he owned 124 outright and held 153 for his wife's [[dower]] interest.{{sfn|"Ten Facts About Washington & Slavery"}} During the summer, Washington made a new will that directed his 124 slaves be freed upon the death of Martha.{{sfn|Ferling|2002|p=277}} He was among the few slave-holding Founding Fathers to do so.{{sfn|Wiencek|2003|pp=352–354}} He provided that old and young freed people be taken care of indefinitely; younger ones were to be taught to read and write and placed in suitable occupations. Martha freed his slaves on January 1, 1801, a year after Washington's death and a year before her own. Modern historian [[John E. Ferling]] has posited that Washington's freeing of his slaves through his will was "an act of atonement for a lifetime of concurrence in human exploitation".{{sfn|Ferling|2002|p=277}}

===Religion and Freemasonry===
{{Main|Religious views of George Washington|American Enlightenment}}

Washington descended from Anglican minister [[Lawrence Washington (1602–1653)|Lawrence Washington]] (his great-great-grandfather), whose troubles with the [[Church of England]] may have prompted his heirs to emigrate to America.{{sfn|Tsakiridis|2018}} Washington was baptized as an infant in April 1732 and became a devoted member of the Church of England (the [[Anglican Church]]).{{sfnm|Chernow|2010|1p=6|Morrison|2009|2p=136|Alden|1996|3p=2, 26|Randall|1997|4p=17|Tsakiridis|2018}} He served for over twenty years as a [[vestryman]] and [[churchwarden]] for [[Fairfax Parish, Virginia|Fairfax Parish]] and [[Truro Parish, Virginia|Truro Parish]].{{sfnm|Chernow|2010|1p=130|Thompson|2008|2p=40|Tsakiridis|2018}} He privately prayed and read the [[Bible]] daily, and he publicly encouraged people and the nation to pray.{{sfnm|Frazer|2012|1pp=198–199|Chernow|2010|2p=119, 132|Tsakiridis|2018}} He may have taken [[Eucharist|communion]] on a regular basis prior to the Revolutionary War, but he did not do so following the war, for which he was admonished by Pastor [[James Abercrombie (Episcopal priest)|James Abercrombie]].{{sfnm|Chernow|2010|1pp=131, 470|Johnstone|1919|2pp=87–195|Espinosa|2009|3p=52|Frazer|2012|4pp=201–203|Tsakiridis|2018}}

[[File:Washington Masonic print.jpg|thumb|upright|alt=Washington is shown presiding as Master Mason over a lodge meeting.|George Washington as Master of his Lodge, 1793]]

Washington believed in a "wise, inscrutable, and irresistible" [[creator deity|Creator God]] who was active in the Universe, contrary to [[deism|deistic thought]].{{sfn|Tsakiridis|2018}} He referred to this God by the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] terms ''[[divine providence|Providence]]'', the ''Creator'', or the ''Almighty'', and also as the ''Divine Author'' or the ''Supreme Being''.{{sfnm|Randall|1997|1p=67|Tsakiridis|2018}} He believed in a divine power who watched over battlefields, was involved in the outcome of war, was protecting his life, and was involved in American politics—and specifically in the creation of the United States.{{sfnm|Chernow|2010|1p=131|Tsakiridis|2018}} Modern historian [[Ron Chernow]] has posited that Washington avoided [[evangelism|evangelistic]] Christianity or [[fire and brimstone|hellfire-and-brimstone]] speech along with communion and anything inclined to "flaunt his religiosity". Chernow has also said Washington "never used his religion as a device for [[partisan (politics)|partisan]] purposes or in official undertakings".{{sfn|Chernow|2010|pp=131–132}} No mention of [[Jesus|Jesus Christ]] appears in [[The Washington Papers|his private correspondence]], and such references are rare in his public writings.{{sfnm|Novak|2007|1p=95|Tsakiridis|2018}} He often quoted from the Bible or paraphrased it, and often referred to the Anglican [[Book of Common Prayer]].{{sfnm|Chernow|2010|1pp=131–132|Morrison|2009|2p=136|Tsakiridis|2018}} There is debate on whether he is best classed as a Christian, a [[theistic rationalism|theistic rationalist]], or both.{{sfnm|Frazer|2012|1pp=197–198, 201–203|Novak|2007|2pp=158–161}}

Washington emphasized [[Toleration#In the Enlightenment|religious toleration]] in a nation with numerous [[Christian denomination|denominations]] and religions.{{sfn|Novak|2007|p=122}} He attended services of different Christian denominations and prohibited [[anti-Catholicism in the United States|anti-Catholic celebrations]] in the Army.{{sfn|Boller|1963|p=125}} He engaged workers at Mount Vernon without regard for religious belief or affiliation. While President, he acknowledged major religious sects and gave speeches on religious toleration.{{sfn|Chernow|2010|p=131}} He was distinctly rooted in the ideas, values, and modes of thinking of the Enlightenment.{{sfn|Wood|2001|p=313}} He harbored no contempt of [[organized religion|organized]] Christianity and its clergy, "being no bigot myself to any mode of worship".{{sfn|Wood|2001|p=313}} He proclaimed in 1793, "We have abundant reason to rejoice that in this Land the light of truth and reason has triumphed over the power of bigotry and superstition."{{sfn|Lillback|Newcombe|2006|p=313–314}}

[[Freemasonry]] was a widely accepted institution in the late 18th century, known for advocating moral teachings.{{sfnm|Chernow|2010|1pp=132, 500|Morrison|2009|2p=136|Stavish|2007|3pp=XIX, XXI|Immekus|2018}} Washington was attracted to the Masons' dedication to the Enlightenment principles of rationality, reason, and brotherhood. The American [[Masonic lodge|lodges]] did not share the [[anti-clericalism|anti-clerical]] perspective of the [[anticlericalism and Freemasonry|controversial European lodges]].{{sfn|Chernow|2010|pp=27, 704}} A Masonic lodge was established in [[Fredericksburg, Virginia|Fredericksburg]], Virginia, in September 1752, and Washington was initiated two months later at the age of 20 as one of its first Entered Apprentices. Within a year, he progressed through its ranks to become a Master Mason.{{sfnm|Randall|1997|1p=67|Chernow|2010|2p=27}} Before and during the American Revolution he used Masonic lodges as meeting places to plot against the British. Washington had a high regard for the Masonic Order, but his personal lodge attendance was sporadic. In 1777, a convention of Virginia lodges asked him to be the Grand Master of the newly established [[Grand Lodge of Virginia]], but he declined due to his commitments leading the Continental Army. After 1782, he corresponded frequently with Masonic lodges and members,{{sfn|Immekus|2018}} and in 1788 he was listed as Master in the Virginia charter of [[Alexandria-Washington Lodge No. 22|Alexandria Lodge No. 22]].{{sfn|"A Brief History" (GWMNMA)}}

Washington's legacy endures as one of the most influential in American history, since he served as commander-in-chief of the Continental Army, a hero of the Revolution, and the first president of the United States. Various historians maintained that Washington was a dominant factor in America's founding, the Revolutionary War, the Constitutional Convention. Congressman [[Henry Lee III|Light-Horse Harry Lee]], a Revolutionary War comrade, [[s:The Father of His Country|eulogized Washington]]: "First in war—first in peace—and first in the hearts of his countrymen."{{sfn|Ferling|2009|pp=3–4}} Lee's words became the hallmark by which Washington's reputation was impressed upon the American memory, with some biographers regarding him as the great exemplar of [[republicanism]]. Washington set many precedents for the national government and the presidency in particular, and he was called the "Father of His Country" as early as 1778.{{sfnm|1a1=Unger|1y=2013|1pp=236–37|2a1=Parry|2a2=Allison|2y=1991|2p=xi|Hindle|2017|3p=92}}{{efn|The earliest known ''image'' in which Washington is identified as the Father of His Country is in the frontispiece of a 1779 German-language almanac, with calculations by [[David Rittenhouse]] and published by Francis Bailey in Lancaster County Pennsylvania.

In 1885, Congress proclaimed Washington's birthday to be a federal holiday.{{sfn|Ferling|2009|p=4}} Twentieth-century biographer [[Douglas Southall Freeman]] concluded, "The great big thing stamped across that man is [[moral character|character]]." Modern historian [[David Hackett Fischer]] has expanded upon Freeman's assessment, defining Washington's character as "integrity, self-discipline, courage, absolute honesty, resolve, and decision, but also forbearance, decency, and respect for others".{{sfn|Fischer|2004|p=446}}

Washington became an international symbol for liberation and nationalism, as the leader of the first successful revolution against a [[colonial empire]]. The [[Federalist Party|Federalists]] made him the symbol of their party, but the [[Democratic-Republican Party|Jeffersonians]] continued to distrust his influence for many years and delayed building the [[Washington Monument]].{{sfn|Cunliffe|1958|pp=24–26}} On January 31, 1781 (before he had even begun his presidency), he was elected a member of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]].{{sfn|Willard|2017}} During the [[United States Bicentennial]], to ensure Washington would never by outranked, Washington was posthumously appointed to the grade of General of the Armies of the United States by the congressional joint resolution [[s:Public Law 94-479|Public Law 94-479]] passed on January 19, 1976, with an effective appointment date of July 4, 1976.{{sfn|Bell|1992|pp=52, 66}}{{efn|In ''Portraits & Biographical Sketches of the United States Army's Senior Officer'',{{sfn|Bell|1992|p=52}} William Gardner Bell states that Washington was recalled back into military service from his retirement in 1798, and "Congress passed legislation that would have made him General of the Armies of the United States, but his services were not required in the field and the appointment was not made until the Bicentennial in 1976, when it was bestowed posthumously as a commemorative honor." In 1976, President [[Gerald Ford]] specified that Washington would "rank first among all officers of the Army, past and present."{{sfn|"Five-star Generals, 2017"}}}} [[Mason Locke Weems|Parson Weems]]'s hagiographical account ''The Life of Washington'' (1809) helped elevate Washington to heroic legendary status.{{sfn|Delbanco|1999}} The authenticity of Weems's anecdotes, which include the story of Washington cutting down the cherry tree as a child and his utterance "I cannot tell a lie", is unknown.{{sfnm|Levy|2013|1pp=6, 217|Weems|1918|2p=22}}{{efn|The idea of Washington "cutting down" the cherry tree is a revision of Weem's original account, where he maintains that only "barking" (removal of bark from the tree) occurred.{{sfnm|Levy|2013|1pp=6, 217|Weems|1918|2p=22}}}}

Historian [[Gordon S.

The serious collection and publication of Washington's documentary record began with the pioneer work of [[Jared Sparks]] in the 1830s in ''Life and Writings of George Washington'' (12 vols., 1834–1837).{{sfn|Sparks|1839|p=Title page}} ''The Writings of George Washington from the Original Manuscript Sources, 1745–1799'' (1931–44) is a 39-volume set edited by [[John Clement Fitzpatrick]] who was commissioned by the ''George Washington Bicentennial Commission''.
