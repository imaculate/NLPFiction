The '''''Pennsylvania Chronicle and Universal Advertiser''''' was an American colonial newspaper founded in 1767 that was published in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, prior to the [[American Revolution]] and was founded by [[William Goddard (US patriot/publisher)|William Goddard]] and his business  partners [[Joseph Galloway]] and [[Thomas Wharton Jr.|Thomas Wharton]]. [[Benjamin Franklin]], an associate of Galloway, was also a partner with the ''Chronicle''.<ref name="Smithsonian+Constitutional Post"/>

The newspaper was established to challenge the power of the Penn family and ultimately the Crown authorities who at that time were placing laws and taxes on the colonists without fair representation in the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|British Parliament]].

The ''Chronicle'' was published once a week on a Monday, the first issue being released on January 6, 1767, and was printed from a new ''Bourgeois type set'' by Goddard's printing company in Philadelphia, ''The New Printing Office'', on Market-Street, near the Post-Office. The annual subscription rate was ten shillings.<ref name="Justor-Franklin">{{cite journal |jstor=20089013

In 1768 William's sister, [[Mary Katherine Goddard]] who later became famous for being the first woman to be a postmaster in Maryland, later joined and managed her brother's printing office in Philadelphia.<ref name="Maryland State Archives">[http://www.msa.md.gov/megafile/msa/speccol/sc3500/sc3520/002800/002809/html/2809bio.html Maryland State Archives]</ref>

By 1770 the ''Pennsylvania Chronicle'' had a circulation of about twenty-five hundred, making it one of the most successful colonial newspapers.<ref name="Goddard-encyclopedia.com">{{cite web |url=http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1G2-2536600511.html#A

In the middle of the 18th century most of the printing presses that were in use in the American colonies were imported from England. [[Isaac Doolittle]], a New-Haven watch and clock-maker, built the mahogany printing press for Goddard's ''Pennsylvania Chronicle'' in Philadelphia. It was the first printing press built in the American colonies.<ref name="1st Printing Press">{{cite web |url=http://www.conntact.com/archive_index/archive_pages/1991_Business_New_Haven.html |title=The New Haven Enterprise - Small Businessperson: Isaac Doolittle |author= Priscilla Searles |accessdate=19 October 2010}}</ref><ref>Steiner, Bruce, E., Connecticut Anglicans in the Revolutionary Era: A Study in Communal Tensions, Hartford: American Revolution Bicentennial Commission of Connecticut, 1978, p.23</ref>

Goddard's newspaper was not without its competition. A rival Philadelphia printer, [[William Bradford (American Revolutionary printer)|William Bradford III]], founder of ''The Pennsylvania Journal and Weekly Advertiser'' in 1742 conducted a newspaper war against Goddard that digressed into personal attacks.

During this time Galloway and Wharton had sold their shares of the ''Chronicle'' to a Robert Towne, who in turn made many attempts to persuade Goddard to sell his newspaper to him. After Goddard publicly criticized Galloway and Wharton he subsequently found himself jailed for debt in September 1771, no doubt at the prompting of the influential Galloway.

==''Chronicle'' a revolutionary voice==
The paper was a primary means in voicing the anti-British sentiment that was rapidly spreading throughout the colonies prior to the [[American Revolution]]. The paper gained much notoriety when Goddard printed an article voicing his support for the [[Boston Tea Party]].

The paper's sympathies and general revolutionary message were a cause of great concern to the British. Soon the newspaper was heavily taxed for its delivery by the Crown Post (the colonial mail system in use at the time), and later the Crown Post simply refused to deliver the publication. The Crown Post finally drove the newspaper out of business in 1773. This prompted Goddard and [[Benjamin Franklin]] to establish an alternative mail system independent of the Crown Post authorities. This alternative system ultimately became the basis of a postal system that would later become the US Post Office.<ref name="Smithsonian+Constitutional Post">{{cite web |url=http://www.postalmuseum.si.edu/exhibits/2a1f_wgoddard.html

===Dickinson's letters===
From 1767 to 1768 the ''Pennsylvania Chronicle'' published a series of 12 essays called ''[[Letters from a Farmer in Pennsylvania|Letters from a Farmer in Pennsylvania to the Inhabitants of the British Colonies]]'', by [[John Dickinson (Pennsylvania and Delaware)|John Dickinson]]. In these letters, Dickinson asserted the political philosophy of [[John Locke]] as the moral basis of the objections to the excessive British taxation of the colonies. Dickinson in no uncertain terms urged the American colonists to oppose British actions by legal petition, then boycott, and finally, if need be, by force of arms.<ref name="Dickinson ency.com">{{cite web |url=https://www.archives.gov/exhibits/charters/constitution_founding_fathers_pennsylvania.html |author1=James D.

===Voice against the Stamp Act===
The August 1, 1768, issue of the ''Pennsylvania Chronicle'' printed on the front page a four-column article of an address made at the State House (Independence Hall) against the [[Stamp Act]], and other excessive tax laws passed without colonial representation in the [[Parliament of England|British Parliament]].<ref>[http://www.worthpoint.com/worthopedia/the-pennsylvania-chronicle-and-universal-advertiser Ira & Larry Goldberg Coins & Collectibles, Inc.]</ref>

===Support for Boston Tea Party===
In 1773 the paper gained much notoriety when <!--Goddard himself?--> it featured an article chronicling the unfolding of the [[Boston Tea Party]] and voicing popular support for this rebellious and historic event.

===''Chronicle'' vindicates Franklin===
While [[Benjamin Franklin]] was in London as agent for Pennsylvania he opposed the enactment of the [[Stamp Act]] in 1765.  Although he knew passage of the bill was inevitable he went along with the measure while actually working for its repeal.<ref name="1st Printing Press2">{{cite web |url=https://www.archives.gov/exhibits/charters/constitution_founding_fathers_pennsylvania.html |title=The Founding Fathers: Pennsylvania: Benjamin Franklin, Pennsylvania |publisher=The National Archives |accessdate=19 October 2010}}</ref>
The people of Pennsylvania however suspected Franklin of duplicity.  To offset malicious partisan speculations and attacks over Franklin's involvement in the passage of the Stamp Act [[William Goddard (US patriot/publisher)|William Goddard]] reprinted almost the entire collection of Franklin essays from London papers in the ''Pennsylvania Chronicle'' which summarized Franklin's involvement and underlying opposition to the passage of this act.<ref name="FRANKLIN'S POLITICAL JOURNALISM">{{cite web |url=http://deepblue.lib.umich.edu/bitstream/2027.42/32591/1/0000722.pdf |title=FRANKLIN'S POLITICAL JOURNALISM IN ENGLAND.* |author= VERNER W.
