The '''United States Ambassador to Sweden''' ({{lang-sv|USA:s ambassadör i Sverige}}) serves as the official diplomatic representative of the [[President of the United States|President]] and the [[Government of the United States of America]] to the [[Monarchy of Sweden|King]] and the [[Government of Sweden|Government of the Kingdom of Sweden]]. [[Sweden – United States relations|Diplomatic relations between Sweden and the United States]] began with the signing of the [[Treaty of Amity and Commerce (United States–Sweden)|Treaty of Amity and Commerce]] in 1783. 

In addition, from 1814 to 1905 the United States Chief of Mission in Sweden also represented United States interest with respect to [[Norway]]; as the latter was during that period of time aligned with Sweden, for purposes of foreign relations, in the [[Union between Sweden and Norway]]. 

The contemporary tendency of American presidents (of both parties) is to appoint keen political [[fundraisers]] and/or prominent supporters from previous presidential election campaigns, rather than promoting professional members of the [[United States Foreign Service]] to the top position.

The current acting Ambassador is [[David Lindwall]], who assumed his duties in 2017.

==Residence==
[[Image:Diplomatstaden 2008 Leg 3.jpg|thumb|250px|left|The residence ("Villa Åkerlund") of the U.S. Ambassador in Stockholm, Sweden.]]
Since the 1930s, the ambassador is resident in the [[ambassadorial residence]], ''Villa Åkerlund'', of the [[United States Embassy]] in [[Diplomatstaden]], [[Stockholm]].
