The '''Old South Meeting House''' is a historic [[Congregationalism in the United States|Congregational]] church building located at the corner of [[Milk Street, Boston|Milk]] and [[Washington Street (Boston)|Washington Street]]s in the [[Downtown Crossing]] area of [[Boston, Massachusetts]], built in 1729. It gained fame as the organizing point for the [[Boston Tea Party]] on December 16, 1773. Five thousand or more colonists<ref>John Galvin puts that number as high as 8,000 (''Three Men of Boston'', New York: Thomas Cromwell, 1976, p. 268).</ref> gathered at the Meeting House, the largest building in Boston at the time.

==History==

===Church (1729–1872)===
The church was completed in 1729, with its 56&nbsp;m (183&nbsp;ft) steeple. The congregation was gathered in 1669 when it broke off from [[First Church of Boston]], a [[Congregationalism in the United States|Congregational]] church founded by [[John Winthrop]] in 1630. The site was a gift of Mrs. Norton, widow of [[John Norton (Puritan divine)|John Norton]], pastor of the [[First Church in Boston]].<ref>{{cite book |title= The Pilgrims of Boston and their Descendants|last=Bridgeman |first=Thomas |year= 1856|publisher=D.

Thomas Thatcher, a native of [[Salisbury]], England. Thatcher was also a physician and is known for publishing the first medical tract in Massachusetts.

After the [[Boston Massacre]] in 1770, yearly anniversary meetings were held at the church until 1775, featuring speakers such as [[John Hancock]] and [[Dr. Joseph Warren]]. In 1773, 5,000 people met in the Meeting House to debate British taxation and, after the meeting, a group raided three tea ships anchored nearby in what became known as the [[Boston Tea Party]].

In 1775, the British occupied the Meeting House due to its association with the Revolutionary cause. They gutted the building, filled it with dirt, and then used the interior to practice horse riding. They destroyed much of the interior and stole various items, including [[William Bradford (Plymouth governor)|William Bradford]]'s [[Of Plymouth Plantation]] (1620), a unique Pilgrim manuscript hidden in Old South's tower.  After the British evacuated Boston, the plan for rebuilding the interior of the church was drawn by [[Thomas Dawes]].<ref>Eckley, Joseph.  "Obituary: Sketch of the Character of the Late Hon. Thomas Dawes, Esq.," 1809, Boston Athenaeum Library, Tracts B438, B1213.</ref>

Old South Meeting House was almost destroyed in the [[Great Boston Fire of 1872]], saved by the timely arrival of a fire engine from Portsmouth, New Hampshire, but the fire caused the city's residential districts to shift toward the Back Bay, away from the church.  The congregation then built a new church building (the "New" [[Old South Church]] at [[Copley Square]]) which remains its home to this day. The Old South congregation returns to Old South Meeting House for services in its ancestral home once a year, on the Sunday before [[Thanksgiving]].

===Museum (1877–present)===
Old South Meeting House has been an important gathering place for nearly three centuries. Renowned for the protest meetings held here before the American Revolution when the building was termed a ''[[mouth-house]],'' this [[National Historic Landmark]] has long served as a platform for the free expression of ideas. Today, the Old South Meeting House is open daily as a museum and continues to provide a place for people to meet, discuss and act on important issues of the day. The stories of the men and women who are part of Old South's vital heritage reveal why the Old South Meeting House occupies an enduring place in the history of the United States.

The museum and historic site is located at the intersection of [[Washington Street (Boston)|Washington]] and [[Milk Street, Boston|Milk Street]]s and can be visited for a nominal sum. It is located near the [[State Street (MBTA station)|State Street]], [[Downtown Crossing (MBTA station)|Downtown Crossing]] and [[Park Street (MBTA station)|Park Street]] [[MBTA]] (subway) stations.

The Old South Meeting House is claimed to be the second oldest establishment existent in the United States. It is currently under consideration for local landmark status by the [[Boston Landmarks Commission]].<ref>https://www.cityofboston.gov/images_documents/PETSTATS_June2016_tcm3-53570.pdf</ref>
