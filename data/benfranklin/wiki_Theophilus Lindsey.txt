'''Theophilus Lindsey''' (20 June 1723 [[Old Style|O.S.]] &ndash; 3 November 1808) was an [[England|English]] theologian and clergyman who founded the first avowedly [[Unitarianism|Unitarian]] congregation in the country, at [[Essex Street Chapel]].

==Early life==
Lindsey was born in [[Middlewich]], [[Cheshire]], the son of Robert Lindsey, a [[mercer (occupation)|mercer]], and godson of [[Theophilus Hastings, 9th Earl of Huntingdon]], for whose mother his mother had been a servant.<ref name="ODNB">{{cite ODNB|id=16722|first=G.

Ordained deacon in 1746 and priest in 1747, Lindsey's church career advanced by aristocratic patronage. For some time he was a [[curate]] in [[Spitalfields]], [[London]], a position found for him by Lady Ann Hastings, aunt to the 9th Earl.<ref name="ODNB"/> The nomination was by [[Granville Wheler]], Lady Ann's brother-in-law.<ref>{{cite book|last=Lindsey|first=Theophilus|editor=G.

Lindsey was domestic chaplain to [[Algernon Seymour, 7th Duke of Somerset]], who died in 1750. Then he was employed as tutor to the Duke's young grandson, Lord Warkworth—[[Hugh Percy, 2nd Duke of Northumberland|Hugh Percy]], originally Hugh Smithson, the future 2nd Duke of Northumberland—from 1751 to 1753 travelling on the continent of [[Europe]].<ref name="ODNB"/> Warkworth was destined for [[Eton College]], and Lindsey turned down the post of accompanying him there which went to [[Charles Dodgson (bishop)|Charles Dodgson]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Baker|first=Thomas|title=History of the College of St. John the Evangelist, Cambridge|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qfApAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA713|accessdate=18 August 2018|year=1869|publisher=University Press|page=713}}</ref>

==Parish priest==
Lindsey was then presented to the [[Benefice#Current usage|living]] of [[Kirkby Wiske]] in [[Yorkshire]], by [[Hugh Percy, 1st Duke of Northumberland]].<ref>{{cite book|last=McCormmach|first=Russell|title=Weighing the World: The Reverend John Michell of Thornhill|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9eMkgfKIdXIC&pg=PA312|accessdate=18 August 2018|date=2011-12-07|publisher=Springer Science & Business Media|isbn=9789400720220|pages=312 note 8}}</ref> He was present there in 1753–4.<ref>{{cite book|last=Lindsey|first=Theophilus|editor=G.

After exchanging it for that of [[Puddletown|Piddletown]] in [[Dorset]], in the gift of [[Francis Hastings, 10th Earl of Huntingdon]], he rejected a chance to go to Dublin with the Duke of Northumberland, who became [[Lord Lieutenant of Ireland]] in 1762.<ref name="ODNB"/> At Piddleton he came to know [[Thomas Hollis (1720–1774)|Thomas Hollis]] of [[Corscombe]], and through him [[William Harris (historian)|William Harris]], both dissenters.<ref>{{cite book|last=Lindsey|first=Theophilus|editor=G.

==Vicar of Catterick==
[[File:Catterick Font Salvin.jpg|thumb|15th century font in the [[Church of St Anne, Catterick]]]]
In 1763 Lindsey went to the [[Church of St Anne, Catterick]] in North Yorkshire.<ref name="ODNB"/> He owed the living, in the gift of the Crown, to the influence of the Earl of Huntingdon.<ref>{{cite book|last=Lindsey|first=Theophilus|editor=G. M. Ditchfield|title=The Letters of Theophilus Lindsey (1723–1808) Vol. 1 1747–1788|year=2007|publisher=Boydell Press|isbn=9781843833444|page=xlii}}</ref> 

According to [[Catharine Harrison]], daughter of Jeremiah Harrison who had been the previous vicar, the wishes of Hannah Lindsey to be closer to her Blackburne relations had much to do with the move.<ref>{{cite book|last=Cappe|first=Catharine|title=Memoirs of the Life of the Late Mrs. Catharine Cappe|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7XQRAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA78|accessdate=26 August 2018|year=1822|publisher=Longman, Hurst, Rees, Orme, and Brown|page=78}}</ref> The parish had at around this time about 400 households, and a local Catholic gentry family, represented by Sir Henry Lawson, 4th Baronet at [[Brough Hall]]. Lindsey was wary of Catholic influence. There was some Methodist belief, but hardly any dissenting nonconformity.<ref>{{cite book|last=Lindsey|first=Theophilus|editor=G. M. Ditchfield|title=The Letters of Theophilus Lindsey (1723–1808) Vol. 1 1747–1788|year=2007|publisher=Boydell Press|isbn=9781843833444|page=xliv}}</ref>  Around 1764 Lindsey founded a [[Sunday school]].<ref>{{cite book|last1=McCall|first1=H B|title=Richmondshire Churches|date=1910|publisher=Elliott Stock|location=London|pages=34&ndash;35|oclc=6723172}}</ref> Hannah ran a dispensary and encouraged [[inoculation]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Lindsey|first=Theophilus|editor=G.

Entertaining [[Nontrinitarianism|anti-Trinitarian]] views, Lindsey was troubled by their inconsistency with Anglican belief. On Lindsey's own account, he was influenced by [[William Robertson (Irish priest)|William Robertson]] and his ''Attempt to explain the words reason, substance, person, creeds, orthodoxy, Catholic-church, subscription, and Index expurgatorius'' of 1766, with letter to his diocesan bishop from 1760 in the later editions.<ref>{{cite ODNB|id=23816|first=M. A.|last=Stewart|title=Robertson, William}}</ref> From 1769 the close friendship of [[Joseph Priestley]] served to foster Lindsey's scruples. Lindsey was writing to him in Leeds by 1772.<ref>{{cite book|last=Lindsey|first=Theophilus|editor=G. M. Ditchfield|title=The Letters of Theophilus Lindsey (1723–1808) Vol. 1 1747–1788|year=2007|publisher=Boydell Press|isbn=9781843833444|page=127}}</ref>

==The Feathers Tavern Petition==
In 1771 Lindsey joined with Blackburne, [[John Jebb (reformer)|John Jebb]] (1736–1786), [[Christopher Wyvill]] (1740–1822) and [[Edmund Law]] (1703–1787), [[bishop of Carlisle]], in preparing a petition to [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament]]. This petition, now called the [[Feathers Tavern Petition]], prayed that clergymen of the Church of England and graduates of the universities might be relieved from the burden of subscribing to the [[Thirty-Nine Articles]], and "restored to their undoubted rights as Protestants of interpreting Scripture for themselves".<ref name="Whelan2009">{{cite book|last=Whelan|first=Timothy D.|title=Baptist Autographs in the John Rylands University Library of Manchester, 1741-1845|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pwd5GuvnedgC&pg=PA417|accessdate=18 August 2018|year=2009|publisher=Mercer University Press|isbn=9780881461442|page=417}}</ref> 

Two hundred and fifty signatures were obtained, but in February 1772 the [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]] declined even to receive the petition by a majority of 217 to 71; the adverse vote was repeated in the following year. At the end of 1773, Lindsey resigned as vicar of the Church of England. He became instead a leading Unitarian.<ref name="Whelan2009"/>

==Later life==
On the way from Catterick to London, Lindsey and his wife stayed with [[William Turner (minister at Wakefield)|William Turner]] in Wakefield, a minister whose beliefs had become Unitarian. His advice to Lindsey was to become likewise a dissenting minister.<ref>{{cite ODNB|id=27877|first=John|last=Goodchild|title=Turner, William}}</ref> [[Alexander Gordon (Unitarian)|Alexander Gordon]] writing in the ''[[Dictionary of National Biography]]'' commented that Turner disapproved of Lindsey's idea of leading a secession from the Church of England.<ref>{{cite DNB|wstitle=Turner, William (1714-1794)|volume=57}}</ref>

In April 1774 Lindsey began to conduct Unitarian services in a room in Essex Street, the [[Strand, London|Strand]], London, where [[Essex Street Chapel]] was built. Among the trustees was [[Samuel Heywood (chief justice)|Samuel Heywood]].<ref>{{cite ODNB|first=G. M.|last=Ditchfield|id=13189|title=Heywood, Samuel (1753–1828)|accessedate= 29 December 2008}} </ref> Here Lindsey remained till 1793 when he resigned his charge in favour of [[John Disney (Unitarian)|John Disney]], who like himself had left the established church and had become his colleague. 

Lindsey helped to spread Unitarianism to Wales through his correspondence with [[Tomos Glyn Cothi]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Kirk|first=John|title=Cultures of Radicalism in Britain and Ireland|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mYxECgAAQBAJ&pg=PA120|accessdate=19 August 2018|date=2015-10-06|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781317320654|page=120}}</ref> Later the Unitarian offices, first the [[British and Foreign Unitarian Association]] and then the [[General Assembly of Unitarian and Free Christian Churches]], were established in Essex Street.

In 1800 he received a considerable bequest from [[Elizabeth Rayner]], a wealthy member of his congregation, and as a result his final years were spent in comfort. He died at home in Essex Street on 3 November 1808, and was buried in [[Bunhill Fields]] burial ground. By the request of Elizabeth Rayner, who had died in 1800, her remains were placed in the same grave. Lindsey was succeeded as minister at Essex Street from 1805 by [[Thomas Belsham]], who wrote Lindsey's biography (published in 1812), and who, following his own death in 1829, was also buried in the same grave.

==Works==

Lindsey's major work was ''An Historical View of the State of the Unitarian Doctrine and Worship from the Reformation to our own Times'' (1783).<ref>{{cite book|last=Lindsey|first=Theophilus|title=An Historical View of the State of the Unitarian Doctrine and Worship: From the Reformation to Our Own Times|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fVwVAAAAQAAJ|accessdate=19 August 2018|year=1783|publisher=J. Johnson}}</ref> It was written in response to the ''Plea for the Divinity of Christ'' of the Baptist minister [[Robert Robinson (Baptist)|Robert Robinson]].<ref name="Whelan2009"/> There was a 1785 reply to it, arguing against Lindsey's use of [[Abraham Tucker]]'s views on the Trinity, by Thomas Kynaston as "A Layman", on behalf of Tucker's daughter.<ref>{{cite book|last=Halkett|first=Samuel|title=Dictionary of Anonymous and Pseudonymous English Literature|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fRfBroP_QZ4C&pg=PA315|accessdate=19 August 2018|year=1926|publisher=Ardent Media|page=315}}</ref> Lindsey's other publications included:

*''The Book of Common Prayer, reformed according to the plan of the late Dr Samuel Clarke'' (1774). [[Samuel Clarke]] (1675–1729), a cleric and philosopher with views close to those of [[Isaac Newton]], left manuscript comments on the ''[[Book of Common Prayer]]'' that were given by his son to the [[British Museum]], in 1768. Lindsey returned several times to revisions of this prayer book, for the Essex Street Chapel, after John Disney had copied out the comments. By 1789 he removed the [[Apostles' Creed]]. His work influenced also Presbyterians, who published five liturgies based on it in the years 1776 to 1791.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Platten|first1=Stephen|last2=Woods|first2=Christopher|title=Comfortable Words: Polity, Piety and the Book of Common Prayer|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=g3GfTeT9NgQC&pg=PA93|accessdate=19 August 2018|year=2012|publisher=Hymns Ancient and Modern Ltd|isbn=9780334046707|page=93}}</ref>

*''Conversations upon Christian Idolatry'' (1792)
*''Conversations on the Divine Government, shewing that everything is from God, and for good, to all'' (1802). 

Two volumes of sermons, with prayers annexed, were published posthumously in 1810.

[[Thomas Belsham]]'s ''Memoirs of the Late Reverend Theophilus Lindsey, M.A., including a brief analysis of his works; together with anecdotes and letters of eminent persons, his friends and correspondents; also a general view of the progress of the Unitarian doctrine in England and America'' appeared in 1812.
