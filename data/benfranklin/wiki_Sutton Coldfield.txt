== History ==

=== Etymology ===
The [[etymology]] of the name Sutton appears to be from "South Town".
<blockquote>The name "Sutton Coldfield" appears to come from this time, being the "south town" (i.e. south of Tamworth and/or Lichfield) on the edge of the "col field". "Col" is usually derived from "charcoal", charcoal burners presumably being active in the area.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sp.scnhs.org.uk/history.html |title=Sutton Park - History |publisher=Sp.scnhs.org.uk |date=7 December 2012 |accessdate=18 May 2014}}</ref> </blockquote>

=== Prehistory ===
The earliest known signs of human presence in Sutton Coldfield were discovered in 2001–2003 on the boundaries of the town.<ref name=Archeology>{{cite web|title=The Archaeology of the M6 Toll 2000-2003 |url=http://www.wessexarch.co.uk/publications/archaeology-m6-toll-2000-2003 |work=Wessex Archeology Online |accessdate=23 July 2015}}</ref> Archaeological surveys undertaken in preparation for the construction of the [[M6 Toll]] road revealed evidence of [[Bronze Age Britain|Bronze Age]] [[burnt mound]]s near Langley Mill Farm, at Langley Brook. Additionally, evidence for a Bronze Age burial mound was discovered, one of only two in Birmingham with the other being located in [[Kingstanding]]. Excavations also uncovered the presence of an [[British Iron Age|Iron Age]] settlement, dating to around 400 and 100&nbsp;BC,<ref name="M6TA" /> consisting of circular houses built over at least three phases surrounded by ditches.<ref>{{cite web|last=Hodder |first=Mike |title=Burnt mounds and beyond: the later prehistory of Birmingham and the Black Country |url=http://www.iaa.bham.ac.uk/research/projects/wmrrfa/seminar2/Mike_Hodder.doc |work=West Midlands Regional Research Framework for Archaeology, Seminar 2 |publisher=University of Birmingham |accessdate=13 September 2010|format=doc}}{{dead link|date=July 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Dargue |first=William |title=Langley, Langley Gorse, Langley Heath, Sutton Coldfield |url=http://billdargue.jimdo.com/placenames-gazetteer-a-to-y/places-l/langley-sutton-coldfield/ |work=A History of Birmingham Places & Placenames . . .  from A to Y |accessdate=13 September 2010}}</ref> Closer to Langley Brook (a tributary of the [[River Tame, West Midlands|River Tame]]), excavations uncovered the remains of a single circular house surrounded by ditches, dating from the same period.<ref name="M6TA">{{cite web|title=M6 Toll Motorway |url=http://www.birmingham.gov.uk/cs/Satellite?c=Page&childpagename=Planning-Management/PageLayout&cid=1223092741607&pagename=BCC/Common/Wrapper/Wrapper&rendermode=Live |publisher=Birmingham City Council |accessdate=13 September 2010}}</ref>

Near to Langley Mill Farm is Fox Hollies, where archaeological surveys have uncovered flints dating from the [[Neolithic|New Stone Age]]. Amongst the finds in the area were [[flint]] cores and a flint scraper, which had been retouched with a knife. The presence of flint cores suggest that the site was used for tool manufacture and that a settlement was nearby. Additionally, a Bronze Age burnt mound was also discovered in the area.<ref>{{cite web|last=Dargue |first=William |title=Fox Hollies, Sutton Coldfield |url=http://billdargue.jimdo.com/placenames-gazetteer-a-to-y/places-f/fox-hollies-sutton-coldfield/ |work=A History of Birmingham Places & Placenames . . .  from A to Y |accessdate=13 September 2010}}</ref>

In his ''History of Birmingham'', published in 1782, [[William Hutton (historian)|William Hutton]] describes the presence of three mounds adjacent to Chester Road on the extremities of Sutton Coldfield (although now outside the modern boundaries of the town).<ref name="whutton">{{cite book|last=Hutton |first=William |title=The History of Birmingham |year=1782 |pages=476–7 |authorlink=William Hutton (historian)}}</ref> The site, southwest of Bourne Pool (named "Bowen Pool" by Hutton<ref name="whutton" />), is called Loaches Banks and was mapped as early as 1752 by Dr. Wilks of [[Willenhall]]. Hutton interpreted the earthworks as a Saxon fortification but further archaeological work led Dr. Mike Hodder, now the Planning Archaeologist for Birmingham City Council, to believe that the site was an Iron Age hill-slope enclosure. Centuries of agriculture on the land has severely affected the visibility of the features, with the earthworks now only apparent in aerial photography.<ref>{{cite web |last=Balsom |first=Bryan |title=The Heritage Trail at Bourne Brook and Pool |url=http://www.wmwheat.co.uk/docs/bourne/bourne_pool.pdf |publisher=Wm Wheat & Son |accessdate=13 September 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120312213229/http://www.wmwheat.co.uk/docs/bourne/bourne_pool.pdf |archive-date=12 March 2012 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}</ref>

Further evidence of pre-Roman human habitation are preserved in [[Sutton Park, West Midlands|Sutton Park]]. A major fire in the park in 1926 revealed six more mounds near Streetly Lane, excavations of which uncovered charred and cracked stones within them and pits below the two largest mounds.<ref name="SPA1" /> Although their date of origin is unknown, claims they were of Bronze Age origin were disproved.<ref>{{cite book|last=Chinn|first=Carl|title=Birmingham: Bibliography of a City|year=2003|publisher=University of Birmingham Press |isbn=1-902459-24-5|page=15}}</ref> The mounds are now covered in rough heathland.<ref name="lhi">{{cite web|title=Walking in their Footsteps |url=http://www.lhi.org.uk/docs/Walking_in_their_Footsteps.pdf |publisher=Local History Initiative |accessdate=4 November 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110613220853/http://www.lhi.org.uk/docs/Walking_in_their_Footsteps.pdf |archivedate=13 June 2011 |df=dmy }}</ref> The area around Rowton's Well has been the source of many archaeological discoveries such as flint tools, and in the 18th century, worked timbers were discovered near the well, suggesting a possible Iron Age timber [[trackway]] built across wet land, similar to others discovered elsewhere in the country.<ref name="SPA1">{{cite web|title=Sutton Park: Archaeology 1 |url=http://www.birmingham.gov.uk/cs/Satellite?c=Page&childpagename=Parks-Ranger-Service/PageLayout&cid=1223092737663&pagename=BCC/Common/Wrapper/Wrapper |publisher=Birmingham City Council |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110830035728/http://www.birmingham.gov.uk/cs/Satellite?c=Page&childpagename=Parks-Ranger-Service%2FPageLayout&cid=1223092737663&pagename=BCC%2FCommon%2FWrapper%2FWrapper |archivedate=30 August 2011 }}</ref> A burnt mound was also discovered in [[New Hall Valley]].<ref>{{cite web|title=The Historical Valley |url=http://www.newhallvalleycountrypark.org/the_valley.html |publisher=New Hall Valley Country Park |accessdate=13 September 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716071847/http://www.newhallvalleycountrypark.org/the_valley.html |archivedate=16 July 2011 }}</ref>

=== Roman period ===
The presence of [[Roman Britain|Romans]] in the area is most visible in Sutton Park, where a {{convert|1.5|mi|km|adj=on}} long preserved section of [[Icknield Street]] passes through. Whilst the road ultimately connects Gloucestershire to South Yorkshire, locally, the road was important for connecting [[Metchley Fort]] in [[Edgbaston]] with [[Letocetum]], now [[Wall, Staffordshire|Wall]], in [[Staffordshire]]. The road is most visible from near to the pedestrian gate on Thornhill Road (OS Grid Reference SP 08759 98830), where the {{convert|8|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} wide bank that formed the road surface is most prominent. Excavations at the road have showed that it was made from compacted gravel, never having a paved surface. Along each side are intermittent ditches, marked by Roman engineers, and beyond these are hollows where gravel was excavated to make the road surface.<ref name="SPA1" /> At least three Roman coins have been found along the course of Icknield Street through Sutton Park,<ref>{{cite web|title=Continuity And Discontinuity in The Landscape: Roman to Medieval in Sutton Chase |url=http://ads.ahds.ac.uk/catalogue/adsdata/arch-769-1/ahds/dissemination/pdf/vol36/36_178_182.pdf |publisher=Arts and Humanities Data Service |accessdate=13 September 2010|format=PDF}}</ref> as well as a Roman pottery kiln elsewhere in the town.<ref>{{cite web|title=Roman Birmingham |url=http://www.birmingham.gov.uk/cs/Satellite?c=Page&childpagename=Planning-Management/PageLayout&cid=1223092741307&pagename=BCC/Common/Wrapper/Wrapper&rendermode=Live |publisher=Birmingham City Council |accessdate=13 September 2010}}</ref>

Next to the Iron Age property at Langley Brook, the remains of a timber building and field system were discovered. Pottery recovered from this site was dated to the 2nd and 3rd century, indicating the presence of a Roman farmstead.<ref name="M6TA" />

=== Anglo-Saxon establishment, c. 600–1135 ===
Upon the [[End of Roman rule in Britain|Roman withdrawal from Britain]] to protect the [[Roman Empire]] on the continent in the 5th century, the area of Sutton Coldfield, still undeveloped, passed into the [[Anglo Saxon]] kingdom of [[Mercia]]. It is during this period that it is believed Sutton Coldfield may have originated as a [[hamlet (place)|hamlet]], as a [[hunting lodge]] was built at Maney Hill for the purpose of the Mercian leaders.<ref name="Bracken10">{{cite book|last=Bracken |first=L. |title=History of the forest and chase of Sutton Coldfield |year=1860 |publisher=Benjamin Hall|page=10}}</ref> The outline of the deer park that it served is still visible within Sutton Park, with the ditch and bank boundary forming the western boundary of Holly Hurst, then crossing Keepers Valley, through the Lower Nuthurst and continuing on south of Blackroot Pool. Due to the marshy ground at Blackroot Valley, a fence was probably constructed to contain the deer, and the ditch and bank boundary commences again on the eastern side, on towards Holly Knoll.<ref name="lhi" />

This became known as Southun or Sutton; "ton" meaning townstead to the south of [[Tamworth, Staffordshire|Tamworth]], the capital of Mercia. [[Middleton, Warwickshire|Middleton]] is situated between the two. "Coldfield" denotes an area of land on the side of hill, that is exposed to the weather. It may also denote a place where [[charcoal]] burning took place. {{Citation needed|date=June 2017}}

Sutone, as the manor became known, was held by [[Edwin, Earl of Mercia]] during the reign of [[Edward the Confessor]]. Upon the death of Edwin in 1071, the manor and the rest of Mercia passed into the possession of the Crown, then ruled by [[William the Conqueror]], resulting in Sutton Chase becoming a [[Royal Forest]].<ref name="Salzman">{{cite book|last=Salzman |first=L.

The manor of Sutone was mentioned in the [[Domesday Book]] of 1086, where it was rated at eight [[Hide (unit)|hides]], making it larger than all surrounding villages in terms of cultivated land.<ref name="DargueSC">{{cite web|last=Dargue |first=William |title=Sutton/ Sutton Coldfield |url=http://billdargue.jimdo.com/placenames-gazetteer-a-to-y/places-s/sutton-coldfield/ |work=A History of Birmingham Places & Placenames . . .  from A to Y |accessdate=13 September 2010}}</ref>

=== Early development, c. 1135–1499 ===

==== Possession of the manor ====
The manor remained in the possession of the Crown until 1135,<ref name="DargueSC" /> when [[Henry I of England|King Henry I]] exchanged it for the manors of [[Oakham|Hockham]] and [[Langham, Rutland|Langham]] in [[Rutland]], with [[Roger de Beaumont, 2nd Earl of Warwick]].<ref name="Salzman" /> The manor remained in the possession of the earldom of Warwick for around 300 years, with numerous exceptions.<ref name="DargueSC" /> As Sutton Forest was no longer in the possession of the Crown, it became Sutton Chase.

In 1242, when the manor was passed to Ela Longespee, the widow of [[Thomas de Beaumont, 6th Earl of Warwick]], it was named as Sutton-in-Coldfield, and again noted as such in 1265 when Ela married her second husband [[Philip Basset]]. The manor of Sutton-in-Coldfield was once again in the possession of the earldom of Warwick when Ela exchanged it with [[William de Beauchamp, 9th Earl of Warwick]] for the manor of Spilsbury in [[Oxfordshire]].<ref name="Salzman" /> The first mention of a manor house attached to the manor of Sutton was mentioned in 1315 on a site named Manor Hill, west of the parish church.<ref name="Salzman" />

During the 15th century, Sutton Coldfield underwent a process of change due in part to the turbulent ongoings with the Earls of Warwick and their possession of the manor house. In 1397, [[Thomas de Beauchamp, 12th Earl of Warwick]], was punished by King [[Richard II of England|Richard II]] for being a member of the [[Lords Appellant]]. All his possessions were confiscated, including the land at Sutton which was transferred to [[Thomas Holland, 1st Duke of Surrey|Thomas Holland]], 3rd [[Earl of Kent]]. Upon King Richard II's death in 1400, Thomas de Beauchamp was returned his possessions although he died the following year. In 1446, [[Henry de Beauchamp, 1st Duke of Warwick|Henry de Beauchamp, 14th Earl of Warwick]] died and the earldom was passed to his two-year-old daughter [[Anne de Beauchamp, 15th Countess of Warwick|Anne]], however King [[Henry VI of England|Henry VI]] collected the profits of the land whilst Anne was in her infancy. Anne died in 1448, and the estate and earldom passed to her aunt [[Anne Neville, 16th Countess of Warwick|Anne Neville]], although this was contested by her three older half-sisters. In his ''Itinerary'', [[John Leland (antiquary)|John Leland]] mentions that [[Richard Neville, 16th Earl of Warwick]] and his wife Anne Neville, are believed to have built a new manor of timber-frame construction, with a lease given by King Henry VI in 1460 to Edward Mountfort suggesting that the manor was then occupied by the Mountfort family.<ref name="Salzman" />

Despite being occupied by Mountfort family, Richard Neville regained his power and land, but died in 1471. Normally, the land would have remained in the possession of his wife but instead they were given to his two daughters and their husbands. However, the eldest daughter, Isabella, contested and obtained the remainder of the interests from her sister. Isabella died in 1476, leaving the manor in the possession of her husband, [[George Plantagenet, 1st Duke of Clarence]]. However, in 1478, he was [[attainder|attainted]] and executed, meaning that the manor was passed to his only surviving son [[Edward Plantagenet, 17th Earl of Warwick|Edward Plantagenet]], who was still an infant. The Crown held the lands due to Edward's age but in 1487, granted the lands back to [[Anne Neville, 16th Countess of Warwick]] since both her daughters were now dead. She immediately gave the lands back, however she was given Sutton and other manors back to her in 1489. She died in 1492, with all the land returning to the possession of the Crown, with whom it remained until it was incorporated in 1528.<ref name="Salzman" />

==== Growth and military influence ====
The manor of Sutton was not the only manor house within Sutton, as the [[Langley Hall, West Midlands|manor of Langley]] was noted as being in the possession of the de Bereford family of Wishaw as early as the mid-13th century. [[New Hall Manor]] is said to date to the 13th century also, and was mentioned in 1327 as being passed from William de Sutton to Robert de Sutton. It is believed to have originally been a hunting lodge. In 1281, [[Peddimore Hall]] was first mentioned when it was sold to Hugh de Vienna by Thomas de Arden. It is presumed that the land was given to the Arden family by one of the Earls of Warwick.<ref name="Salzman" />

It is not known exactly when the village of Sutton began to develop but in 1300, [[Guy de Beauchamp, 10th Earl of Warwick]], was granted a [[charter]] by King [[Edward I of England|Edward I]] to hold a [[market (place)|market]] on each Tuesday and an annual fair on the eve of Holy Trinity in the village. Sutton did not establish itself as a [[market town]] like [[Birmingham]] was able to, and the market appears to have fallen out of use as a new charter was granted to [[Thomas de Beauchamp, 11th Earl of Warwick]] for a market to be held on the same day, as well as fairs on the eve of Holy Trinity and also on the eve of St Martin.<ref name="Salzman" />

During the 12th and 13th centuries, religious activities were carried out at the free chapel of [[Saint Blaise]], constructed within the Sutton manor grounds. In the late 1200s, the town constructed its own parish church, the first incumbent of which was ordained in 1305. This later became [[Holy Trinity Church, Sutton Coldfield|Holy Trinity Church]], and the only remaining features of the original church survive below the east window, where clasping buttresses are visible, a method of construction from the mid-13th century.<ref>{{cite web|title=History |url=http://www.htsc.org.uk/history.html |publisher=Holy Trinity Parish Church |accessdate=13 September 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100618052331/http://www.htsc.org.uk/history.html |archivedate=18 June 2010 }}</ref>

Throughout the 15th century, Sutton Coldfield developed a military connection, due in part to Sir [[Ralph Bracebridge]] who obtained a lease for his lifetime from the Earl of Warwick for the Manor and Chase of Sutton Coldfield. In return, Bracebridge was required to assist the Earl with nine lancers and seventeen archers in strengthening [[Calais]] from French attack.<ref name="Bracken45">{{cite book|last=Bracken |first=L. |title=History of the forest and chase of Sutton Coldfield |year=1860 |publisher=Benjamin Hall|pages=45–6}}</ref> As a result, Sutton Coldfield became an important training location for English soldiers during the wars between [[England]] and [[France]]. [[Archery butts|Butts]] were assembled within the town for archery training, and marks can still be seen in the sandstone wall on 3 Coleshill Street where archers sharpened their arrows. It is believed that 3 Coleshill Street is of medieval origin despite having a Georgian façade. Bracebridge is remembered as having dammed [[Plants Brook|Ebrook]] to form Bracebridge Pool, now in Sutton Park, which he used for fishing.<ref name="Bracken52">{{cite book|last=Bracken |first=L. |title=History of the forest and chase of Sutton Coldfield |year=1860 |publisher=Benjamin Hall|page=52}}</ref>

=== Tudor Sutton Coldfield, c. 1500–1598 ===

==== Influence of Bishop Vesey ====
By the beginning of the 16th century, the town of Sutton Coldfield had started to decay as a result of the [[War of the Roses]]. The markets had been abandoned and the manor house itself was becoming dilapidated. Around 1510, the manor house was demolished by an officer to the Crown, who sold the timbers for a profit to [[Thomas Grey, 2nd Marquess of Dorset]], who used them in the construction of [[Bradgate Park|Bradgate House]] in [[Leicestershire]].<ref name="Bracken51">{{cite book|last=Bracken |first=L. |title=History of the forest and chase of Sutton Coldfield |year=1860 |publisher=Benjamin Hall|pages=51–52}}</ref> It was during the period of decay that John Harman grew up, working at Moor Hall Farm in Sutton and then studying at [[Magdalen College, Oxford]]. He formed a friendship with [[Thomas Wolsey]] and started a career in the church, beginning with his appointment as chaplain at the free chapel of St. Blaize in his hometown in 1495.<ref name="Bracken57">{{cite book|last=Bracken |first=L. |title=History of the forest and chase of Sutton Coldfield |year=1860 |publisher=Benjamin Hall|pages=57–65}}</ref> Harman continued to be promoted and became Chaplain to [[Henry VIII of England|King Henry VIII]], with whom he became friends. In 1519, Harman was appointed [[Bishop of Exeter]] and changed his surname to Vesey, thus becoming [[John Vesey]].

It was Vesey's respected position within the church and his friendship with the King that set about the start of a revival for Sutton Coldfield, spearheaded by Vesey. He had returned to the town in 1524 for the funeral of his mother to discover the town had further deteriorated. He decided to set up residence in the town again and in 1527 obtained two enclosures of land named Moor Yards and Heath Crofts, as well as {{convert|40|acre|m2}} of land for him to construct his own home named Moor Hall. In the same year, he established a grammar school in the southwest corner of the parish churchyard, where 21 people were appointed Trustees to maintain the building and employ a teacher. On 16 December 1528, through the interests of Vesey, Henry VIII granted Sutton Coldfield a [[Royal charter|Charter of Incorporation]], creating a new form of government for the town which was named the Warden and Society of the Royal Town of Sutton Coldfield.<ref name="Salzman" /> The society consisted of 25 of the most prominent local inhabitants who elected a new Warden from within them. Vesey's brother-in-law, William Gibbons, became the first Warden.<ref name="Salzman" /> All the town's inhabitants over the age of 22 were permitted to elect members to the Society.<ref>{{cite book|last=Weinbaum |first=Martin |title=British Borough Charters 1307-1660 |year=2010 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=1-108-01035-0 |page=118 }}</ref> The charter had also given the inhabitants permission to hunt and fish freely in the manor grounds, as well as build a house, enclosing up to {{convert|60|acre|ha|0}}, within the manor grounds.<ref name="Salzman" /> Throughout the length of the Society's existence, it was dogged by claims of corruption and malpractice from the town's residents.<ref name="Salzman" />

The donation by King Henry VIII of his hunting land to the residents of the town set the foundations for the preservation of the area now known as [[Sutton Park, West Midlands|Sutton Park]]. Vesey cleared large tracts of the land of trees to allow residents to graze their cattle there for a small fee. He then enclosed wooded areas within the land, added gates and fencing around the park, and then arranged for the transfer of horses to the park at his own expense. Bishop Vesey also paid for the whole town to be paved, which in turn helped revive the markets. In 1527, he set about working on Holy Trinity Church, donating an organ in 1530 and then paying for the construction of two new aisles in 1533. In 1540, he approved the transfer of control of the grammar school to the Warden and Society, and gave the school land for its own use the following year. To help expand the town and protect its extremities, he constructed 51 cottages for the poor, including one at Cotty's Moor which was a hotspot for robberies of people using the roads. The stone walls of the former manor house were removed to assist in the construction of a bridge at [[Water Orton]] and another in [[Curdworth]], at his own expense. In 1547, he purchased from the Bishop of Coventry and Lichfield, and in 1549, from the Crown, numerous church properties including the chantry lands of Sutton Coldfield, and those in [[Deritend]], Birmingham, before dying at Moor Hall in 1555.<ref name="Bracken57" /> Vesey's legacy is clearly visible today, with Sutton Park largely unchanged since its enclosure, some stone cottages remaining, and the grammar school he established still operating under the name of [[Bishop Vesey's Grammar School]]. His tomb at Holy Trinity Church is accompanied by memorial gardens to the west of the church named Vesey Gardens.

Moor Hall, Bishop Vesey's residence, was inherited by his nephew John Harman after Vesey's death. He sold the mansion to John Richardson, who died in 1584 leaving an infant son.<ref name="Salzman" /> A manor by the name of Pool Hall is first mentioned as being in the town in 1581, and in the following year, William Charnells leased it for 20 years to Henry Goodere, who transferred the rights to [[John Aylmer (bishop)|John Aylmer]], Bishop of London, in 1583. Upon the Aylmer's death in 1594, the manor was passed on to his sons, who sold it to Robert Burdett in 1598.<ref name="Salzman" /> It is believed that the properties at 62 and 64 Birmingham Road were constructed around 1530, making it one of the oldest surviving buildings in the town.<ref>{{IoE|216547|accessdate=14 September 2010}}</ref> Nearby 68 Birmingham Road dates to the end of the 1500s.<ref>{{IoE|473073|accessdate=14 September 2010}}</ref>

==== Emergence of industry ====
During the 16th century, the waters and pools within Sutton were exploited for industrial purposes and following the death of Vesey, the town continued to prosper and expand. In 1510, two watermills under the ownership of William Weston were recorded, and upon the establishment of the park, he was forced to pay rent on them. Three other mills were recorded in 1576, after they were sold to two unnamed local men. In 1585, John Bull sold a water-fulling mill and two blade-mills, which would have been powered by water, to Edward Sprott. Four additional mills were recorded in 1588, and another two in 1595.<ref name="Salzman" /> A blade mill was constructed at Bracebridge Pool in 1597, on a site now occupied by Park House.<ref name="lhi" /> Despite the growth of industry here, five pools in total were drained in the 16th century, although some were recreated later including Bracebridge Pool and Keeper's Pool.<ref name="Salzman" />

=== 17th and 18th centuries ===

==== Civil war, unrest and governance ====
The outbreak of the [[English Civil War]] in 1642 saw the [[Battle of Camp Hill]] at nearby Birmingham, which resulted in Birmingham being pillaged by Royalist forces. Despite the nearby action, Sutton Coldfield emerged unscathed, although it is known that it was visited by both Parliamentary and Royalist soldiers.<ref>{{cite book|last=Amphlett |first=John |title=A Short History of Clent |year=2009 |publisher=BiblioBazaar |isbn=1-103-20118-2|page=124 }}</ref> It is claimed that during his escape from England in 1646, [[Charles II of England|Charles II]] stayed for a night at [[New Hall Manor]].<ref>{{cite web|title=A History of New Hall |url=http://www.handpickedhotels.co.uk/hotels/new-hall-hotel/History/ |publisher=Handpicked Hotels |accessdate=14 September 2010|quote=...it is said that Charles II stayed one night at New Hall during his flight from England...}}</ref>

On 26 July 1664, King Charles II renewed the royal charter for Sutton Coldfield, with the additional provision being made for the appointment of two members of the Society as capital [[Burgess (title)|burgesses]] and also as [[Justice of the peace|justices of the peace]] alongside the Warden.<ref name="Salzman" /><ref>{{cite book|title=The charters of the royal town of Sutton Coldfield |year=1853 |publisher=Benjamin Hall |pages=29–38 |author=Warden and Society of the Royal Town of Sutton Coldfield }}</ref>

Following his trial and three-year suspension from preaching, the violently [[English Presbyterianism|anti-Presbyterian]] [[Henry Sacheverell]] retired to New Hall, the home of his once removed first cousin, George Sacheverell.<ref name="WKRB13" />  [[Henry Sacheverell]] preached a vitriolic sermon at Sutton Church on Sunday 17 October 1714, which fuelled [[Birmingham|Birmingham’s]] contribution to the nationwide rioting the following Wednesday, the day of [[King George I of Great Britain|King George I's]] coronation.  It also appears that, whilst residing in New Hall, he helped ferment the [[English Presbyterianism|anti-Presbyterian]] "Church in danger" riots of July 1715, when, according to a correspondent of [[George Berkeley]], up to 4000 rioters gathered in Birmingham, twenty-eight rioters died, and no more than three [[English Dissenters|Dissenters’]] meeting-houses survived in [[Birmingham]], [[Worcestershire]] and [[Staffordshire]].<ref>Gilmour, Ian; Riot, risings and revolution (London, 1992); {{ISBN|0091753309}}.</ref>  The town became a temporary refuge in 1791, following the "[[Priestley Riots]]" in Birmingham. [[William Hutton (Birmingham historian)|William Hutton]], for example, whose house was attacked by protesters, decided to spend the summer in Sutton. However, local residents' fears of further rioting, forced him to move permanently to [[Tamworth, Staffordshire|Tamworth]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Hutton |first=William |title=The life of William Hutton, stationer, of Birmingham, and the history of his family |year=1841 |publisher=Charles Knight & Co. |pages=58–59 |authorlink=William Hutton (Birmingham historian)}}</ref> [[Joseph Priestley]] is said to have stayed at the 'Three Tuns' following the destruction of his home in the [[Priestley riots|riots]], and his initial flight to Heath-forge, [[Wombourne]].<ref name="DargueSC" />

==== Industrial growth ====
The manufacture of blades, gun barrels, spades and spade handles as well as the grinding of knives, bayonets and axes, mainly at mills constructed at pools in Sutton Park and on the banks of Ebrook, became an important contributor to the town's economy in the 17th century. The blade mill at Bracebridge Pool fell out of use by 1678 and was destroyed, however, it was reconstructed by 1729.<ref name="lhi" /> The creation of Longmoor Pool, caused by the damming of Longmoor Brook in Longmoor Valley, was approved in 1733 and carried about by John Riland, who built a mill there in 1754 with his co-tenant<ref name="Salzman" /> for the manufacture of buttons.<ref name="SCNHC">{{cite web|last=Coxhead |first=Peter |title=The Pools of Sutton Park |url=http://www.sp.scnhs.org.uk/lakes.html |publisher=Sutton Coldfield Natural History Society |accessdate=14 September 2010}}</ref> Blackroot Pool was also constructed in around 1757 by Edward Homer and Joseph Duncomb. In 1772, the Warden and Society of the town gave a lease of 30 years to Thomas Ingram at the pool.<ref name="Salzman" /> The mill at Blackroot Pool was originally used for leather dressing, although later became a [[sawmill]].<ref name="SCNHC" />

Powell's Pool was created in 1730 as a millpond for Powell's Pool Mill, a steel-rolling mill.<ref>{{cite web |title=Sutton Park |url=http://www.brumagem.co.uk/ae_Sutton-Park_Birmingham.htm |publisher=Brumagem |accessdate=14 September 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110911082554/http://www.brumagem.co.uk/ae_Sutton-Park_Birmingham.htm |archivedate=11 September 2011 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> In 1733, a cotton spinning machine was tested at the mill by [[John Wyatt (inventor)|John Wyatt]] with the help of [[Lewis Paul]], helping to kickstart the creation of the UK's cotton industry in the 18th century.<ref name="Newcomen">{{cite book|title=The Newcomen bulletin |year=1984 |publisher=Newcomen Society for the Study of the History of Engineering and Technology |page=28|url=https://books.google.com/books?ei=JuSPTLGeK4jo4AbFm4WyDg&ct=result&id=KpYoAQAAIAAJ |accessdate=14 September 2010}}</ref> In total, Sutton Coldfield has had 15 watermills, 13 of which were powered by Plants Brook, and the remaining two using an independent water supply.

A heavy storm caused the collapse of the dam holding back the waters of Wyndley Pool,<ref>{{cite web|title=For 60 years after the Norman Conquest, Sutton Coldfield was a royal manor|url=http://www.thisissuttoncoldfield.co.uk/news/Times-NR-42pt-headline-heady/article-2470869-detail/article.html |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130505073137/http://www.thisissuttoncoldfield.co.uk/news/Times-NR-42pt-headline-heady/article-2470869-detail/article.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=5 May 2013 |publisher=''Sutton Coldfield Observer'' (republished by thisissuttoncoldfield.co.uk)|accessdate=14 September 2010}}</ref> which subsequently swept downstream and broke the banks of Mill Pool at Mill Street in July 1668, subsequently flooding and destroying many homes within Sutton Coldfield.<ref name="WKRB13">{{cite book|last=Riland-Bedford |first=William Kirkpatrick |authorlink=William Kirkpatrick Riland Bedford |title=Three Hundred Years of a Family Living; Being a History of the Rilands of Sutton Coldfield |origyear=1889 |year= 2009 |publisher=General Books |isbn=1-150-13395-3 |page=13}}</ref> Bracebridge Pool also broke its banks as a result of the storm on 24 July, causing lesser damage. Wyndley Pool was subsequently drained, although there is another pool within Sutton Park with the same name.<ref name="DargueSC" />

Much of the damming in Sutton Coldfield was carried out using stone and gravel quarried from within the town. These quarries also supplied stone for construction elsewhere in the town, proving to be particularly profitable. The quarry that supplied material for the construction of Blackroot Pool in 1759 was in use until 1914.<ref name="lhi" />

==== Financial prosperity and town growth ====
During the 17th and 18th centuries, the town prospered from the growth of industry and this led to improvements in the quality of life for the residents. They were now able to experience new luxuries such as seafood. Products were 10% more expensive in Sutton Coldfield than in neighbouring towns and villages. The town also grew, due in part to the wealthy industrialists of Birmingham seeing Sutton Coldfield as a suitable location for their country houses, away from the pollution of the larger town.<ref name="Beresford">{{cite book|last=Beresford |first=Maurice |title=Time and Place: collected essays |year=1985 |publisher=Continuum International Publishing Group |isbn=0-907628-39-7|page=100}}</ref> A survey of the parish in 1630 reported that there were 298 houses, and this number had increased to 310 when another survey was conducted in 1698.<ref name="WKRB12">{{cite book|last=Riland-Bedford |first=William Kirkpatrick |title=Three Hundred Years of a Family Living; Being a History of the Rilands of Sutton Coldfield |origyear=1889 |year=2009 |publisher=General Books |isbn=1-150-13395-3 |page=12}}</ref> Of these houses would have been 20 High Street, which was built around 1675.<ref>{{IoE|216577|accessdate=14 September 2010}}</ref> A survey of the parish in 1721 noted that the number of houses in Sutton Coldfield had increased to 360.<ref name="WKRB12" /> In 1636, [[Charles I of England|King Charles I]] imposed the [[ship money]] tax of £80 on the town, compared to £100 for Birmingham and Warwick, £266 for Coventry, and £50 for Stafford, reflecting the wealth of the town at the time.<ref>{{cite book|last=Yates |first=George |title=An Historical and Descriptive Sketch of Birmingham |year=1830 |publisher=Beilby, Knott, and Beilby |page=24}}</ref> In 1663, an Act was passed to order and collect "Hearth Duty", which led to a subsequent survey of all houses in the country and the noting of all properties with hearths and stoves.

Some of Sutton Coldfield's most prominent buildings were constructed or underwent changes during this time. For example, the current [[Peddimore Hall]] was constructed in 1659 by William Wood to a design by [[William Wilson (architect)|William Wilson]], who took up residence in the town and married the widowed landowner, Jane Pudsey, in 1681.<ref>{{cite book|last=Jones |first=Douglas V. |title=Walmley and its surroundings |year=1990 |publisher=Westwood Press |isbn=0-948025-11-5 |chapter=Chapter III: Langley, Wishaw and Moxhull}}</ref> Her daughters disapproved of the relationship and she was forced out of her home at Langley Hall, resulting in Wilson constructing [[Moat House, Sutton Coldfield|Moat House]] for the couple in 1680.<ref>{{cite book|last=Noszlopy |first=George Thomas |title=Public sculpture of Warwickshire, Coventry and Solihull |year=2003 |publisher=Liverpool University Press |isbn=0-85323-847-2 |page=273}}</ref> Another of his works in the town was Four Oaks Hall, designed for [[Henry Folliott, 1st Baron Folliott]], who was the husband of Wilson's stepdaughter.

In 1610, New Hall Manor was purchased by Henry Sacheverell, the family of which were prominent landowners throughout the country. Upon his death in 1620, the hall was inherited first by Valence Sacheverell, and then by George Sacheverell, his eldest son.<ref name="Salzman" /> Notable buildings that were constructed in the town during the 18th century include the Royal Hotel on High Street, which dates to circa 1750.<ref name="DargueSC" /><ref>{{IoE|216591|accessdate=14 September 2010}}</ref> The 'Three Tuns' public house, also on High Street, dates to the late 18th century although retains the cellars and foundations of an earlier building.<ref>{{IoE|216590|accessdate=14 September 2010}}</ref>

=== The commuter town, 1800–1900 ===

==== Municipal projects and change of government ====
The 1800s would prove to be another century of major change for the town, built upon the wealth it had generated in years before and the power that the Sutton Coldfield Corporation had. Dealing with a growing town, they sought to improve the quality of life for residents. The Corporation were forced to fell trees within the town and sell the timber as means to fund the construction of schools and almshouses. In 1826, timber worth £1,116 3s. was sold.<ref name="Salzman" /> The first of these schools were founded during the 1820s. The Corporation also constructed two [[almshouse]]s in Walmley in 1828 and a further two adjacent in 1863.<ref>{{cite book|last=Jones |first=Douglas V. |title=Walmley and its surroundings |year=1990 |publisher=Westwood Press |isbn=0-948025-11-5}}</ref> By 1837, there were ten almshouses in the parish under the ownership of the Corporation, with others operated by charities.<ref>{{cite book|last=Wright |first=George |title=A New and Comprehensive Gazetteer, Volume 4 |year=1837 |publisher=T. Kelly |page=567 |location=Paternoster Row, London}}</ref>

In 1849, the original royal charters were sent to London to be translated from Latin as a result of the skins on which they were written beginning to deteriorate.

The town hall at the top of Mill Street began to deteriorate throughout the 1800s and the decision was taken to demolish it in 1854. The adjacent workhouse and gaol were renovated to become the new municipal offices, and this was reconstructed in 1858 until 1859 to better suit its purpose. The new offices were designed by G. Bidlake.<ref name="freemason">{{cite web|title=SUTTON COLDFIELD MASONIC HALL - A BRIEF HISTORY |url=http://www.suttoncoldfieldfreemasons.org.uk/ |publisher=The Sutton Coldfield Masonic Hall Company Ltd. |accessdate=6 November 2010}}</ref> A fire station was also constructed further down Mill Street.<ref name="freemason" />

During the 1830s, municipal corporations were investigated due to corrupt practices within the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]]. These inquiries led to the passing of the [[Reform Act 1832|Reform Act of 1832]] and [[Municipal Corporations Act 1835|Municipal Corporations Act of 1835]] which reformed boroughs nationwide. Despite the radical changes imposed by the Acts, the Sutton Coldfield Corporation was left untouched.<ref name="Beresford" /> It was not until April 1882, as a result of the [[Municipal Corporations Act 1882|Municipal Corporations Act of 1882]], that Sutton Coldfield became a municipal borough. The old Corporation was replaced with a new structure consisting of a mayor, six aldermen and eighteen elected councillors. Six wards were created in the borough - Holy Trinity, Hill, Boldmere, Wylde Green, Maney, and Walmley - from which three councillors were elected.<ref name="Salzman" />

==== Arrival of the railways ====
For the majority of the 19th century, people travelled between Birmingham and Sutton Coldfield by horse-drawn carriage, a journey that took around 80 minutes.<ref name="freemason" /> Birmingham received its first railway in 1837 with a terminus at Vauxhall station, now [[Duddeston railway station]]. In 1859, an Act was passed for the construction of a railway line connecting Birmingham to Sutton Coldfield via Erdington.<ref>{{cite book|title=General Report of the Board of Trade on the Railway and Canal Bills of Session 1859|year=1859 |publisher=Board of Trade |page=52 }}</ref> Construction commenced in 1860 on the line which passed through Vauxhall station, although by this time it was being used only as a goods station. The line opened on 2 June 1862 with [[Sutton Coldfield railway station]] being the terminus. An Act of Parliament for the continuation of the railway to [[Lichfield]] was passed on 23 June 1874, with construction starting in October 1881<ref name="showell" /> and services beginning in 1884.<ref>{{cite web|title=Lichfield City Station |url=http://www.railaroundbirmingham.co.uk/Stations/lichfield_city.php |work=Rail Around Birmingham and the West Midlands |accessdate=6 November 2010}}</ref> The line was extended to [[Lichfield Trent Valley railway station]] on 28 November 1888.<ref>{{cite book |last=Butt |first=R.V.J. |title=The Directory of Railway Stations |year=1995 |publisher=Patrick Stephens Ltd |location=Yeovil |isbn=1-85260-508-1 |page=142}}</ref>

A proposed second railway line by the Wolverhampton, Walsall and Midland Junction Railway Company through Sutton Coldfield was met with opposition from residents who were concerned about the route cutting through Sutton Park. A meeting objecting to the proposal was held on 15 April 1872,<ref name="showell" /> however, construction was authorised on 6 August in the same year. The WWMJR company merged with [[Midland Railway]] in 1874 and construction commenced soon after. To calm objections from residents, Midland Railway promised cheap local coal and paid £6,500 for a {{convert|2|mi|km|adj=on}} stretch through Sutton Park.<ref name="wr">{{cite web|title=LMS Route: Water Orton to Walsall |url=http://www.warwickshirerailways.com/lms/waterortonwalsall.htm |publisher=Warwickshire Railways |accessdate=6 November 2010}}</ref> Services on the line began on 1 July 1879, with trains stopping at [[Penns railway station|Penns (Walmley)]], [[Sutton Coldfield Town railway station|Sutton Coldfield Town]], and [[Sutton Park railway station|Sutton Park]] in the town, as well as at [[Streetly railway station|Streetly]], [[Aldridge railway station|Aldridge]], and [[Walsall railway station|Walsall]]. Ultimately, the line connected the Midland Railway's [[Wolverhampton and Walsall Railway]] line to their [[Birmingham and Derby Junction Railway|Birmingham to Derby line]].<ref name="wr" />

The railways quickly led to Sutton Coldfield becoming a popular location for day excursions and picnic parties for the residents of Birmingham, escaping the pollution of the city for the landscapes of Sutton Park.<ref>{{cite book|last=McCulla|first=Dorothy |title=Victorian and Edwardian Warwickshire: from old photographs |year=1976 |publisher=B. T. Batsford |isbn=0-7134-3101-6|page=112 }}</ref> The 1863 edition of [[Bradshaw's Guide]] described Sutton Coldfield as "a place of no very particular note, beyond an occaisional pic-nic excursion".<ref name=Bradshaw>{{cite book|last=Bradshaw|title=Bradshaw's Descriptive Railway Hand-book of Great Britain and Ireland|year=1863|publisher=Old House|location=Oxford|isbn=9781908402028|pages=Section III, Page 21}}</ref>  In the [[Whit week]] of 1882, 19,549 people visited Sutton Park, with numbers dropping to 11,378 in the same week the following year. In 1884, there were 17,486 visitors, of whom 14,000 went on the Monday.<ref name="showell" /> In 1865, on a small eminence adjacent to Sutton Coldfield station, the Royal Hotel was constructed, hoping to capitalise on the new tourist industry the town was witnessing. The hotel was beset with financial difficulties and closed down in 1895, becoming Sutton Coldfield Sanatorium for a short period of time.<ref name="DVJCH" />

As well as becoming a tourist spot, Sutton Coldfield also developed into a [[commuter town]] to Birmingham, as workers were able to live away from the pollution of the city and travel there by train.<ref>{{cite book|last=Simmons |first=Jack |title=The Railway in England and Wales, 1830–1914 |year=1978 |publisher=Leicester University Press |isbn=0-7185-1146-8|page=101 }}</ref> During the late 19th century, it was the wealthy manufacturers who moved to Sutton Coldfield, and it was not until the turn of the century that ordinary workers were able to move as well.<ref name="Beresford" />

In 1836, [[George Bodington]] acquired an asylum and sanatorium at Driffold House (now the Empire cinema), Maney where he researched pulmonary disease.

==== Population growth and public facilities ====
The first census of Sutton Coldfield took place in 1801. It recorded that the town had a population of 2,847. The following census of 1811 recorded that this had risen to 2,959 with 617 houses. This was partially down to the construction of barracks to the east to accommodate the Edinburgh and Sussex Militias, the 7th Dragoon Guards and a Brigade of Artillery. By 1821, the population had further increased to 3,426<ref>{{cite book|last=Smith |first=William |title=A New & Compendious History of the County of Warwick|year=1830 |page=367 }}</ref> and then to 3,684 in 1831.<ref name="Salzman" /> The census of 1881 revealed that the population had increased from 4,662 in 1861<ref>{{cite book|last=McCulloch |first=John Ramsay |title=A Dictionary, Geographical, Statistical, and Historical: Of the Various Countries, Places, and Principal Natural Objects in the World |year=1866 |publisher=Longmans |page=246 |author2=Martin, Frederick }}</ref> to 7,737.

The increasing population of Sutton Coldfield parish was recognised in the mid-19th century and new [[ecclesiastical parish]]es were created from it to better serve the residents of the communities that made up Sutton. The first ecclesiastical parish to be created was Walmley in 1846, with the recently completed St. John the Evangelist Church becoming the parish church.<ref name="Bracken88">{{cite book|last=Bracken |first=L. |title=History of the forest and chase of Sutton Coldfield |year=1860 |publisher=Benjamin Hall|page=88}}</ref> Hill became the next ecclesiastical parish in 1853, with its church being St. James' Church in Mere Green.<ref name="Bracken87">{{cite book|last=Bracken |first=L. |title=History of the forest and chase of Sutton Coldfield |year=1860 |publisher=Benjamin Hall|page=87}}</ref> Boldmere parish was created in 1857, with St. Michael's Church becoming its parish church.<ref name="Bracken89">{{cite book|last=Bracken |first=L. |title=History of the forest and chase of Sutton Coldfield |year=1860 |publisher=Benjamin Hall|page=89}}</ref> Holy Trinity Church was further extended with a north outer aisle and vestries in 1874-9.<ref name="Salzman" />

The construction of Shenstone Pumping Station in 1892 gave Sutton Coldfield its first tapped water supply.<ref>{{cite web|title=Potted History |url=http://southstaffswaterarchives.org.uk/Potted%20History.htm |publisher=South Staffordshire Water Archives |accessdate=6 November 2010}}</ref> In 1870, W.T.

==== ''Ashford v Thornton'' ====
{{main|Ashford v Thornton}}
Sutton Coldfield was the focus of national attention in 1817 when a young woman named Mary Ashford was found murdered in the town. She had been attending a party in Erdington on the evening of 26 May 1817,<ref>{{cite book|last=Hall|first=Sir John|year=1926|publisher=William Hodge & Co. Ltd.|title=Trial of Abraham Thornton |pages=1–2}}</ref> and had left with Abraham Thornton and her friend Hannah Cox, who left Mary and Abraham.<ref>{{cite book|last=Hall|first=Sir John|year=1926|publisher=William Hodge & Co.

Thornton was quickly traced and arrested for her murder.<ref>{{cite book|last=Hall|first=Sir John|year=1926|publisher=William Hodge & Co.

Public response to the acquittal was that of outrage and a private appeal was brought against the verdict by Mary's brother, William Ashford.<ref>{{cite book|last=Megarry|first=Sir Robert|year=2005|publisher=|title=A New Miscellany-at-Law: Yet Another Diversion for Lawyers and Others|isbn=1-58477-631-5|url=https://books.google.com/?id=exU2ejrCpNMC&lpg=PA68&dq=ashford%20v.%20thornton&pg=PA68#v=onepage&q=ashford%20v.%20thornton |page=69 |accessdate=2 August 2014}}</ref> Thornton was taken to London where he was tried at the King's Bench.<ref>{{cite book|last=Hall|first=Sir John|year=1926|publisher=William Hodge & Co.

Thornton threw down the other for William Ashford to pick up and thus accept the challenge, which Ashford did not do. By Ashford not accepting the challenge under the [[trial by combat]] laws, Thornton was freed, although by this time he gained a notorious reputation.<ref>{{cite book|last=Hall|first=Sir John|year=1926|publisher=William Hodge & Co. Ltd.|title=Trial of Abraham Thornton |pages=55–56}}</ref> In 1819, a bill was introduced and an Act passed to abolish private appeals after acquittals and also abolish trial by combat.

=== 20th century ===
In the 20th century, Sutton Coldfield continued to grow. The areas on the fringes of the district remained rural up until the end of [[World War I]]. As witnessed nationally, there was a house construction boom in areas such as [[Boldmere]], [[Walmley]], [[Erdington]] and [[Four Oaks, Birmingham|Four Oaks]]. Again, the population increased rapidly. During [[World War II]], Sutton Park and areas of Walmley were used as prisoner-of-war camps, housing German and Italian prisoners. After the war, Sutton witnessed a major redevelopment. The Borough Council commissioned [[Max Lock]] and Partners to draw up plans for the redevelopment of the town centre in 1960, with a preliminary report being delivered in May 1961 and a detailed report in 1962.<ref>{{cite web|last=Theis |first=Michael |title=A Print-out of the Preliminary Catalogue of the Max Lock Archive |url=http://www.westminster.ac.uk/__data/assets/pdf_file/0007/42388/MLC-archive-catalogue.pdf |publisher=University of Westminster |accessdate=3 November 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721015237/http://www.westminster.ac.uk/__data/assets/pdf_file/0007/42388/MLC-archive-catalogue.pdf |archivedate=21 July 2011 |df=dmy }}</ref> The Parade in the town centre was almost completely demolished for the construction of a large new shopping centre named Gracechurch. In addition, shopping centres in [[Wylde Green]] and [[Mere Green, Birmingham|Mere Green]] were constructed causing considerable objection as many local landmarks were lost to the developers.

==== Merging into Birmingham ====
In 1974, Sutton Coldfield became part of Birmingham when the [[West Midlands (county)|metropolitan county of the West Midlands]] was formed. More recently, Sutton Coldfield has undergone changes. Areas of the town centre have been pedestrianised and the Gracechurch Centre has been improved.

Plans for the proposed construction of five tower blocks for pensioners at Brassington Avenue in the town centre were abandoned in November 2015.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.suttoncoldfieldobserver.co.uk/collapse-brassington-avenue-retirement-home-plans/story-28184380-detail/story.html |title="Collapse of Brassington Avenue retirement home plans in Sutton Coldfield confirmed", Sutton Coldfield Observer, published 16 November 2016 |access-date=30 September 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151117152353/http://www.suttoncoldfieldobserver.co.uk/Collapse-Brassington-Avenue-retirement-home-plans/story-28184380-detail/story.html |archive-date=17 November 2015 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}</ref>

On 1 March 2015, a new Sutton Coldfield parish council was formally incorporated. This gave the town more powers from Birmingham City Council.

== Governance ==
[[File:BirminghamSuttonColdfield.png|thumb|right|Sutton Coldfield constituency shown within [[Birmingham]]]]
In 1528, a charter of [[Henry VIII of England|King Henry VIII]] gave the town the right to be known as "The Royal Town of Sutton Coldfield" and to be governed by a warden and society. The charter was secured by [[John Vesey|Bishop John Vesey]]. This [[Unreformed boroughs in England and Wales 1835 - 1886|unreformed corporation]] survived until 1885, when it was replaced by a [[municipal borough]]. Although the title "Royal Town" was still used, the municipality created in 1885 was not itself a [[Royal borough]]. However, the townspeople sometimes still use its historic 'Royal' title. This was confirmed to be allowed in 2014 after a two-year campaign by a local newspaper, the ''Sutton Coldfield Observer'', [[Andrew Mitchell]] MP, the Sutton Coldfield Civic Society and various local residents. On Thursday, 12 June 2014 government minister [[Greg Clark]] confirmed during a special adjournment debate in the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] that "there is no statutory ban to the continuance of historic titles for other [non-governance] purposes" in the absence of a local governing structure using a historic name, and thus the use of the Royal title is not prohibited (although any such usage has a "lack of technical legal effect").<ref name=Observer/><ref name=Reaffirmed/> Following that confirmation, the newspaper renamed itself the ''Royal Sutton Coldfield Observer''.

The town and borough were ceremonially part of [[Warwickshire]] until 1974, when it was amalgamated into the City of Birmingham and the [[metropolitan county]] of the [[West Midlands (county)|West Midlands]]. The formal [[Mayor]]al chains of office are now on display in [[Council House, Birmingham|Birmingham Council House]].

Sutton Coldfield forms the [[Sutton Coldfield (UK Parliament constituency)|Sutton Coldfield parliamentary constituency]], the largest Parliamentary Constituency in Birmingham whose [[Member of Parliament]] since 2001 has been [[Andrew Mitchell]] ([[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]]). Within the City of Birmingham metropolitan borough, it comprises the wards of [[Sutton Four Oaks]], [[Sutton Trinity]], [[Sutton Vesey]] and [[Sutton New Hall]]. The ward of [[Erdington]] ceased to be part of the constituency in 1974 due to the Local Government Act of 1972.  Sutton Trinity ward was created in June 2004, at which time the other three wards' boundaries were changed. From 5 April 2004, it has been a [[Government of Birmingham|council constituency]], with many local services managed by a [[district committee]] made up of all Sutton's councillors.

In 2015 the eligible electorate within the  Royal town's boundary were asked whether they wished to be governed by an independent Town council. The result of the election was that almost 70% were in favour of a Sutton Coldfield Town Council. Work is now ongoing in the [[Birmingham City Council]] to create a new council and decide which powers to transfer.<ref>https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-birmingham-33591076</ref> The first parish council election took place on 5 May 2016.<ref>http://www.birmingham.gov.uk/cs/Satellite?c=Page&childpagename=Elections%2FPageLayout&cid=1223518507412&pagename=BCC%2FCommon%2FWrapper%2FInlineWrapper</ref>

The northern stretch of the Birmingham city [[sandstone]] ridge culminates at Sutton Coldfield. [[Plants Brook]] rises in the area of Streetly and flows through Sutton Park and directly beneath the town centre, then Plants Brook briefly flows through [[Erdington]], notably [[Pype Hayes Park]] before returning to Sutton and culminating at [[Plantsbrook Local Nature Reserve|Plantsbrook Nature Reserve]] on the Erdington / [[Walmley]] border at Eachelhurst Road.

== Retail ==
The main shopping centre is the [https://web.archive.org/web/20070915095000/http://www.themall.co.uk/my-mall/sutton-coldfield/index.aspx Sutton Coldfield Mall], which was built in 1974 as 'The Gracechurch Shopping Centre'. It changed its name after being bought by [[The Mall Company]] and was, by the end of 2008 rebranded 'The Mall, Sutton Coldfield'.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://icsuttoncoldfield.icnetwork.co.uk/news/localnews/tm_headline=re-branding-the-mall%26method=full%26objectid=19989122%26siteid=52630-name_page.html |title= Re-branding The Mall|publisher=icSutton Coldfield|date=18 October 2007|accessdate=22 October 2007}}</ref> The Mall complex also includes a multi-storey car park. As a result of investment, the appearance of the shopping centre was improved in 2006 which included the installation of a glass roof above one of the walkways and the removal of a public square to form a cafe and extra retail units. There are now plans to construct a food court above Bishop's Court in the shopping centre.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://icsuttoncoldfield.icnetwork.co.uk/news/localnews/tm_headline=food-court-idea-for-gracechurch%26method=full%26objectid=19953945%26siteid=52630-name_page.html |title=Food court idea for Gracechurch|publisher=icSutton Coldfield|date=11 October 2007|accessdate=22 October 2007}}</ref> The shopping centre was formerly home to three bronze sculptures that depict, respectively, a boy and a girl on rollerskates, a boy with a dog, and a boy and a girl playing leapfrog, which have been moved to Rectory Park.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://icsuttoncoldfield.icnetwork.co.uk/news/localnews/tm_headline=statues-claimed%26method=full%26objectid=19989136%26siteid=52630-name_page.html |title=Statues claimed|publisher=icSutton Coldfield|date=18 October 2007|accessdate=22 October 2007}}</ref>

A second shopping centre was named the Sainsbury Centre until Sainsbury's closed their store;<ref>''Sainsbury's quits shopping centre'', Birmingham Evening Mail, 27 February 2001</ref> the name was later changed to "The Red Rose Centre". The centre has its own [[multi-storey car park]] with access from Victoria Road.

Sutton Parade is a continuation of Birmingham Road and Lichfield Road (though there is a bypass for traffic).  New Hall Walk is a row of shops built behind The Parade in the late 1990s. The company that manages the site also manages several of the shops on the Parade built at the same time. It has its own large outdoor car park. Opposite the Red Rose Centre, behind New Hall Walk, is a single floor, indoor market facility known as the In Shops.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}

There are several local shopping parades serving the suburbs of Sutton, including "The Lanes" Shopping Centre in Wylde Green, at Walmley, and at Boldmere Road.

== Sport ==
{{unreferenced section|date=November 2018}}
[[Rugby Union]] is  a popular sport in the area. Two clubs currently represent the area; [[Sutton Coldfield RFC]] founded and based on the Walmley Road in 1924, while [[Spartans RFC]] (founded 1960) is located at Coppice Lane. A friendly rivalry exists between the two amateur clubs with the former sporting a slight advantage in member numbers.

Football wise Sutton Coldfield is represented by [[Sutton Coldfield Town F.C.]], which was founded in 1879 and also to [[Paget Rangers F.C.]] who share their ground at Coles Lane. Golf is a major sport in the town, which is home to numerous golf clubs and courses. In the south of Sutton Coldfield is Walmley Golf Club and [[Pype Hayes]] Golf Course. There are also Aston Wood Golf Club, Moor Hall Golf Club, Sutton Coldfield Golf Club, Little Aston and Boldmere Golf Club. Nearby is [[The Belfry]], a hotel with a renowned golf complex whose Brabazon course has hosted the [[Ryder Cup]] several times.

Sports facilities, including [[swimming pool]] and [[400m]] [[athletics track]], are located at Wyndley Leisure Centre, on the edge of [[Sutton Park, West Midlands|Sutton Park]]. This was opened in 1971 by Ethel E. Dunnett. The nearby youth centre was opened in September 1968. Parts of Rectory Park is leased to Sutton Coldfield Hockey Club, Sutton Coldfield Cricket Club and Sutton Town Football Club.

The majority of this is in the north of the City, particularly to the north and east of Sutton Coldfield.<ref>http://www.suttoncoldfieldrural.com/</ref> The current Green Belt within Birmingham was initially installed in place in 1955 and was last reviewed around 20 years ago, since then the boundaries have remained unchanged.

== Public facilities ==
The [[Sutton Coldfield Town Hall|Town Hall]], a relic of Sutton Coldfield's former status as a municipal borough, now serves as a theatre, conference, and function venue.

In the town centre is Sutton Parade which is a pedestrianised shopping area.  [http://www.birmingham.gov.uk/suttoncoldfieldlibrary Sutton Coldfield Library], opened in 1974, is located near Sutton Parade above the Red Rose Centre. It also contains the Sutton Coldfield Reference Library, which holds a large collection of newspapers and magazines with all Sutton Coldfield based publications such as [[Sutton Coldfield News]] and Sutton Coldfield Observer being held permanently.<ref>[http://www.birmingham.gov.uk/GenerateContent?CONTENT_ITEM_ID=70061&CONTENT_ITEM_TYPE=0&MENU_ID=260 Birmingham City Council: Newspapers and Magazines held in Sutton Coldfield Reference Library] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080609065057/http://www.birmingham.gov.uk/GenerateContent?CONTENT_ITEM_ID=70061&CONTENT_ITEM_TYPE=0&MENU_ID=260 |date=9 June 2008 }}</ref> The Library closed in May 2010 due to the discovery of disturbed asbestos and reopened in May 2013.

Also in the Town centre is [[Sutton Coldfield railway station]] which is part of the Birmingham [[Cross-City Line]], nearby is the Town Gate entrance to [[Sutton Park, West Midlands|Sutton Park]] fairly close to the Sutton Park Visitor’s Centre.

Sutton Coldfield has four Community Centres and a number of smaller Community Halls all offering classes and events in a wide verity of subjects and interests - 
*Mere Green Community Centre
*Falcon Lodge Community Centre
*Banners Gate Community Hall
*Brampton Hall Community Centre

[[Good Hope Hospital]] provides main hospital services to the town, including [[Emergency department|accident and emergency]] facilities. Another hospital in Sutton Coldfield is Sutton Cottage Hospital, which is operated by the [[Birmingham East and North Primary Care Trust]].<ref>[http://www.nhs.uk/ServiceDirectories/Pages/Trust.aspx?id=5PG&v=1 NHS Birmingham East and North PCT: Hospitals] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071121112122/http://www.nhs.uk/ServiceDirectories/Pages/Trust.aspx?id=5PG&v=1 |date=21 November 2007 }}</ref> It opened in 1908 and the buildings were designed by [[Herbert Tudor Buckland]] and [[Edward Haywood-Farmer]].<ref>{{PastScape|mnumber=1060879 |mname= Sutton Coldfield Hospital |accessdate=2 August 2014}}</ref>

On Lichfield Road, Sutton Coldfield is served by a police station, [[Magistrates' Court (England and Wales)|magistrates court]] (both opened in 1960, the court now closed) and fire station (opened 1963). On the opposite side of the road is [[Sutton Coldfield College]], which is the main [[college]] of [[further education]] for the area. Also located on the north-eastern outskirts of the area is [[Sutton Coldfield transmitting station]], the first television transmitter to broadcast outside the London area.

== Transport ==
[[File:Sutton Town railway station.jpg|right|thumb|The former Sutton Town railway station on Midland Drive. The station opened in 1879 and closed in 1924, and is now converted to offices. The adjacent railway line is still in use by [[freight]] services only.]]
Linked by regular and fast services from [[Sutton Coldfield railway station]] on the [[Cross-City Line]] to the centre of Birmingham, Sutton is mostly a commuter dormitory town for people who work in Birmingham. The 1955 [[Sutton Coldfield rail crash]] occurred here, when an express train entered the very tight curve through the station much faster than the speed limit of {{convert|30|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}}. The [[Sutton Park Line]] also crosses the town roughly perpendicular to the cross-city line (crossing at a point out of easy sight near the former Midland Road station), but lost its passenger services and stations in the 1964 "[[Beeching Axe]]". It retained a loading bay at the adjacent Clifton Road Royal Mail sorting office for a time, but now remains as a freight only line.

The [[Roman road]] [[Icknield Street]] cuts through [[Sutton Park, West Midlands|Sutton Park]] to the west of the town. The town is bypassed to the north by the [[M6 Toll]], the first toll motorway in the UK, accessible from Sutton by junction T2 at Minworth (co-located with the [[M42 motorway|M42]] junction), T3 and T4 (interchanging with the [[A38 road|A38]] at the south and north ends of their {{convert|5|mi|km|adj=on}} parallel run), and T5 at Shenstone. It also has easy access to the [[M6 motorway|M6]] to the South, via junctions 5 (Castle Bromwich), J6 (Gravelly Hill, or [[Gravelly Hill Interchange|"Spaghetti Junction"]]) and J7 at Great Barr; and also the [[M42 motorway|M42]] in the east, via junction 9 near Minworth.

The [[A38 road|A38]] itself used to run through the centre of the town (literally, using the since-pedestrianised line of the Parade), but now uses the dual carriageway bypass to the east. The former route of the A38 is now the [[A5127]] Lichfield Road, branching from the southern end of the Aston Expressway on the Birmingham Middleway ring road, and continues to provide a major connective route running between and on slightly altered paths through the centres of Erdington, Sutton and Lichfield.

The Parade in the town centre is the main destination and terminus for numerous [[National Express West Midlands]] bus services in and through Sutton Coldfield. Such routes as 'Sutton Lines' (X3, X4, X5, X14) to Birmingham, 77 to Walsall and 5 to West Bromwich; to name just a few arterial routes.  The resultant congestion and perceived danger, from heavy (and almost exclusively) bus traffic on the repurposed and poorly sighted Lower Parade and Lower Queen Street coming into conflict with pedestrians (including children from several local schools) crossing between the Red Rose Centre and the other shopping areas, has led to calls for a dedicated bus centre to be built external to the town centre. [[West Midlands Passenger Transport Executive|Centro]] (now [[Transport for West Midlands]] have not yet come up with a solution. A solution to this problem does not look likely any time soon (June 2017).

== Education ==
[http://www.fairfax.bham.sch.uk/ Fairfax School] is on Reddicap Heath Road in the east of the town. Opposite the school is The [[John Willmott School]].  [[Sutton Coldfield Grammar School for Girls]] is on Jockey Road ([[A453 road|A453]]).

[[The Arthur Terry School]] is on Kittoe Road in [[Four Oaks, Birmingham|Four Oaks]] in the north of the town near [[Butlers Lane railway station|Butlers Lane station]]. The [[Plantsbrook School]] is on Upper Holland Road near the centre of the town in [[Maney]]. The [[Bishop Walsh Catholic School]] is next to the [[Sutton Park Line]] and [[New Hall Valley Country Park]]; the school is 10 minutes from [[Wylde Green]]. All these schools are for ages 11–18. However, from September 1972 until July 1992, schools in the Sutton Coldfield area were divided into first school for pupils aged 5–8 years, middle schools for pupils aged 8–12 years, while the entry age for secondary school was set at 12 years.

== Sutton Coldfield in literature ==

The town is mentioned in Shakespeare's [[Henry IV, Part 1]], Act 4, scene 2. Falstaff, "on a public road near Coventry", who is leading a band of conscripted men on the way to what will be the [[Battle of Shrewsbury]], tells Bardolph of his determination to march from Coventry to Sutton that evening:

:''Falstaff'':  Bardolph, get thee before to Coventry; fill me a bottle of sack: our soldiers shall march through: we’ll to Sutton-Co’fil’ to-night.

Sutton Coldfield is also included in Ferguson's Gang - The Maidens behind the Masks; the group of society women who made anonymous donations of sacks of money to the National Trust in order to save historically important properties in the 1930s.  A number of Gang members and supporters lived in and around Sutton Coldfield.<ref>{{cite book|last=Hutton-North|first=Anna|title=Ferguson's Gang - The Maidens behind the Masks|year=2013|publisher=Lulu Inc|isbn=978-1-291-48453-3}}</ref>
