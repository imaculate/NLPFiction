==History==
Philadelphia celebrated the 100th anniversary of the [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]] with the [[Centennial Exposition]] in 1876. [[Memorial Hall (Philadelphia)|Memorial Hall]], which contained the art gallery, was intended to outlast the Exposition and house a permanent museum. Following the example of London's [[Victoria and Albert Museum|South Kensington Museum]], the new museum was to focus on applied art and science, and provide a school to train craftsmen in drawing, painting, modeling, and designing.<ref name="history 1"/>

The [[Pennsylvania Museum and School of Industrial Art]] opened on May 10, 1877. (The school became independent of the museum in 1964 and is now part of the [[University of the Arts (Philadelphia)|University of the Arts]]). The museum's collection began with objects from the Exposition and gifts from the public impressed with the Exposition's ideals of good design and craftsmanship. European and Japanese fine and decorative art objects and books for the museum's library were among the first donations. The location outside of [[Center City Philadelphia|Center City]], however, was fairly distant from many of the city's inhabitants.<ref name="glasssteelandstone.com">{{cite web |url=http://www.glasssteelandstone.com/BuildingDetail/472.php |title=Philadelphia Museum of Art :: Benjamin Franklin Parkway, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States |publisher=Glass Steel and Stone |date= |accessdate=January 28, 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130511205337/http://www.glasssteelandstone.com/BuildingDetail/472.php |archivedate=May 11, 2013 |df= }}</ref> Admission was charged until 1881, then was dropped until 1962.<ref name="history 2"/>

Starting in 1882, [[Clara Jessup Moore]] donated a remarkable collection of antique furniture, enamels, carved ivory, jewelry, metalwork, glass, ceramics, books, textiles and paintings. The Countess de Brazza's lace collection was acquired in 1894 forming the nucleus of the lace collection. In 1893 Anna H. Wilstach bequeathed a large painting collection, including many American paintings, and an endowment of half a million dollars for additional purchases. Works by [[James Abbott McNeill Whistler]] and [[George Inness]] were purchased within a few years and [[Henry Ossawa Tanner]]'s ''The Annunciation'' was bought in 1899.<ref name="history 2"/>

[[File:Plan for the Fairmount Parkway by Jacques Greber 1917.jpg|thumb|left|Fairmount Parkway plan, 1917]]
In the early 1900s, the museum started an education program for the general public, as well as a membership program.<ref name=history1900s>[http://www.philamuseum.org/information/45-225-21.html "About Us: Our Story: 1900-1910"].

The museum enlarged its print collection in 1928 with about 5,000 [[Old Master]] prints and drawings from the gift of Charles M. Lea, including French, German, Italian, and Netherlandish engravings.<ref name=history1920s/> Major exhibitions of the 1930s included works by [[Thomas Eakins|Eakins]], [[Édouard Manet|Manet]], [[Pierre-Auguste Renoir|Renoir]], [[Paul Cézanne|Cézanne]], [[Vincent van Gogh|van Gogh]], and [[Edgar Degas|Degas]].<ref name=history1930s>[http://www.philamuseum.org/information/45-228-24.html "About Us: Our Story: 1930-1940"].

''philamuseum.org''. Philadelphia Museum of Art. Retrieved March 27, 2018.</ref>

Early modern art dominated the growth of the collections in the 1950s, with acquisitions of the Louise and [[Walter Conrad Arensberg|Walter Arensberg]] and the [[Albert Eugene Gallatin|A.E. Gallatin]] collections. The gift of Philadelphian [[Grace Kelly]]'s wedding dress is perhaps the best known gift of the 1950s.<ref name="history 0"/>

Extensive renovation of the building lasted from the 1960s through 1976. Major acquisitions included the Carroll S. Tyson, Jr. and Samuel S. White III and Vera White collections, 71 objects from designer [[Elsa Schiaparelli]], and [[Marcel Duchamp]]'s [[Étant donnés]]. In 1976 there were celebrations and special exhibitions for the centennial of the museum and the bicentennial of the nation. During the last three decades major acquisitions have included ''After the Bath'' by [[Edgar Degas]] and ''Fifty Days at Iliam'' by [[Cy Twombly]].<ref name="history 0">{{cite web|title=An Overview of the Museum's History |website=philamuseum.org |publisher=Philadelphia Museum of Art |url=http://www.philamuseum.org/information/45-19.html |accessdate=March 27, 2018}}</ref>

===Main building===
[[File:A357, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA, Museum of Art and Fairmount Water Works at night, 2009.JPG|thumb|left|Main building at night above [[Fairmount Water Works]]]]
The City Council of Philadelphia funded a competition in 1895 to design a new museum building,<ref name="history 2">{{cite web|url=http://www.philamuseum.org/information/45-224-20.html |title=The Early Decades: 1877–1900 |website=philamuseum.org |publisher=Philadelphia Museum of Art |accessdate=October 22, 2018}}</ref> but it was not until 1907 that plans were first made to construct it on Fairmount, a rocky hill topped by the [[Fairmount Reservoir|city's main reservoir]]. The Fairmount Parkway (renamed [[Benjamin Franklin Parkway]]), a grand boulevard that cut diagonally across the grid of city streets, was designed to terminate at the foot of the hill. But there were conflicting views about whether to erect a single museum building, or a number of buildings to house individual collections. The architectural firms of [[Horace Trumbauer]] and [[Zantzinger, Borie and Medary]] collaborated for more than a decade to resolve these issues. The final design is mostly credited to two architects in Trumbauer's firm: Howell Lewis Shay for the building's plan and [[massing]], and [[Julian Abele]] for the detail work and perspective drawings.<ref>David B. Brownlee, ''Making a Modern Classic: The Architecture of the Philadelphia Museum of Art'' (Philadelphia Museum of Art, 1997), pp. 60–61, 72–73.</ref> In 1902, Abele had become the first African-American student to be graduated from the [[University of Pennsylvania]]'s Department of Architecture, which is presently known as Penn's [[University of Pennsylvania School of Design|School of Design]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.philadelphiabuildings.org/pab/app/ar_display.cfm/21458 |title=Abele, Julian Francis (1881 - 1950) Architect |last=Tatman |first=Sandra L. |website=philadelphiabuildings.org |publisher=The [[Athenaeum of Philadelphia]] |accessdate=March 24, 2017}}</ref> Abele adapted classical Greek temple columns for the design of the museum entrances, and was responsible for the colors of both the building stone and the figures added to one of the [[pediment]]s.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.design.upenn.edu/people/julian-francis-abele-1881-1950 |title=Julian Francis Abele (1881-1950): First African American graduate of the School of Fine Arts |website=design.upenn.edu |publisher=[[University of Pennsylvania School of Design]] |accessdate=March 24, 2017}}</ref>

Construction of the main building began in 1919, when Mayor [[Thomas B. Smith]] laid the cornerstone in a Masonic ceremony. Because of shortages caused by World War I and other delays, the new building was not completed until 1928.<ref name="history 0"/> The building was constructed with [[dolomite]] quarried in Minnesota.<ref name="withartphila">{{cite web |url=http://withart.visitphilly.com/tours/galleries-and-gardens/ |title=Galleries and Gardens: Discover blossoming works of art in Philadelphia's green spaces |publisher=With Art Philadelphia |accessdate=March 28, 2016}}</ref>

The wings were intentionally built first, to help assure the continued funding for the completion of the design. Once the building's exterior was completed, twenty second-floor galleries containing English and American art opened to the public on March 26, 1928 though a large amount of interior work was incomplete.<ref name=history1920s/>

==Gallery expansion==
[[File:Philadelphia Museum of Art Construction rear.JPG|thumb|left|upright=0.7|The west entrance covered during construction in 2008]]
Due to high attendance and overflowing collections, the museum announced in October 2006 that [[Frank Gehry]] would design a building expansion. The {{convert|80000|ft2|adj=on}} gallery will be built entirely underground behind the east entrance stairs and will not alter any of the museum's existing Greek revival facade. The construction is projected to last a decade and cost $500 million. It will increase the museum's available display space by sixty percent and house mostly contemporary sculpture, Asian art, and special exhibitions.<ref name="nytimes">{{cite news | first=Robin | last=Pogrebin | authorlink=Robin Pogrebin | url=http://travel.nytimes.com/2006/10/19/arts/design/19gehr.html | title=Philadelphia Museum Job Sends Gehry Underground| publisher=New York Times | date=October 19, 2006 }}</ref><ref name = "Master Plan">[http://www.philamuseum.org/information/294-508-397.html PMA web site] "Master Plan", accessed, May 10, 2012</ref>

Uncertainty was cast on the plans by the 2008 death of [[Anne d'Harnoncourt]], but new director [[Timothy Rub]], who had initiated a $350 million expansion at the [[Cleveland Museum of Art]], will be carrying out the plans as scheduled.  In 2010, Gehry attended the groundbreaking for the second phase of the expansion, due to be completed in 2012.  In that phase, a new art handling facility was created on the south side of the building, enabling the museum to reclaim a street level entrance, closed since the mid-1970s, which leads to a 640-foot-long vaulted walkway that extends across the museum and is original to the 1928 building.<ref>[http://planphilly.com/eyesonthestreet/2014/07/02/frank-gehry-s-quiet-intervention-at-the-philadelphia-museum-of-art "Frank Gehry's Quiet Intervention at the Philadelphia Museum of Art"], Plan Philly, Accessed May 14, 2017.</ref> The north entrance will be reopened to the public as a part of the "core project", which is scheduled for completion in 2020.<ref> Romero, Melissa.

==In popular culture==

Besides being known for its architecture and collections, the Philadelphia Museum of Art has in recent decades become known due to the role it played in the ''[[Rocky]]'' films{{emdash}}''Rocky'' (1976) and five of its six sequels, ''[[Rocky II|II]]'', ''[[Rocky III|III]]'', ''[[Rocky V|V]]'', ''[[Rocky Balboa (film)|Rocky Balboa]]'' and ''[[Creed (film)|Creed]]''. Visitors to the museum are often seen mimicking [[Rocky Balboa]]'s (portrayed by [[Sylvester Stallone]]) famous run up the east entrance stairs, informally nicknamed the [[Rocky Steps]].<ref>[http://www.visitphilly.com/museums-attractions/philadelphia/the-rocky-statue-and-the-rocky-steps/ The Rocky Statue and the Rocky Steps] visitphilly.com, accessed June 17, 2011.</ref> [[Screen Junkies]] named the museum's stairs the second most famous movie location behind only [[Grand Central Terminal|Grand Central Station]] in New York.<ref>[http://www.screenjunkies.com/movies/movie-lists/10-most-famous-movie-locations/ ''10 Most Famous Movie Locations''] [[Screen Junkies]]</ref>

An {{convert|8.5|ft|m|abbr=on}} tall bronze statue of the Rocky Balboa character was created in 1980 and placed at the top of the stairs in 1982 for the filming of ''[[Rocky III]]''. After filming was complete, Stallone donated the statue to the city of Philadelphia. The Philadelphia Art Commission eventually decided to relocate the statue to the now-defunct [[Wachovia Spectrum#Statues|Spectrum]] sports arena due to controversy over its prominent placement at the top of the museum's front stairs and questions about its artistic merit. The statue was placed briefly on top of the stairs again for the film ''Rocky V'' and then returned to the Spectrum. In 2006, the statue was relocated to a new display area on the north side of the base of the stairs.<ref name=rocky1>{{cite web |last=Avery |first=Ron |url=http://www.ushistory.org/oddities/rocky.htm |title=Philadelphia Oddities - Rocky Statue |publisher=Independence Hall Association |date= |accessdate=March 28, 2016}}</ref><ref name=rocky2>{{cite web |last=Holzman |first=Laura |url=http://philadelphiaencyclopedia.org/archive/rocky/ |title=Rocky |publisher=Encyclopedia of Greater Philadelphia |date=2013 |accessdate=March 28, 2016}}</ref>

[[File:Philaartmusliv8.jpg|thumb|[[Live 8]] on the Ben Franklin Parkway with the museum in the distance, July 2, 2005]]
The museum provides the backdrop for concerts and parades because of its location at the end of the Ben Franklin Parkway.
