'''New Jersey''' is a [[U.S. state|state]] in the [[Mid-Atlantic States|Mid-Atlantic]] region of the [[Northeastern United States]]. It is a [[peninsula]], bordered on the north and east by the state of [[New York (state)|New York]], particularly along the extent of the length of New York City on its western edge; on the east, southeast, and south by the Atlantic Ocean; on the west by the [[Delaware River]] and [[Pennsylvania]]; and on the southwest by the [[Delaware Bay]] and [[Delaware]].

New Jersey was inhabited by Native Americans for more than 2,800 years, with historical tribes such as the [[Lenape]] along the coast. In the early 17th century, the Dutch and the [[Sweden|Swedes]] made the first European settlements in the state.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.usgennet.org/usa/nj/state/NJ-History.htm|title=NJ History Outline|publisher=Usgennet.org|accessdate=July 25, 2010}}</ref> The [[Kingdom of England|English]] later seized control of the region,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.infoplease.com/ce6/us/A0859954.html|title=Encyclopedia – New Jersey History|publisher=2000–2011 Pearson Education, publishing as Infoplease|accessdate=September 18, 2011}}</ref> naming it the [[Province of New Jersey]] after the largest of the [[Channel Islands]], [[Jersey]],<ref>{{cite encyclopedia|url=http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761559873/New_Jersey.html |title=MSN Encarta |publisher=Webcitation.org |accessdate=July 25, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5kwsuNvS8?url=http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761559873/New_Jersey.html |archivedate=November 1, 2009  }}</ref> and granting it as a colony to [[Sir George Carteret]] and [[John Berkeley, 1st Baron Berkeley of Stratton]]. New Jersey was the site of several decisive battles during the [[American Revolutionary War]] in the 18th century.

In the 19th century, factories in cities (known as the "Big Six"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1999/09/26/nyregion/new-jersey-s-cities-sad-urban-presence-encircled-by-wealth.html|title=New Jersey's Cities: Sad Urban Presence Encircled by Wealth|first=Laura|last=Mansnerus|date=September 26, 1999|access-date=December 21, 2017|work=The New York Times}}</ref>), [[Camden, New Jersey|Camden]], [[Paterson, New Jersey|Paterson]], [[Newark, New Jersey|Newark]], [[Trenton, New Jersey|Trenton]], [[Jersey City, New Jersey|Jersey City]], and [[Elizabeth, New Jersey|Elizabeth]] helped to drive the [[Industrial Revolution]]. New Jersey's geographic location at the center of the [[Northeast megalopolis]], between [[Boston]] and New York City to the northeast, and [[Philadelphia]], [[Baltimore]], and Washington, D.C., to the southwest, fueled its rapid growth through the process of suburbanization in the second half of the 20th century. In the first decades of the 21st century, this suburbanization began reverting with the consolidation of New Jersey's [[ethnic enclave|culturally diverse]] populace toward more urban settings within the state,<ref name=ReUrbanizationNJ2>{{cite web|url=http://www.northjersey.com/news/bergen-county-leads-population-growth-trend-halts-flow-to-other-parts-of-n-j-1.1532063|title=Bergen County leads population growth trend, halts flow to other parts of N.J|author=Dave Sheingold|date=March 24, 2016|accessdate=March 24, 2016|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160324145941/http://www.northjersey.com/news/bergen-county-leads-population-growth-trend-halts-flow-to-other-parts-of-n-j-1.1532063|archivedate=March 24, 2016}}</ref><ref name=ReUrbanizationNJ>{{cite web|url=http://www.northjersey.com/news/business/big-office-buildings-look-to-reinvent-themselves-1.1440856|title=What's the future for suburban office space?|author=Kathleen Lynn|date=October 25, 2015|accessdate=October 25, 2015}}</ref> with towns home to [[Commuter rail in North America|commuter rail stations]] outpacing the population growth of more [[automobile]]-oriented suburbs since 2008.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.northjersey.com/news/population-rebounds-around-train-stations-in-n-j-1.1546298|title=Population rebounds around train stations in N.J|author=Chrispher Maag|date=April 15, 2016|accessdate=April 15, 2016}}</ref>

==History==
{{Main|History of New Jersey}}

Around 180 million years ago, during the [[Jurassic]] Period, New Jersey bordered North Africa. The pressure of the collision between North America and Africa gave rise to the [[Appalachian Mountains]]. Around 18,000 years ago, the [[Wisconsin glaciation|Ice Age]] resulted in [[glacier]]s that reached New Jersey. As the glaciers retreated, they left behind [[Lake Passaic]], as well as many rivers, swamps, and gorges.<ref>[https://www.greatswamp.org/history-great-swamp/] by Great Swamp Watershed Association. Retrieved July 2, 2017.</ref>

New Jersey was originally settled by Native Americans, with the [[Lenape|Lenni-Lenape]] being dominant at the time of contact. ''Scheyichbi'' is the [[Lenape language|Lenape]] name for the land that is now New Jersey.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.getnj.com/storiesofnewjersey/sojpg9a.shtml |title=The Story of the Discovery of Scheyichbi |website=Stories of New Jersey |publisher=GET NJ |accessdate=February 8, 2013}}</ref> The Lenape were several [[Autonomy|autonomous]] groups that practiced maize agriculture in order to supplement their hunting and gathering in the region surrounding the [[Delaware River]], the lower [[Hudson River]], and western [[Long Island Sound]]. The Lenape society was divided into [[Matrilineality|matrilinear]] clans that were based upon common female ancestors. These clans were organized into three distinct [[phratry|phratries]] identified by their animal sign: Turtle, [[Turkey (bird)|Turkey]], and [[Wolf]]. They first encountered the [[Dutch colonization of the Americas|Dutch]] in the early 17th century, and their primary relationship with the Europeans was through [[fur trade]].

===Colonial era===
{{Main|Colonial history of New Jersey|New Netherland|New Sweden|Province of New Jersey|Dominion of New England}}
[[File:Nieuw Nederland and Nya Sverige.svg|thumb|right|upright|The relative location of the New Netherland and New Sweden settlements in eastern North America]]
The Dutch became the first Europeans to lay claim to lands in New Jersey. The Dutch colony of [[New Netherland]] consisted of parts of modern [[Middle Atlantic]] states. Although the European principle of [[land ownership]] was not recognized by the [[Lenape]], [[Dutch West India Company]] policy required its colonists to purchase the land that they settled. The first to do so was [[Michael Reyniersz Pauw|Michiel Pauw]] who established a patronship called [[Pavonia, New Netherland|Pavonia]] in 1630 along the [[North River (Hudson River)|North River]] which eventually became the [[Bergen, New Netherland|Bergen]]. [[Peter Minuit]]'s purchase of lands along the [[Delaware River]] established the colony of [[New Sweden]]. The entire region became a territory of [[Kingdom of England|England]] on June 24, 1664, after an English fleet under the command of Colonel [[Richard Nicolls]] sailed into what is today [[New York Harbor]] and took control of [[Fort Amsterdam]], annexing the entire province.

During the [[English Civil War]], the [[Channel Islands|Channel Island]] of [[Jersey]] remained loyal to the British Crown and gave sanctuary to the [[King of England|King]]. It was from the Royal Square in [[Saint Helier]] that [[Charles II of England]] was proclaimed King in 1649, following the execution of his father, [[Charles I of England|Charles I]]. The North American lands were divided by [[Charles II of England|Charles II]], who gave his brother, the Duke of York (later [[James II of England|King James II]]), the region between [[New England]] and [[Maryland]] as a [[proprietary colony]] (as opposed to a [[royal colony]]). James then granted the land between the [[Hudson River]] and the [[Delaware River]] (the land that would become New Jersey) to two friends who had remained loyal through the [[English Civil War]]: [[George Carteret|Sir George Carteret]] and [[John Berkeley, 1st Baron Berkeley of Stratton|Lord Berkeley of Stratton]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mrnussbaum.com/readingcomp/njcolony.htm|title=New Jersey Colony Reading Comprehension|publisher=MrNussbaum.com|accessdate=September 10, 2012}}</ref> The area was named the [[Province of New Jersey]].

Since the state's inception, New Jersey has been characterized by [[multiculturalism|ethnic and religious diversity]]. New England [[Congregationalists]] settled alongside [[Scots' Church, Melbourne|Scots Presbyterians]] and [[Dutch Reformed]] migrants. While the majority of residents lived in towns with individual landholdings of {{convert|100|acre|ha|0}}, a few rich proprietors owned vast estates. English [[Quakers]] and [[Anglicans]] owned large landholdings. Unlike [[Plymouth Colony]], [[Jamestown, Virginia|Jamestown]] and other colonies, New Jersey was populated by a secondary wave of immigrants who came from other colonies instead of those who migrated directly from Europe. New Jersey remained agrarian and rural throughout the colonial era, and [[commercial agriculture|commercial farming]] developed sporadically. Some townships, such as [[Burlington, New Jersey|Burlington]] on the Delaware River and [[Perth Amboy]], emerged as important ports for shipping to New York City and Philadelphia. The colony's fertile lands and tolerant religious policy drew more settlers, and New Jersey's population had increased to 120,000 by 1775.

Settlement for the first 10 years of English rule took place along [[Hackensack River]] and [[Arthur Kill]] – settlers came primarily from New York and New England. On March 18, 1673, Berkeley sold his half of the colony to [[Religious Society of Friends|Quakers]] in England, who settled the Delaware Valley region as a Quaker colony. ([[William Penn]] acted as trustee for the lands for a time.) New Jersey was governed very briefly as two distinct provinces, [[East Jersey|East]] and [[West Jersey]], for 28 years between 1674 and 1702, at times part of the [[Province of New York]] or [[Dominion of New England]].

In 1702, the two provinces were reunited under a [[Royal Governor of New Jersey|royal governor]], rather than a [[Proprietary governor|proprietary one]]. [[Edward Hyde, 3rd Earl of Clarendon|Edward Hyde]], Lord Cornbury, became the first governor of the colony as a royal colony. Britain believed that he was an ineffective and corrupt ruler, taking bribes and speculating on land. In 1708 he was recalled to England. New Jersey was then ruled by the governors of New York, but this infuriated the settlers of New Jersey, who accused those governors of favoritism to New York. [[Lewis Morris (governor)|Judge Lewis Morris]] led the case for a separate governor, and was appointed governor by [[George II of Great Britain|King George II]] in 1738.<ref>Streissguth pp. 30–36</ref>

===Revolutionary War era===

New Jersey was one of the [[Thirteen Colonies]] that revolted against British rule in the [[American Revolution]]. The [[s:New Jersey Constitution of 1776|New Jersey Constitution of 1776]] was passed July 2, 1776, just two days before the [[Second Continental Congress]] declared American Independence from [[Kingdom of Great Britain|Great Britain]]. It was an act of the [[Provincial Congress of New Jersey|Provincial Congress]], which made itself into the [[New Jersey Legislature|State Legislature]]. To reassure neutrals, it provided that it would become void if New Jersey reached reconciliation with Great Britain.

New Jersey representatives [[Richard Stockton (Continental Congressman)|Richard Stockton]], [[John Witherspoon]], [[Francis Hopkinson]], [[John Hart (New Jersey politician)|John Hart]], and [[Abraham Clark]] were among those who signed the [[United States Declaration of Independence]].
[[File:Washington Crossing the Delaware by Emanuel Leutze, MMA-NYC, 1851.jpg|thumb|''[[Washington Crossing the Delaware (1851 painting)|Washington Crossing the Delaware]]'' during the [[New York and New Jersey campaign]], winter 1777]]
During the [[American Revolutionary War]], British and American armies crossed New Jersey numerous times, and several pivotal battles took place in the state. Because of this, New Jersey today is often referred to as "The Crossroads of the American Revolution."<ref>{{cite web|title=About Crossroads of the American Revolution|url=http://revolutionarynj.org/about-crossroads-of-the-american-revolution/|publisher=Crossroads of the American Revolution}}</ref> The winter quarters of the [[Continental Army]] were established there twice by General [[George Washington]] in [[Morristown, New Jersey|Morristown]], which has been called "The Military Capital of the American Revolution".<ref>{{cite web|title=The Military Capital of the American Revolution|url=http://www.visitnj.org/article/military-capital-american-revolution|publisher=New Jersey Tourism}}</ref>

[[File:Princetonwashington.jpg|thumb|[[George Washington]] rallying his troops at the [[Battle of Princeton]]]]
On the night of December&nbsp;25–26, 1776, the Continental Army under [[Washington's crossing of the Delaware River|George Washington crossed the Delaware River]]. After the crossing, he surprised and defeated the [[Hessian (soldiers)|Hessian troops]] in the [[Battle of Trenton]]. Slightly more than a week after victory at [[Trenton, New Jersey|Trenton]], American forces gained an important victory by stopping [[Charles Cornwallis, 1st Marquess Cornwallis|General Cornwallis's]] charges at the [[Second Battle of Trenton]]. By evading Cornwallis's army, Washington made a surprise attack on [[Princeton, New Jersey|Princeton]] and successfully defeated the British forces there on January 3, 1777. [[Emanuel Leutze]]'s painting of ''[[Washington Crossing the Delaware (1851 painting)|Washington Crossing the Delaware]]'' became an icon of the Revolution.

American forces under Washington met the forces under General [[Henry Clinton (American War of Independence)|Henry Clinton]] at the [[Battle of Monmouth]] in an indecisive engagement in June 1778. Washington attempted to take the British column by surprise; when the British army attempted to flank the Americans, the Americans retreated in disorder. The ranks were later reorganized and withstood the British charges.

In the summer of 1783, the [[Continental Congress]] met in [[Nassau Hall]] at [[Princeton University]], making Princeton the nation's capital for four months. It was there that the Continental Congress learned of the signing of the [[Treaty of Paris (1783)]], which ended the war.

On December 18, 1787, New Jersey became the third state to ratify the [[United States Constitution]], which was overwhelmingly popular in New Jersey, as it prevented New York and Pennsylvania from charging [[tariff]]s on goods imported from Europe. On November 20, 1789, the state became the first in the newly formed Union to ratify the [[United States Bill of Rights|Bill of Rights]].

The 1776 [[New Jersey State Constitution]] gave the vote to "all inhabitants" who had a certain level of wealth. This included women and blacks, but not married women, because they could not own property separately from their husbands. Both sides, in several elections, claimed that the other side had had unqualified women vote and mocked them for use of "petticoat electors", whether entitled to vote or not; on the other hand, both parties passed Voting Rights Acts. In 1807, the legislature passed a bill interpreting the constitution to mean universal ''white male'' [[suffrage]], excluding paupers; the constitution was itself an act of the legislature and not enshrined as the modern constitution.<ref>Klinghoffer and Elkis ("The Petticoat Electors: Women's Suffrage in New Jersey, 1776–1807", ''Journal of the Early Republic'' 12, no. 2 (1992): 159–193.)</ref>

===19th century===
{{Main|New Jersey in the 19th century}}
On February 15, 1804, New Jersey became the last northern state to [[Abolitionism in the United States|abolish]] new [[slavery]] and enacted legislation that slowly phased out existing slavery. This led to a gradual decrease of the slave population. By the close of the [[American Civil War|Civil War]], about a dozen African Americans in New Jersey were still held in bondage.<ref>James Gigantino, The Ragged Road to Abolition: Slavery and Freedom in New Jersey, 1775–1865</ref> New Jersey voters initially refused to ratify the constitutional amendments banning slavery and granting rights to the United States' black population.
[[File:1827 Morris Canal.jpg|thumb|right|A map of the 107-mile long [[Morris Canal]] across northern New Jersey]]
Industrialization accelerated in the northern part of the state following completion of the [[Morris Canal]] in 1831. The canal allowed for coal to be brought from eastern [[Pennsylvania]]'s [[Lehigh Valley]] to northern New Jersey's growing industries in [[Paterson, New Jersey|Paterson]], [[Newark, New Jersey|Newark]], and [[Jersey City, New Jersey|Jersey City]].

In 1844, the second [[New Jersey State Constitution|state constitution]] was ratified and brought into effect. Counties thereby became districts for the State Senate, and some realignment of boundaries (including the creation of [[Mercer County, New Jersey|Mercer County]]) immediately followed. This provision was retained in the 1947 Constitution, but was overturned by the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] in 1962 by the decision ''[[Baker v. Carr]]''. While the Governorship was stronger than under the 1776 constitution, the constitution of 1844 created many offices that were not responsible to him, or to the people, and it gave him a three-year term, but he could not succeed himself.

New Jersey was one of the few Union states (the others being [[Delaware]] and [[Kentucky]]) to select a candidate other than [[Abraham Lincoln]] twice in national elections, and sided with [[Stephen Douglas]] (1860) and [[George B. McClellan]] (1864) during their campaigns. McClellan, a native Philadelphian, had New Jersey ties and formally resided in New Jersey at the time; he later became Governor of New Jersey (1878–81). (In New Jersey, the factions of the Democratic party managed an effective coalition in 1860.) During the [[American Civil War]], the state was led first by Republican Governor [[Charles Smith Olden]], then by Democrat [[Joel Parker (politician)|Joel Parker]]. During the course of the war, over 80,000 from the state enlisted in the Northern army; unlike many states, including some Northern ones, no battle was fought there. {{citation needed|date=September 2014}}

[[File:Newark NJ 1874.jpg|thumb|left|View of state's largest city, Newark, in 1874]]
In the [[Industrial Revolution]], cities like [[Paterson, New Jersey|Paterson]] grew and prospered. Previously, the economy had been largely agrarian, which was problematically subject to crop failures and poor soil. This caused a shift to a more industrialized economy, one based on manufactured commodities such as textiles and silk. [[List of inventors|Inventor]] [[Thomas Edison]] also became an important figure of the Industrial Revolution, having been [[List of Edison patents|granted 1,093 patents]], many of which for inventions he developed while working in New Jersey. Edison's facilities, first at [[Menlo Park, New Jersey|Menlo Park]] and then in [[West Orange, New Jersey|West Orange]], are considered perhaps the first [[research center]]s in the United States. Christie Street in Menlo Park was the first thoroughfare in the world to have electric lighting. Transportation was greatly improved as [[locomotive|locomotion]] and [[steamboat]]s were introduced to New Jersey.

[[Iron ore|Iron]] mining was also a leading industry during the middle to late 19th century. [[Bog iron]] pits in the southern New Jersey Pinelands were among the first sources of iron for the new nation.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.usgennet.org/usa/nj/county/atlantic/Pinelands/BogIron.htm|title=Usgennet.org|publisher=Usgennet.org|accessdate=July 25, 2010}}</ref> Mines such as Mt. Hope, Mine Hill and the Rockaway Valley Mines created a thriving industry. Mining generated the impetus for new towns and was one of the driving forces behind the need for the [[Morris Canal]]. [[Zinc]] mines were also a major industry, especially the [[Sterling Hill Mine]].

New Jersey prospered through the [[Roaring Twenties]]. The first [[Miss America Pageant]] was held in 1921 in [[Atlantic City]], the [[Holland Tunnel]] connecting [[Jersey City, New Jersey|Jersey City]] to [[Manhattan]] opened in 1927, and the first [[drive-in movie]] was shown in 1933 in Camden. During the [[Great Depression]] of the 1930s, the state offered begging licenses to unemployed residents,<ref>Gerdes, Louise I. ''The 1930s'', Greenhaven Press, Inc., 2000.</ref> the zeppelin airship [[Hindenburg disaster|Hindenburg]] crashed in flames over [[Lakehurst, New Jersey|Lakehurst]], and the [[SS Morro Castle (1930)|SS ''Morro Castle'']] beached itself near Asbury Park after going up in flames while at sea.

Through both [[World War]]s, New Jersey was a center for war production, especially in naval construction, notably at [[Federal Shipbuilding and Drydock Company]]. Battleships, cruisers, and destroyers were made in the state. New Jersey manufactured 6.8 percent of total United States military armaments produced during [[World War II]], ranking fifth among the 48 states.<ref>[[Whiz Kids (Department of Defense)|Peck, Merton J.]] & [[Frederic M.

New Jersey also became a principal location for defense in the [[Cold War]]. Fourteen [[Project Nike|Nike Missile]] stations were constructed, especially for the defense of New York City and [[Philadelphia]]. ''[[Motor Torpedo Boat PT-109|PT-109]]'', a motor torpedo boat commanded by Lt. (j.g.) [[John F. Kennedy]] in World War II, was built at the Elco Boatworks in Bayonne. The aircraft carrier [[USS Enterprise (CV-6)|USS ''Enterprise'' (CV-6)]] was briefly docked at the Military Ocean Terminal in Bayonne in the 1950s before she was sent to Kearney to be scrapped.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cv6.org/1946/scrap/default.htm|title=CV6.org|publisher=CV6.org|accessdate=July 25, 2010}}</ref> In 1962, the world's first nuclear-powered cargo ship, the [[NS Savannah]], was launched at Camden.

In 1951, the [[New Jersey Turnpike]] opened, permitting fast travel by car and truck between North Jersey (and [[New York metropolitan area|metropolitan New York]]) and South Jersey (and [[Delaware Valley|metropolitan Philadelphia]]).

In the 1960s, [[race riot]]s erupted in many of the industrial cities of North Jersey. The first race riots in New Jersey occurred in Jersey City on August 2, 1964. Several others ensued in 1967, in [[1967 Newark riots|Newark]] and [[1967 Plainfield riots|Plainfield]]. Other riots followed the assassination of [[Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.]] in April 1968, just as in the rest of the country. A riot occurred in [[Camden, New Jersey|Camden]] in 1971.

As a result of an order from the [[New Jersey Supreme Court]] to fund schools equitably, the New Jersey legislature passed an income tax bill in 1976. Prior to this bill, the state had no income tax.<ref name=tws29decf3354>{{cite web | title=Mission & History | publisher=Education Law Center | date=December 29, 2009 | url=http://www.edlawcenter.org/about/mission-history.html | accessdate=January 4, 2014 | at=History, ¶3}}</ref>

In the early part of the 2000s, two [[light rail]] systems were opened: the [[Hudson–Bergen Light Rail]] in Hudson County and the [[River Line (New Jersey Transit)|River Line]] between Camden and Trenton. The intent of these projects were to encourage [[transit-oriented development]] in North Jersey and South Jersey, respectively. The HBLR in particular was credited with a revitalization of Hudson County and [[Jersey City, New Jersey|Jersey City]] in particular.<ref>{{cite web|title=Livability: A Legacy of Northern N.J.

{{Main|Geography of New Jersey}}
{{See also|List of counties in New Jersey|Metropolitan Statistical Areas of New Jersey}}
New Jersey is bordered on the north and northeast by [[New York (state)|New York]] (parts of which are across the [[Hudson River]], [[Upper New York Bay]], the [[Kill Van Kull]], [[Newark Bay]], and the [[Arthur Kill]]); on the east by the Atlantic Ocean; on the southwest by [[Delaware]] across [[Delaware Bay]]; and on the west by [[Pennsylvania]] across the [[Delaware River]].

New Jersey is often broadly divided into three geographic regions: [[North Jersey]], [[Central Jersey]], and [[South Jersey]]. Some New Jersey residents do not consider Central Jersey a region in its own right, but others believe it is a separate geographic and cultural area from the North and South.

Within those regions are five distinct areas, based upon natural geography and population concentration. Northeastern New Jersey lies closest to [[Manhattan]] in New York City, and up to 1 million residents commute daily into the city for work, often via public transportation.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://wagner.nyu.edu/files/rudincenter/dynamic_pop_manhattan.pdf|title=The Dynamic Population of Manhattan|author1=Mitchell L. Moss  |author2=Carson Qing |lastauthoramp=yes |publisher=Rudin Center for Transportation Policy and Management, Wagner School of Public Service, New York University|date=March 2012|accessdate=April 16, 2016}}</ref> Northwestern New Jersey, is more wooded, rural, and mountainous. The [[Jersey shore]], along the Atlantic Coast in Central and South Jersey, has its own unique natural, residential, and cultural characteristics owing to its location by the ocean. The [[Delaware Valley]] includes the southwestern counties of the state, which reside within the [[Philadelphia Metropolitan Area]]. The [[Pine Barrens (New Jersey)|Pine Barrens]] region is in the southern interior of New Jersey. Covered rather extensively by mixed [[pine]] and [[oak]] forest, it has a much lower population density than much of the rest of the state.

The federal [[Office of Management and Budget]] divides New Jersey's counties into seven [[Metropolitan Statistical Area]]s, with 16 counties included in either the New York City or Philadelphia metro areas. Four counties have independent metro areas, and Warren County is part of the Pennsylvania-based [[Lehigh Valley]] metro area. New Jersey is also at the center of the [[Northeast megalopolis]].

[[High Point (New Jersey)|High Point]], in [[Montague Township, New Jersey|Montague Township]], [[Sussex County, New Jersey|Sussex County]], is the state's highest elevation, at {{convert|1803|ft|m}} above sea level. The state's highest [[prominence (mountains)|prominence]] is [[Kitty Ann Mountain]] in [[Morris County, New Jersey|Morris County]], rising 892 feet. The [[The Palisades (Hudson River)|Palisades]] are a line of steep cliffs on the west side of the [[Hudson River]], in [[Bergen County, New Jersey|Bergen]] and [[Hudson County, New Jersey|Hudson Counties]]. Major [[List of New Jersey rivers|New Jersey rivers]] include the [[Hudson River|Hudson]], [[Delaware River|Delaware]], [[Raritan River|Raritan]], [[Passaic River|Passaic]], [[Hackensack River|Hackensack]], [[Rahway River|Rahway]], [[Musconetcong River|Musconetcong]], [[Mullica River|Mullica]], [[Rancocas River|Rancocas]], [[Manasquan River|Manasquan]], [[Maurice River|Maurice]], and [[Toms River|Toms]] rivers. Due to New Jersey's [[peninsula]]r geography, both sunrise and sunset are visible over water from different points on the Jersey Shore.

===Climate===
There are two climatic conditions in the state. The south, central, and northeast parts of the state have a [[humid subtropical]] climate, while the northwest has a [[humid continental climate]] ([[microthermal]]), with much cooler temperatures due to higher elevation. New Jersey receives between 2,400 and 2,800 hours of [[sunshine]] annually.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://maps.howstuffworks.com/united-states-annual-sunshine-map.htm |title=united states annual sunshine map |publisher=HowStuffWorks, Inc |accessdate=March 14, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110429042722/http://maps.howstuffworks.com/united-states-annual-sunshine-map.htm |archivedate=April 29, 2011  }}</ref>

Summers are typically hot and humid, with statewide average high temperatures of {{convert|82|-|87|F}} and lows of {{convert|60|-|69|F}}; however, temperatures exceed {{convert|90|°F|0}} on average 25 days each summer, exceeding {{convert|100|°F|0}} in some years. Winters are usually cold, with average high temperatures of {{convert|34|-|43|F|C}} and lows of {{convert|16|to|28|F}} for most of the state, but temperatures can, for brief periods, fall below {{convert|10|°F|0}} and sometimes rise above {{convert|50|°F}}. Northwestern parts of the state have significantly colder winters with sub-{{convert|0|°F|0}} being an almost annual occurrence. Spring and autumn may feature wide temperature variations, with lower humidity than summer. The [[Hardiness zone|USDA Plant Hardiness Zone]] classification ranges from 6 in the northwest of the state, to 7B near Cape May.<ref>[http://www.arborday.org/treeinfo/zonelookup.cfm Hardiness Zone Lookup at]. Arborday.org. Retrieved July 12, 2013.</ref> All-time temperature extremes recorded in New Jersey include {{Convert|110|F}} on July 10, 1936 in [[Runyon, New Jersey|Runyon]], Middlesex County and {{Convert|-34|F}} on January 5, 1904 in [[River Vale, New Jersey|River Vale]], Bergen County.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/extremes/scec/records|title=State Climate Extremes Committee (SCEC)|author=[[National Climatic Data Center]]|accessdate=April 3, 2015}}</ref>

Average annual precipitation ranges from {{convert|43|to|51|in|mm}}, uniformly spread through the year. Average snowfall per winter season ranges from {{convert|10|-|15|in|cm}} in the south and near the seacoast, {{convert|15|-|30|in|cm}} in the northeast and central part of the state, to about {{convert|40|-|50|in|m}} in the northwestern highlands, but this often varies considerably from year to year. Precipitation falls on an average of 120 days a year, with 25 to 30 thunderstorms, most of which occur during the summer.

During winter and early spring, New Jersey can experience "[[nor'easter]]s," which are capable of causing [[blizzards]] or flooding throughout the northeastern United States. [[Hurricane]]s and [[tropical storm]]s (such as Tropical Storm Floyd in 1999<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.erh.noaa.gov/mhx/Floyd/Impacts.php|title=Hurricane Floyd Impacts|publisher=National Weather Service|accessdate=June 5, 2011}}</ref>), [[tornado]]es, and earthquakes are rare, although New Jersey was severely impacted by [[Hurricane Sandy]] on October 29, 2012 with the storm making landfall in the state at 90&nbsp;mph.

For its overall population and nation-leading population density, New Jersey has a relative paucity of classic large cities. This paradox is most pronounced in [[Bergen County, New Jersey|Bergen County]], New Jersey's most populous county, whose more than 930,000 residents in 2014 inhabited 70 municipalities, the most populous being [[Hackensack, New Jersey|Hackensack]], with 44,519 residents estimated in 2014. Many urban areas extend far beyond the limits of a single large city, as New Jersey cities (and indeed municipalities in general) tend to be geographically small; three of the four largest cities in New Jersey by population have under 20 square miles of land area, and eight of the top ten, including all of the top five have land area under 30 square miles. {{As of|2010|alt=As of the [[United States 2010 Census]]}}, only<!--not POV at all. Regular use of "only" as a comparative--> four municipalities had populations in excess of 100,000, although Edison and Woodbridge came very close.

[[File:Map of Income by Location in New Jersey.png|thumb|left|upright=1.2|A heat map showing median income distribution by county in New Jersey.]]

===Fiscal policy===
New Jersey has seven [[tax bracket]]s that determine [[state income tax]] rates, which range from 1.4% (for income below $20,000) to 8.97% (for income above $500,000).<ref>[http://www.state.nj.us/treasury/taxation/pdf/current/njtaxratesch.pdf New Jersey Tax Rate Schedules 2017], [[New Jersey Department of Treasury]]. Retrieved February 26, 2018.</ref>

The standard [[sales tax]] rate as of January 1, 2018, is 6.625%, applicable to all retail sales unless specifically exempt by law. This rate, which is comparably lower than that of New York City, often attracts numerous shoppers from New York City, often to suburban [[Paramus]], New Jersey, which has five malls, one of which (the [[Garden State Plaza]]) has over two million square feet of retail space. [[Tax exemption]]s include most food items for at-home preparation, medications, most clothing, footwear and disposable paper products for use in the home.<ref>[http://www.state.nj.us/treasury/taxation/pdf/pubs/sales/su4.pdf New Jersey Sales Tax Guide], [[New Jersey Department of Treasury]]. Retrieved February 26, 2018.</ref> There are 27 [[Urban Enterprise Zone]] statewide, including sections of [[Paterson, New Jersey|Paterson]], [[Elizabeth, New Jersey|Elizabeth]], and [[Jersey City, New Jersey|Jersey City]]. In addition to other benefits to encourage employment within the zone, shoppers can take advantage of a reduced 3.3125% [[sales tax]] rate (half the rate rate charged statewide) at eligible merchants.<ref>[http://www.nj.gov/njbusiness/financing/uez/ Urban Enterprise Zone Program], State of New Jersey.

New Jersey has the highest cumulative tax rate of all 50 states with residents paying a total of $68&nbsp;billion in state and local taxes annually with a per capita burden of $7,816 at a rate of 12.9% of income.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://247wallst.com/2011/07/21/108558/3/|title=States Where People Pay The Most (And Least) In Taxes |publisher=24/7 Wall St.|date=July 21, 2011|accessdate=May 17, 2012}}</ref> All [[real property]] located in the state is subject to [[property tax]] unless specifically exempted by statute.

===Federal taxation disparity===
New Jersey consistently ranks as having one of the highest proportional levels of disparity of any state in the United States, based upon what it receives from the federal government relative to what it gives. In 2015, WalletHub ranked New Jersey the state least dependent upon federal government aid overall and having the fourth lowest return on taxpayer investment from the federal government, at 48 cents per dollar.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://wallethub.com/edu/states-most-least-dependent-on-the-federal-government/2700/#main-findings|title=2015's States Most & Least Dependent on the Federal Government|publisher=Evolution Finance|accessdate=April 26, 2015}}</ref>

As shown by the study, incomes tend to be higher in New Jersey, which puts those in higher tax brackets especially vulnerable to the [[alternative minimum tax]].

New Jersey's economy is multifaceted, but is centered on the [[pharmaceutical industry]], the [[financial industry]], chemical development, telecommunications, food processing, electric equipment, printing, publishing, and tourism. New Jersey's agricultural outputs are nursery stock, horses, vegetables, fruits and nuts, seafood, and dairy products.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.njbiz.com/article/20170613/NJBIZ01/170619950/maersk-aims-to-shore-up-nj-shipping-industry-with-direct-financing-service.|title=Maersk aims to shore up N.J. shipping industry with direct financing service – NJBIZ}}</ref> New Jersey ranks second among states in [[blueberry]] production, third in [[cranberry|cranberries]] and [[spinach]], and fourth in [[bell peppers]], [[peach]]es, and [[lettuce|head lettuce]].<ref>{{cite news|author=Judith H.

Although New Jersey is home to many energy-intensive industries, its energy consumption is only 2.7% of the U.S. total, and its [[carbon dioxide emissions]] are 0.8% of the U.S. total. Its comparatively low [[greenhouse gas]] emissions can be attributed to the state's use of [[nuclear power]]. According to the [[Energy Information Administration]], nuclear power dominates New Jersey's electricity market, typically supplying more than one-half of state generation. New Jersey has three nuclear power plants, including the [[Oyster Creek Nuclear Generating Station]], which came online in 1969 and is the oldest operating nuclear plant in the country.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://tonto.eia.doe.gov/state/state_energy_profiles.cfm?sid=NJ|title=EIA State Energy Profiles: New Jersey|date=June 12, 2008|accessdate=June 23, 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080507034707/http://tonto.eia.doe.gov/state/state_energy_profiles.cfm?sid=NJ#|archive-date=May 7, 2008|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}</ref>

New Jersey has a strong scientific economy and is home to major pharmaceutical and telecommunications firms, drawing on the state's large and well-educated labor pool. There is also a strong service economy in retail sales, education, and real estate, serving residents who work in New York City or Philadelphia.

Motion picture technology was developed by [[Thomas Edison]], with much of his early work done at his [[West Orange, New Jersey|West Orange]] laboratory. [[Edison's Black Maria]] was the first motion picture studio. [[America's first motion picture industry]] started in 1907 in [[Fort Lee, New Jersey|Fort Lee]] and the first studio was constructed there in 1909.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fortleefilm.org/|title=Fort Lee Film Commission &#124; Fort Lee, NJ|publisher=Fortleefilm.org|accessdate=May 17, 2012}}</ref> [[DuMont Laboratories]] in [[Passaic, New Jersey|Passaic]] developed early sets and made the first broadcast to the private home.

The [[New Jersey Turnpike]] is one of the most prominent and heavily trafficked roadways in the United States. This [[toll road]], which overlaps with [[Interstate 95 in New Jersey|Interstate 95]] for much of its length, carries traffic between [[Delaware]] and New York, and up and down the [[East Coast of the United States|East Coast]] in general. Commonly referred to as simply "the Turnpike," it is known for its numerous [[rest area]]s named after prominent New Jerseyans.

The [[Garden State Parkway]], or simply "the Parkway," carries relatively more in-state traffic than interstate traffic and runs from New Jersey's northern border to its southernmost tip at [[Cape May, New Jersey|Cape May]]. It is the main route that connects the [[New York metropolitan area]] to the [[Jersey Shore]] and is consistently one of the safest roads in the nation. With a total of 15 travel and 6 shoulder lanes, the [[Driscoll Bridge]] on the Parkway, spanning the [[Raritan River]] in [[Middlesex County, New Jersey|Middlesex County]], is the widest motor vehicle bridge in the world by number of lanes as well as one of the busiest.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tollroadsnews.com/node/1492|title=Garden State Parkway opens world's widest bridge – 15 lanes|author=Peter Samuel|date=April 11, 2006|publisher=TOLLROADSnews|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120323215304/https://www.tollroadsnews.com/node/1492|archivedate=March 23, 2012|deadurl=yes|accessdate=June 6, 2011}}</ref>

New Jersey is connected to New York City via various key bridges and tunnels. The double-decked [[George Washington Bridge]] carries the heaviest load of motor vehicle traffic of any bridge in the world, at 102 million vehicles per year, across fourteen lanes.<ref name="panynj.gov"/><ref name=abcgwb/> It connects [[Fort Lee, New Jersey]] to the [[Washington Heights, Manhattan|Washington Heights]] neighborhood of [[Upper Manhattan]], and carries [[Interstate 95]] and [[U.S. Route 1/9]] across the [[Hudson River]]. The [[Lincoln Tunnel]] connects to [[Midtown Manhattan]] carrying [[New Jersey Route 495]], and the [[Holland Tunnel]] connects to [[Lower Manhattan]] carrying [[Interstate 78 in New Jersey|Interstate 78]]. New Jersey is also connected to [[Staten Island]] by three bridges&nbsp;– from north to south, the [[Bayonne Bridge]], the [[Goethals Bridge]], and the [[Outerbridge Crossing]].

New Jersey has [[interstate compact]]s with all three of its neighboring states. The [[Port Authority of New York and New Jersey]], the [[Delaware River Port Authority]] (with [[Pennsylvania]]), the [[Delaware River Joint Toll Bridge Commission]] (with Pennsylvania), and the [[Delaware River and Bay Authority]] (with [[Delaware]]) operate most of the major transportation routes in and out of the state. Bridge tolls are collected only from traffic exiting the state, with the exception of the private [[Dingman's Ferry Bridge]] over the Delaware River, which charges a toll in both directions.

It is unlawful for a customer to serve themselves gasoline in New Jersey. It became the last remaining U.S. state where all [[Filling station|gas stations]] are required to sell full-service gasoline to customers at all times in 2016, after [[Oregon]]'s introduction of restricted self-service gasoline availability took effect.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hoodrivernews.com/news/2016/jan/06/self-serve-gas-legal-rural-oregon/|author=Patrick Mulvihill|title=Self-serve gas legal in rural Oregon|publisher=Eagle Newspapers, Inc|date=January 5, 2016 |accessdate=April 24, 2016}}</ref>

===Airports===

[[Newark Liberty International Airport]] is one of the [[List of the busiest airports in the United States|busiest airports]] in the United States. Operated by the [[Port Authority of New York and New Jersey]], it is one of the three main airports serving the New York City area. [[United Airlines]] is the airport's largest tenant, operating an entire terminal there, which it uses as one of its primary [[Airline hub|hubs]]. [[FedEx Express]] operates a large cargo terminal at Newark as well. The adjacent [[Newark Liberty International Airport (NJT station)|Newark Airport railroad station]] provides access to [[Amtrak]] and [[NJ Transit]] trains along the [[Northeast Corridor Line]].

Two smaller commercial airports, [[Atlantic City International Airport]] and [[Trenton-Mercer Airport]], also operate in other parts of the state. [[Teterboro Airport]] in [[Bergen County, New Jersey|Bergen County]], and [[Millville Municipal Airport]] in [[Cumberland County, New Jersey|Cumberland County]], are [[general aviation]] airports popular with private and corporate aircraft due to their proximity to New York City and the [[Jersey Shore]], respectively.

{{Further|New Jersey Transit Bus Operations|New Jersey Transit Rail Operations|Port Authority Trans-Hudson|PATCO Speedline}}[[File:Hudson bergen exchange place.jpg|thumb|right|Two [[Hudson-Bergen Light Rail]] trains in [[Jersey City]], New Jersey]]

[[NJ Transit]] operates extensive rail and bus service throughout the state. A state-run corporation, it began with the consolidation of several private bus companies in [[North Jersey]] in 1979. In the early 1980s, it acquired [[Conrail]]'s commuter train operations that connected suburban towns to New York City. Today, NJ Transit has eleven [[commuter rail]] lines that run through different parts of the state. Most of the lines end at either New York's [[Pennsylvania Station (New York City)|Penn Station]] or [[Hoboken, New Jersey|Hoboken's]] [[Hoboken Terminal]]. One line provides service between [[Atlantic City, New Jersey|Atlantic City]] and [[Philadelphia]], Pennsylvania.

NJ Transit also operates three [[light rail]] systems in the state. The [[Hudson-Bergen Light Rail]] connects [[Bayonne, New Jersey|Bayonne]] to [[North Bergen, New Jersey|North Bergen]], through [[Hoboken, New Jersey|Hoboken]] and [[Jersey City, New Jersey|Jersey City]]. The [[Newark Light Rail]] is partially underground, and connects downtown [[Newark, New Jersey|Newark]] with other parts of the city. The [[River Line (New Jersey Transit)|River Line]] connects [[Trenton, New Jersey|Trenton]] and [[Camden, New Jersey|Camden]].

The [[Port Authority Trans-Hudson|PATH]] is a [[rapid transit]] system consisting of four lines operated by the [[Port Authority of New York and New Jersey]]. It links [[Hoboken, New Jersey|Hoboken]], [[Jersey City, New Jersey|Jersey City]], [[Harrison, New Jersey|Harrison]] and [[Newark, New Jersey|Newark]] with New York City. The [[PATCO Speedline]] is a rapid transit system that links [[Camden County, New Jersey|Camden County]] to Philadelphia. Both the PATCO and the PATH are two of only six rapid transit systems in the United States to operate 24 hours a day.

[[Amtrak]] operates numerous long-distance passenger trains in New Jersey, both to and from neighboring states and around the country. In addition to the Newark Airport connection, other major Amtrak railway stations include [[Trenton (Amtrak station)|Trenton Transit Center]], [[Metropark (NJT station)|Metropark]], and the historic [[Pennsylvania Station (Newark)|Newark Penn Station]].

The [[SEPTA|Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority]], or SEPTA, has two commuter rail lines that operate into New Jersey. The [[Trenton Line (SEPTA)|Trenton Line]] terminates at the [[Trenton Transit Center]], and the [[West Trenton Line (SEPTA)|West Trenton Line]] terminates at the [[West Trenton Rail Station]] in [[Ewing, New Jersey|Ewing]].

[[AirTrain Newark]] is a [[monorail]] connecting the Amtrak/NJ Transit station on the Northeast Corridor to the airport's terminals and parking lots.

Some private bus carriers still remain in New Jersey. Most of these carriers operate with state funding to offset losses and state owned buses are provided to these carriers, of which [[Coach USA]] companies make up the bulk. Other carriers include private charter and tour bus operators that take gamblers from other parts of New Jersey, New York City, Philadelphia, and [[Delaware]] to the casino resorts of Atlantic City.[[File:MVCapeHenlopen.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Cape May–Lewes Ferry]] connects New Jersey and [[Delaware]] across the [[Delaware Bay]]]]

===Ferries===
[[NY Waterway|New York Waterway]] has ferry terminals at [[Belford, New Jersey|Belford]], [[Jersey City]], Hoboken, [[Weehawken]], and [[Edgewater, New Jersey|Edgewater]], with service to different parts of Manhattan. [[Liberty Water Taxi]] in [[Jersey City]] has ferries from [[Paulus Hook]] and [[Liberty State Park]] to [[Battery Park City]] in Manhattan. [[Statue Cruises]] offers service from Liberty State Park to the [[Statue of Liberty National Monument]], including [[Ellis Island]]. [[SeaStreak]] offers services from the [[Raritan Bayshore]] to Manhattan, [[Martha's Vineyard]], and [[Nantucket]].

On the [[Delaware Bay]], the [[Delaware River and Bay Authority]] operates the [[Cape May–Lewes Ferry]], carrying both passengers and vehicles from New Jersey to Deleware. The agency also operates the [[Forts Ferry Crossing]] for passengers across the [[Delaware River]]. The [[Delaware River Port Authority]] operates the [[RiverLink Ferry]] between the [[Camden, New Jersey|Camden]] waterfront and [[Penn's Landing]] in Philadelphia.

<!--spills over into History too much IMO. This should be about modern day structure--->
The position of Governor of New Jersey has been considered one of the most powerful in the nation. Until 2010, the governor was the only statewide elected executive official in the state and appointed numerous government officials. Formerly, an acting governor was even more powerful as he simultaneously served as President of the [[New Jersey State Senate]], thus directing half of the legislative and all of the executive process. In 2002 and 2007, President of the State Senate [[Richard Codey]] held the position of acting governor for a short time, and from 2004 to 2006 Codey became a long-term acting governor due to [[Jim McGreevey]]'s resignation. A 2005 amendment to the state Constitution prevents the Senate President from becoming acting governor in the event of a permanent gubernatorial vacancy without giving up her or his seat in the state Senate. [[Phil Murphy]] ([[Democratic Party (United States)|D]]) is the [[Governor of New Jersey|Governor]]. The governor's mansion is [[Drumthwacket]], located in [[Princeton, New Jersey|Princeton]].

Before 2010, New Jersey was one of the few states without a [[Lieutenant governor (United States)|lieutenant governor]]. [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] [[Kim Guadagno]] was elected the first [[Lieutenant Governor of New Jersey]] and took office on January 19, 2010. She was elected on the Republican ticket with Governor-Elect [[Chris Christie]] in the November 2009 NJ gubernatorial election. The position was created as the result of a [[Constitutional amendment]] to the [[New Jersey State Constitution]] passed by the voters on November 8, 2005 and effective as of January 17, 2006.

===Legislative===
{{Main|New Jersey Legislature|2006 New Jersey State Government Shutdown}}
[[File:New Jersey State House.jpg|thumb|The [[New Jersey State House]] is topped by its golden dome in [[Trenton, New Jersey|Trenton]].]]
The current version of the [[New Jersey State Constitution]] was adopted in 1947. It provides for a [[bicameral]] [[New Jersey Legislature]], consisting of an [[upper house]] [[New Jersey Senate|Senate]] of 40 members and a [[lower house]] [[New Jersey General Assembly|General Assembly]] of 80 members. Each of the 40 legislative districts elects one State Senator and two Assembly members. Assembly members are elected for a two-year term in all odd-numbered years; State Senators are elected in the years ending in 1, 3, and 7 and thus serve either four- or two-year terms.

New Jersey is one of only<!--purely comparative, with no judgement value--> five states that elects its state officials in odd-numbered years. (The others are [[Kentucky]], [[Louisiana]], [[Mississippi]], and [[Virginia]].) New Jersey holds elections for these offices every four years, in the year following each federal Presidential election year. Thus, the last year when New Jersey elected a Governor was 2017; the next gubernatorial election will occur in 2021.

===Judicial===
{{main|Judiciary of New Jersey}}

The [[New Jersey Supreme Court]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.judiciary.state.nj.us/supreme/index.htm|title=Supreme Court of New Jersey|publisher=Judiciary.state.nj.us|accessdate=July 25, 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081216011351/http://www.judiciary.state.nj.us/supreme/index.htm|archivedate=December 16, 2008}}</ref> consists of a Chief Justice and six Associate Justices. All are appointed by the Governor with the [[advice and consent]] of a majority of the membership of the State Senate. Justices serve an initial seven-year term, after which they can be reappointed to serve until age 70.

Most of the day-to-day work in the New Jersey courts is carried out in the Municipal Court, where simple traffic tickets, minor criminal offenses, and small civil matters are heard.

More serious criminal and civil cases are handled by the [[New Jersey Superior Court|Superior Court]] for each county. All Superior Court judges are appointed by the Governor with the [[advice and consent]] of a majority of the membership of the State Senate. Each judge serves an initial seven-year term, after which he or she can be reappointed to serve until age 70. New Jersey's judiciary is unusual in that it still has separate courts of law and [[equity (law)|equity]], like its neighbor [[Delaware]] but unlike most other U.S. states. The [[New Jersey Superior Court]] is divided into Law and Chancery Divisions at the trial level; the Law Division hears both criminal cases and civil lawsuits where the plaintiff's primary remedy is [[damages]], while the Chancery Division hears family cases, civil suits where the plaintiff's primary remedy is equitable relief, and probate trials.

The Superior Court also has an [[New Jersey Superior Court, Appellate Division|Appellate Division]], which functions as the state's intermediate [[appellate court]]. Superior Court judges are assigned to the Appellate Division by the Chief Justice.

There is also a Tax Court, which is a court of limited jurisdiction. Tax Court judges hear appeals of tax decisions made by County Boards of Taxation. They also hear appeals on decisions made by the Director of the Division of Taxation on such matters as state income, sales and business taxes, and homestead rebates. Appeals from Tax Court decisions are heard in the Appellate Division of Superior Court. Tax Court judges are appointed by the Governor for initial terms of seven years, and upon reappointment are granted tenure until they reach the mandatory retirement age of 70. There are 12 Tax Court judgeships.

===Counties===
{{Further|List of New Jersey counties}}
New Jersey is divided into 21 counties; 13 date from the colonial era. New Jersey was completely divided into counties by 1692; the present counties were created by dividing the existing ones; most recently [[Union County, New Jersey|Union County]] in 1857. New Jersey is the only state in the nation where elected county officials are called "Freeholders," governing each county as part of its own [[Board of Chosen Freeholders]]. The number of freeholders in each county is determined by referendum, and must consist of three, five, seven or nine members.

Depending on the county, the executive and [[legislative]] functions may be performed by the Board of Chosen Freeholders or split into separate branches of government. In 16 counties, members of the Board of Chosen Freeholders perform both legislative and executive functions on a commission basis, with each Freeholder assigned responsibility for a department or group of departments. In the other 5 counties ([[Atlantic County, New Jersey|Atlantic]], [[Bergen County, New Jersey|Bergen]], [[Essex County, New Jersey|Essex]], [[Hudson County, New Jersey|Hudson]] and [[Mercer County, New Jersey|Mercer]]), there is a directly elected [[County Executive]] who performs the executive functions while the Board of Chosen Freeholders retains a legislative and oversight role. In counties without an Executive, a County Administrator (or County Manager) may be hired to perform day-to-day administration of county functions.

===Municipalities===
New Jersey currently has 565 municipalities; the number was 566 before [[Princeton Township, New Jersey|Princeton Township]] and [[Princeton Borough, New Jersey|Princeton Borough]] merged to form the municipality of [[Princeton, New Jersey|Princeton]] on January 1, 2013. Unlike other states, all New Jersey land is part of a municipality. In 2008, Governor [[Jon Corzine]] proposed cutting state aid to all towns under 10,000 people, to encourage mergers to reduce administrative costs.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=90090911|title=Small Towns in N.J.

====Forms of municipal government====
{{NJmunigov}}
Starting in the 20th century, largely driven by reform-minded goals, a series of six modern forms of government was implemented. This began with the [[Walsh Act (New Jersey)|Walsh Act]], enacted in 1911 by the [[New Jersey Legislature]], which provided for a three- or five-member commission elected on a non-partisan basis. This was followed by the [[1923 Municipal Manager Law]], which offered a non-partisan council, provided for a weak mayor elected by and from the members of the council, and introduced a [[Council-manager government]] structure with an appointed manager responsible for day-to-day administration of municipal affairs.

The [[Faulkner Act (New Jersey)|Faulkner Act]], originally enacted in 1950 and substantially amended in 1981, offers four basic plans: [[Faulkner Act (Mayor-Council)|Mayor-Council]], [[Faulkner Act (Council-Manager)|Council-Manager]], [[Faulkner Act (Small Municipality)|Small Municipality]], and [[Faulkner Act (Mayor-Council-Administrator)|Mayor-Council-Administrator]]. The act provides many choices for communities with a preference for a strong executive and professional management of municipal affairs and offers great flexibility in allowing municipalities to select the characteristics of its government: the number of seats on the Council; seats selected at-large, by wards, or through a combination of both; staggered or concurrent terms of office; and a mayor chosen by the Council or elected directly by voters. Most large municipalities and a majority of New Jersey's residents are governed by municipalities with Faulkner Act charters. Municipalities can also formulate their own unique form of government and operate under a [[Special Charter (New Jersey)|Special Charter]] with the approval of the [[New Jersey Legislature]].{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}

While municipalities retain their names derived from types of government, they may have changed to one of the modern forms of government, or further in the past to one of the other traditional forms, leading to municipalities with formal names quite baffling to the general public. For example, though there are four municipalities that are officially of the village type, [[Loch Arbour, New Jersey|Loch Arbour]] is the only one remaining with the village form of government. The other three villages – [[Ridgefield Park, New Jersey|Ridgefield Park]] (now with a Walsh Act form), [[Ridgewood, New Jersey|Ridgewood]] (now with a Faulkner Act Council-Manager charter) and [[South Orange, New Jersey|South Orange]] (now operates under a [[Special Charter (New Jersey)|Special Charter]]) – have all migrated to other non-village forms.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}

====Social attitudes and issues====
Socially, New Jersey is considered one of the more liberal states in the nation. Polls indicate that 60% of the population are self-described as [[pro-choice]], although a majority are opposed to late trimester and [[intact dilation and extraction]] and public funding of abortion.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.catholicnewsagency.com/new.php?n=17086|title=Poll says majority of Americans opposed to abortion funding in health care bill :: Catholic News Agency (CNA)|agency=Catholic News Agency|accessdate=July 25, 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.surveyusa.com/50State2005/50StateAbortion0805SortedbyState.htm|title=SurveyUSA Pro-Life vs. Pro Choice Sorted by State|publisher=Surveyusa.com|accessdate=July 25, 2010}}</ref> In a 2009 [[Quinnipiac University Polling Institute]] poll, a plurality supported [[same-sex marriage in New Jersey|same-sex marriage]] 49% to 43% opposed,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://abclocal.go.com/wpvi/story?section=news/local&id=6776022&rss=rss-wpvi-article-6776022|title=Poll: NJ voters support gay marriage|publisher=Abclocal.go.com|date=April 23, 2009|accessdate=January 23, 2011}}</ref> On October 18, 2013, the [[New Jersey Supreme Court]] rendered a provisional, unanimous (7–0 vote) order authorizing same-sex marriage in the state, pending a legal appeal by Governor Chris Christie,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nj.com/politics/index.ssf/2013/10/nj_supreme_court_gay_marriage_christie.html#incart_m-rpt-1|title=Same-sex weddings can begin pending appeal, N.J.

New Jersey also has some of the most stringent [[gun control]] laws in the U.S. These include bans on assault firearms, hollow-nose bullets and even slingshots. No gun offense in New Jersey is graded less than a felony. [[BB guns]] and black-powder guns are all treated as modern firearms. New Jersey does not recognize out-of-state gun licenses and aggressively enforces its own gun laws.<ref>[http://www.nraila.org/statelawpdfs/NJSL.pdf NRAILA.org] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111210170131/http://www.nraila.org/statelawpdfs/NJSL.pdf |date=December 10, 2011 }}</ref>

[[File:United States presidential election in New Jersey, 2016.svg|thumb|left|[[Treemap]] of the popular vote by county, 2016 presidential election.]]

In past elections, New Jersey was a [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] bastion, but recently has become a [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] stronghold. Currently, [[New Jersey Democratic State Committee|New Jersey Democrats]] have majority control of both houses of the [[New Jersey Legislature]] (Senate, 24–16, and Assembly, 47–33), a 7–5 split of the state's twelve seats in the [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. House of Representatives]], and both [[United States Senate|U.S. Senate]] seats. Although the Democratic Party is very successful statewide, the state had a Republican governor from 1994 to 2002, as [[Christine Todd Whitman]] won twice with 47% and 49% of the votes, and in the [[2009 New Jersey gubernatorial election|2009 gubernatorial election]], Republican [[Chris Christie]] defeated incumbent Democrat [[Jon Corzine]] with 48%. In the [[2013 New Jersey Gubernatorial election|2013 gubernatorial election]], Christie won reelection with over 60% of the votes. Because each candidate for lieutenant governor runs on the same ticket as the party's candidate for governor, the current Governor and Lieutenant Governor are members of the Democratic Party. The governor's appointments to cabinet and non-cabinet positions may be from either party; for instance, the Attorney General is a Democrat.

In federal elections, the state leans heavily towards the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]]. For many years in the past, however, it was a Republican stronghold, having given comfortable margins of victory to the Republican candidate in the close elections of [[United States presidential election, 1948|1948]], [[United States presidential election, 1968|1968]], and [[United States presidential election, 1976|1976]]. New Jersey was a crucial [[swing state]] in the elections of [[United States presidential election, 1960|1960]], [[United States presidential election, 1968|1968]], and [[United States presidential election, 1992|1992]]. The last elected Republican to hold a Senate seat from New Jersey was [[Clifford P. Case]] in 1979. Newark Mayor [[Cory Booker]] was elected in October 2013 to join [[Bob Menendez|Robert Menendez]] to make New Jersey the first state with concurrent serving black and Latino U.S. senators.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.nj.com/politics/index.ssf/2013/10/booker_and_menendez_form_historic_duo_as_first_black_and_latino_senators_from_the_same_state.html|title=Booker and Menendez form historic duo as first black and Latino senators from the same state|author=David Giambusso|newspaper=The Star-Ledger|date=October 20, 2013|accessdate=October 20, 2013}}</ref>

The state's Democratic strongholds include [[Camden County, New Jersey|Camden County]], [[Essex County, New Jersey|Essex County]] (typically the state's most Democratic county—it includes [[Newark, New Jersey|Newark]], the state's largest city), [[Hudson County, New Jersey|Hudson County]] (the second-strongest Democratic county, including [[Jersey City, New Jersey|Jersey City]], the state's second-largest city); [[Mercer County, New Jersey|Mercer County]] (especially around [[Trenton, New Jersey|Trenton]] and [[Princeton, New Jersey|Princeton]]), [[Middlesex County, New Jersey|Middlesex County]], and [[Union County, New Jersey|Union County]] (including [[Elizabeth, New Jersey|Elizabeth]], the state's fourth-largest city).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nj.com/politics/index.ssf/2017/05/republican_vs_democratic_which_political_party_dom.html#incart_river_home|title=Your neighbors lean red or blue? How many Republicans and Democrats are in all 21 counties}}</ref>

The suburban northwestern and southeastern counties of the state are reliably Republican: Republicans have support along the coast in [[Ocean County, New Jersey|Ocean County]] and in the mountainous northwestern part of the state, especially [[Morris County, New Jersey|Morris County]], [[Sussex County, New Jersey|Sussex County]], and [[Warren County, New Jersey|Warren County]]. Other suburban counties, especially [[Bergen County, New Jersey|Bergen County]] and [[Burlington County, New Jersey|Burlington County]] had the majority of votes go to the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]]. In the 2008 election, President [[Barack Obama]] won New Jersey with approximately fifty-seven percent of the vote, compared to [[John McCain|McCain's]] forty-one percent. Independent candidate [[Ralph Nader]] garnered less than one percent of the vote.

About one-third of the state's counties are considered "swing" counties, but some go more one way than others. For example, [[Salem County, New Jersey|Salem County]], the same is true with [[Passaic County, New Jersey|Passaic County]], with a highly populated Hispanic Democratic south (including [[Paterson, New Jersey|Paterson]], the state's third-largest city) and a rural, Republican north; with the "swing" township of [[Wayne, New Jersey|Wayne]] in the middle. Other "swing" counties like [[Monmouth County, New Jersey|Monmouth County]], [[Somerset County, New Jersey|Somerset County]], and [[Cape May County, New Jersey|Cape May County]] tend to go Republican, as they also have population in conservative areas, although Somerset has recently trended Democratic.

To be eligible to vote in a U.S. election, all New Jerseyans are required to start their residency in the state 30 days prior to an election and register 21 days prior to election day.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.njelections.org/voting-information.html|title=New Jersey Department of State – Division of Elections|accessdate=March 12, 2017}}</ref>

====Capital punishment====
{{Main|Capital punishment in New Jersey}}
On December 17, 2007, Governor Jon Corzine signed into law a bill that would eliminate the death penalty in New Jersey. New Jersey is the first state to pass such legislation since [[Iowa]] and [[West Virginia]] eliminated executions in 1965.<ref>Hester Jr., Tom (2007), [http://www.nbcnews.com/id/22296966/ns/us_news-crime_and_courts/t/nj-first-state-years-ban-death-penalty/ "N.J. Bans Death Penalty"], Associated Press</ref> Corzine also signed a bill that would downgrade the Death Row prisoners' sentences from "Death" to "Life in Prison with No Parole."<ref>Peters, Jeremy W. "[https://www.nytimes.com/2007/12/18/nyregion/18death.html?pagewanted=print Corzine Signs Bill Ending Executions, Then Commutes Sentences of Eight]." ''[[The New York Times]]''. December 18, 2007.

===Professional sports===
New Jersey currently has four [[Major professional sports leagues in the United States and Canada|major league]] teams based in the state, although only one, the [[National Hockey League]]'s [[New Jersey Devils]], bears the state's name. Since 2007, they have played their home games at the [[Prudential Center]] in [[Newark, New Jersey|Newark]].

The [[New York metropolitan area]]'s two [[National Football League]] teams, the [[New York Giants]] and the [[New York Jets]], both play in [[East Rutherford, New Jersey|East Rutherford]], at [[MetLife Stadium]] in the [[Meadowlands Sports Complex]].<ref>[http://www.newmeadowlandsstadium.com/ New Meadowlands Stadium official website] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141009075832/http://www.newmeadowlandsstadium.com/ |date=October 9, 2014 }} New Meadowlands Stadium Corporation.

The [[New York Red Bulls]] of [[Major League Soccer]] play in [[Red Bull Arena (New Jersey)|Red Bull Arena]], a soccer-specific stadium located in [[Harrison, New Jersey|Harrison]], just outside of downtown Newark.

The Meadowlands Sports Complex is also home to the [[Meadowlands Racetrack]], one of three major [[harness racing]] tracks in the state. That track, along with [[Freehold Raceway]] in [[Freehold Borough, New Jersey|Freehold]], are two of the major harness racing tracks in North America. [[Monmouth Park Racetrack]] in [[Oceanport, New Jersey|Oceanport]] is a popular spot for [[thoroughbred racing|thoroughbred horse racing]]. It hosted the [[Breeders' Cup]] in 2007, and its turf course was renovated in preparation.

Additionally, New Jersey is home to two [[MLB]]-affiliated [[Minor League Baseball]] teams: the [[Trenton Thunder]] ([[New York Yankees]] affiliate) and the [[Lakewood BlueClaws]] ([[Philadelphia Phillies]] affiliate). The state is also home to the [[Can-Am League]] baseball team, the [[New Jersey Jackals]], who play at [[Yogi Berra Stadium]], which is located on the campus of [[Montclair State University]].

New Jerseyans' collegiate allegiances are predominantly split among the four major [[Division I (NCAA)|NCAA Division I]] programs in the state – the [[Seton Hall Pirates|Seton Hall University]] [[Seton Hall Pirates|Pirates]], the [[Rutgers University#Athletics|Rutgers University]] [[Rutgers Scarlet Knights|Scarlet Knights]], the [[NJIT Highlanders]], and the [[Princeton University#Athletics|Princeton University]] [[Princeton Tigers|Tigers]]. Rutgers joined the [[Big Ten Conference]] in 2014.

Seton Hall's basketball team has been one of the most storied programs in the Big East Conference,{{citation needed|date=May 2014}} and it plays its home games at the [[Prudential Center]] in [[Newark, New Jersey|Newark]]. The Hall have 3 Big East Tournament Championships with wins in 1991, 1993 and most recently in 2016. Seton Hall was the national runner-up in the 1989 NCAA Tournament when they lost to the Michigan Wolverines in overtime. The Pirates made a huge comeback as a program in 2014 with a top-5 recruiting class nationally. The Pirates have support in the predominantly Roman Catholic areas of the northern part of the state and the [[Jersey Shore]].{{citation needed|date=May 2014}}

Rutgers and Princeton have an intense rivalry – stemming from the [[1869 college football season|first intercollegiate football game]] in 1869 – though the two schools have not met on the football field since 1980. They continue to play each other annually in other sports.

Rutgers, which fields 24 teams in various sports, is nationally known for its excellent football and women's basketball programs.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}} The university is planning an expansion to [[Rutgers Stadium]], and the teams play in [[Piscataway Township, New Jersey|Piscataway]], which is adjacent to the New Brunswick campus. The university also fields rising basketball and baseball programs.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}} Rutgers' fan base is mostly derived from the western parts of the state and [[Middlesex County, New Jersey|Middlesex County]],{{citation needed|date=May 2014}} and its alumni base is the largest in the state.
