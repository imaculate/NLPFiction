'''Annapolis''' ({{IPAc-en|ə|ˈ|n|æ|p|əl|ᵻ|s}}) is the capital of the U.S. state of [[Maryland]], as well as the [[county seat]] of [[Anne Arundel County, Maryland|Anne Arundel County]]. Situated on the [[Chesapeake Bay]] at the mouth of the [[Severn River (Maryland)|Severn River]], {{convert|25|mi|km}} south of [[Baltimore]] and about {{convert|30|mi|km|sigfig=1}} east of [[Washington, D.C.]], Annapolis is part of the [[Baltimore–Washington metropolitan area]]. Its population was measured at 38,394 by the [[2010 United States Census|2010 census]].

This city served as the seat of the [[Confederation Congress]] (former Second [[Continental Congress]]) and temporary national capital of the United States in 1783–1784. At that time, General [[George Washington]] came before the body convened in the new [[Maryland State House]] and [[George Washington's resignation as commander-in-chief|resigned his commission as commander]] of the [[Continental Army]]. A month later, the Congress ratified the [[Treaty of Paris (1783)|Treaty of Paris]] of 1783, ending the [[American Revolutionary War]], with [[Kingdom of Great Britain|Great Britain]] recognizing the independence of the United States.
The city and state capitol  was also the site of the [[Annapolis Convention (1786)|1786 Annapolis Convention]], which issued a call to the states to send delegates for the [[Constitutional Convention (United States)|Constitutional Convention]] to be held the following year in [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania|Philadelphia]]. Over 220 years later, the [[Annapolis Conference|Annapolis Peace Conference]], was held in 2007. Annapolis is the home of [[St. John's College (Annapolis/Santa Fe)|St. John's College]], founded 1696; the [[United States Naval Academy]], established 1845, is adjacent to the city limits.<!--USN is not in the Annapolis city limits: https://www.annapolis.gov/DocumentCenter/View/6004/ZoningStreetIndex2016?bidId=-->

==History==

===Colonial and early United States (1649–1808)===
[[File:Annapolis Old Treasury Building from 1735 by D Ramey Logan.jpg|thumb|The "Old Treasury Building" on State Circle (adjacent to the [[Maryland State House]]) was built in 1735 and is the oldest standing government building in Annapolis.]]
[[File:View of Annapolis in 1797 (NYPL b12612010-423603).tiff|thumb|''View of Annapolis in 1797'', [[New York Public Library]]]]
A settlement in the [[Province of Maryland]] named "Providence" was founded on the north shore of the [[Severn River (Maryland)|Severn River]] on the middle [[Western Shore of Maryland|Western Shore]] of the [[Chesapeake Bay]] in 1649 by [[Puritan]] exiles from [[Colony of Virginia|the Province/Dominion of Virginia]] led by third Proprietary Governor [[William Stone (Maryland governor)|William Stone]] (1603–1660). The settlers later moved to a better-protected harbor on the south shore. The settlement on the south shore was initially named "Town at Proctor's," then "Town at the Severn," and later "[[Anne Arundel]]'s Towne" (after Lady [[Anne Arundell|Ann Arundell]] (1616-1649), the wife of [[Cecil Calvert, 2nd Baron Baltimore|Cecilus Calvert, second Lord Baltimore]], who died soon afterwards).<ref name="Annals">{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Annals_of_Annapolis.html?id=ycoLAAAAYAAJ|title=Annals of Annapolis|editor=David Ridgely|publisher=Cushing & Brother|year=1841|pages=34, 35}}</ref>

In 1654, after the [[Third English Civil War]], [[Parliamentary]] forces assumed control of the Maryland colony and Stone went into exile further south across the [[Potomac River]] in [[Virginia]]. Per orders from [[Charles Calvert, 5th Baron Baltimore|Charles Calvert, fifth Lord Baltimore]], Stone returned the following spring at the head of a [[Cavalier]] royalist force, loyal to the  [[King of England]].  On March 25, 1655, in what is known as the [[Battle of the Severn]] (first colonial naval battle in [[North America]]), Stone was defeated, taken prisoner, and replaced by [[Josias Fendall|Lt. Gen. Josias Fendall]] (1628–1687) as fifth Proprietary [[Governor of Maryland|Governor]]. Fendall governed Maryland during the latter half of the [[English Commonwealth|Commonwealth]] period in [[England]]. In 1660, he was replaced by [[Phillip Calvert (governor)|Phillip Calvert]] (1626–1682) as fifth/sixth [[Governor of Maryland]], after the [[restoration (Colonies)|restoration]] of [[Charles II of England|Charles II]] (1630–1685) as [[King of England|King]] in [[Kingdom of England|England]].

In 1694, soon after the overthrow of the Catholic government of second Royal Governor [[Thomas Lawrence (Governor of Maryland)|Thomas Lawrence]] (1645-1714), then third Royal Governor [[Francis Nicholson]] (1655-1727/28, served 1694-1698), moved the capital of the royal colony, the [[Province of Maryland]], to Anne Arundel's Towne and renamed the town Annapolis after [[Anne, Queen of Great Britain|Princess Anne of Denmark and Norway]], soon to be the [[queen regnant|Queen Anne]] of [[Kingdom of Great Britain|Great Britain]] (1665-1714, reigned 1702-1714). Annapolis was incorporated as a city in 1708.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Huston|first=John W.|title=Annapolis: an eighteenth-century analysis|journal=Conspectus of History|year=1977|volume=1|issue=4|page=49|url=http://libx.bsu.edu/cdm4/document.php?CISOROOT=/ConspectusH&CISOPTR=139&REC=1}}</ref>

17th-century Annapolis was little more than a village, but it grew rapidly for most of the 18th century until the [[American Revolutionary War]] as a political and administrative capital, a [[port of entry]], and a major center of the [[Atlantic slave trade]].<ref>{{cite book|last1=McWilliams|first1=Jane W.|title=Annapolis, City on the Severn: A History|date=2011|publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press}}</ref> The ''[[Maryland Gazette]]'', which became an important weekly journal, was founded there by Jonas Green<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bsos.umd.edu/ANTH/aia/Green%20Print%20Shop.htm |title=Green Print Shop |publisher=Archaeology in Annapolis |author=William J.

[[Alexander Hamilton (Maryland doctor)|Dr. Alexander Hamilton]] (1712–1756) was a Scottish-born doctor and writer who lived and worked in Annapolis.  Leo Lemay says his 1744 travel diary ''Gentleman's Progress: The Itinerarium of Dr. Alexander Hamilton'' is "the best single portrait of men and manners, of rural and urban life, of the wide range of society and scenery in colonial America." <ref>J.A.

For the 1783 Congress, the Governor of Maryland commissioned John Shaw, a local cabinet maker, to create an American flag. The flag is slightly different from other designs of the time. The blue field extends over the entire height of the hoist. Shaw created two versions of the flag: one which started with a red stripe and another that started with a white one.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/06/12/AR2009061203917.html|title=A Corrected Replica of the Flag From Maryland's 1783 State House Will Be Raised|work=The Washington Post|date=June 13, 2009|author=Mike Peed}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://msa.maryland.gov/msa/mdstatehouse/pdf/shawflag.pdf|title=A John Shaw Flag for the Maryland State House|publisher=Maryland State Archives|accessdate=January 29, 2014}}</ref>

In 1786, delegates from all states of the Union were invited to meet in Annapolis to consider measures for the better regulation of commerce. Delegates from only five states—[[New York (state)|New York]], [[Pennsylvania]], [[Virginia]], [[New Jersey]], and [[Delaware]]—actually attended the convention, known afterward as the "[[Annapolis Convention (1786)|Annapolis Convention]]." Without proceeding to the business for which they had met, the delegates passed a resolution calling for another convention to meet at [[Philadelphia]] in the following year to amend the Articles of Confederation. The Philadelphia convention drafted and approved the Constitution of the United States, which is still in force.<ref name="EB1911"/>

=== Civil War era (1849 – late 1800s) ===
On April 24, 1861, the midshipmen of the Naval Academy relocated their base in Annapolis and were temporarily housed in Newport, Rhode Island until October 1865.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Munch|first=Vincent A.|date=March 2001|title=NewsLibrary2001145NewsLibrary.

In 1861, the first of three camps that were built for holding paroled soldiers was created on the campus of [[St. John's College (Annapolis/Santa Fe)|St. John's College]]. The second location of [[Camp Parole, Annapolis|Camp Parole]] would house over 20,000 and would be located where Forest Drive is currently. The third and final location was finished in late 1863 and would be placed near the Elkridge Railroad, as to make transportation of soldiers and resources easier before and allowing the camp to grow to its highest numbers.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.3886/icpsr04555|title=Current Population Survey, August 2005: Veterans Supplement|date=2008-04-04|website=ICPSR Data Holdings|access-date=2018-12-09}}</ref> This area just west of the city is still referred to as [[Parole, Maryland|Parole]].

=== Contemporary Era ===
In 1900, Annapolis had a population of 8,585.

On December 21, 1906, Henry Davis was lynched in the city. He was suspected of assaulting a local woman. Nobody was ever tried for the crime.

During World War II, shipyards in Annapolis built a number of PT Boats, and military vessels such as minesweepers and patrol boats were built in Annapolis during the Korean and Vietnam wars. It was at Annapolis in July 1940 that [[Grand Duchess Charlotte of Luxembourg]] arrived in exile during World War II.

In the summer of 1984, the Navy Marine Corps Memorial Stadium in Annapolis hosted soccer games as part of the [[1984 Summer Olympics|XXIII Olympiad]].

During September 18–19, 2003, [[Hurricane Isabel]] created the largest storm surge known in Annapolis's history, cresting at 7.58 ft (2.31 m). Much of downtown Annapolis was flooded and many businesses and homes in outlying areas were damaged. The previous record was 6.35 feet (1.94 m) during a hurricane in 1933, and 5.5 ft (1.7 m) during [[Hurricane Hazel]] in 1954.

From mid-2007 through December 2008, the city celebrated the 300th anniversary of its 1708 Royal Charter, which established democratic self-governance. The many cultural events of this celebration were organized by Annapolis Charter 300.

On June 28th, 2018, at the Capital Gazette, a gunman opened fire, killing five journalists and injuring two more. The perpetrator of the [[Capital Gazette shooting]] was Jarrod Ramos.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/29/us/jarrod-ramos-annapolis-shooting.html|title=Maryland Shooting Suspect Had Long-Running Dispute With Newspaper|last=Williams|first=Timothy|date=2018-06-29|work=The New York Times|access-date=2018-12-09|last2=Harmon|first2=Amy|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}</ref>

====2007 Annapolis Conference====
{{Main|Annapolis Conference}}
As announced by [[United States Secretary of State]] [[Condoleezza Rice]], Annapolis was the venue for a Middle East summit dealing with the [[Israeli–Palestinian peace process]], with the participation of Israeli Prime Minister [[Ehud Olmert]], Palestinian President [[Mahmoud Abbas]] ("[[Abu Mazen]]") and various other leaders from the region. The conference was held on Monday, November 26, 2007.

==Notable institutions==
[[File:Maryland State House from Church Circle.JPG|thumb|right|Maryland State House as seen from Church Circle]]

===The State House===
The [[Maryland State House]] is the oldest in continuous legislative use in the United States. Construction started in 1772, and the Maryland legislature first met there in 1779. It is topped by the largest wooden dome built without nails in the country. The Maryland State House housed the workings of the United States government from November 26, 1783, to August 13, 1784, and the [[Treaty of Paris (1783)|Treaty of Paris]] was ratified there on January 14, 1784, so Annapolis became the first peacetime capital of the U.S.<ref>{{cite web

It was in the Maryland State House that [[George Washington]] famously resigned his commission before the [[Continental Congress]] on December 23, 1783.<ref name="State House" />

===United States Naval Academy===
[[File:bfc annapolis md usna bancroft hall 01w.jpg|thumb|right|US Naval Academy, [[Bancroft Hall]] (c. 1908)]]
The [[United States Naval Academy]] was founded in 1845 on the site of [[Fort Severn]], and now occupies an area of land [[Land reclamation|reclaimed]] from the [[Severn River (Maryland)|Severn River]] next to the [[Chesapeake Bay]]. The Annapolis area was the home of a [[VLF]]-transmitter called [[NSS Annapolis]], which was used by the United States Navy to communicate with its Atlantic submarine fleet. Students that attend the Naval Academy are enrolled in school for four years with a following five year commitment to serving in the Marine Corps or Navy. There is a typical average of around 4,500 students enrolled.

===St. John's College===
[[St. John's College (Annapolis/Santa Fe)|St. John's College]] is a non-sectarian private college that was once supported by the state. It was opened in 1789 as the successor of King William's School, which was founded by an act of the Maryland legislature in 1696 and was opened in 1701. Its principal building, McDowell Hall, was originally to be the governor's mansion; although £4,000 was appropriated to build it in 1742, it was not completed until after the War of Independence.<ref name="EB1911" /><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.stjohnscollege.edu/about/history.shtml|title=A Brief History of St. John’s College|publisher=St. John's College|accessdate=January 29, 2014}}</ref>

St. John's has a second campus in [[Santa Fe, New Mexico|Sante Fe, New Mexico]]. Students are able to choose between the two campuses and switch at any point in their education. The curriculum of St. John's relies heavily on the use of literature with their Great Books Curriculum, which focuses on texts of Western Civilization. Each year, students are required to participate in a seminar-style course to discuss the assigned works. This program has been highlighted as one that is unique to St. John's and requires the students to become well-versed through reading about political science, philosophy, math, language, and many more topics.

===Theater===
Annapolis has a thriving community theater scene which includes two venues in the historic district.

On East Street, [[Colonial Players]] produces approximately six shows a year in its 180-seat theater. ''[[A Christmas Carol]]'' has been a seasonal tradition in Annapolis since it opened at the Colonial Players theater in 1981.

Annapolis often serves as the end point for the 3,000-mile annual transcontinental [[Race Across America]] bicycle race.

To the north of the state house is a monument to [[Thurgood Marshall]], the first black justice of the [[US Supreme Court]] and formerly a Maryland lawyer who won many important [[civil rights]] cases.

Located just before the Naval Academy Bridge is the World War II Memorial, which was constructed in 1998 to symbolize the sacrifice made by the 275,000 citizens from Maryland who joined the service to fight in the war. The memorial is composed of 48 granite columns to represent the 48 states at the time of the war surrounding an amphitheater in which are the names of 6,454 men who gave their lives in the war. Directly behind the memorial are both the Maryland, and United States flags, and a star shaped column with a seven sided base to represent Maryland being the seventh state in the Union.<ref>{{Cite news|url=|title=Around Maryland|last=|first=|date=1995|work=The Washington Post|access-date=}}</ref>

Annapolis lies within the [[humid subtropical climate]] zone ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]] ''Cfa''), with hot, humid summers, cool winters, and generous precipitation year-round. Low elevation and proximity to the Chesapeake Bay give the area more moderate spring and summertime temperatures and slightly less extreme winter lows than locations further inland, such as Washington, D.C.

==Transportation==

===Bus===
The Annapolis Department of Transportation (ADOT) provides bus service with eight routes, collectively branded [[Annapolis Transit]]. The system serves the city with recreational areas, shopping centers, educational and medical facilities, and employment hubs. ADOT also offers transportation for the elderly and persons with disabilities.<ref>[http://www.ci.annapolis.md.us/info.asp?page=1368 Annapolis.md.us] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100107045034/http://www.ci.annapolis.md.us/info.asp?page=1368 |date=January 7, 2010 }}</ref> Several [[Maryland Transit Administration]] commuter buses also allow for access to Baltimore or Washington, D.C.

===Railway===
Annapolis is the only capital city in America east of the [[Mississippi River]] without rail transport of any sort.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}} From 1840 to 1968, Annapolis was connected to the outside world by railroad. The [[Washington, Baltimore and Annapolis Railroad]] (WB&A) operated two electrified [[interurban]] lines that brought passengers into the city from both the South and the North. The southern route ran down King George Street and Main Street, leading directly to the statehouse, while the northern route entered town via [[Glen Burnie]]. In 1935, the WB&A went bankrupt due to the effects of the [[Great Depression]] and suspended service along its southern route, while the newly created [[Baltimore and Annapolis Railroad]] (B&A) retained service on the northern route. Steam trains of the [[Baltimore and Ohio Railroad]] also occasionally operated over the line to Annapolis, primarily for special Naval Academy movements. Passenger rail service on the B&A was eventually discontinued in 1950; freight service ceased in 1968 after the dilapidated trestle crossing the [[Severn River (Maryland)|Severn River]] was condemned. The tracks were eventually dismantled in 1976.<ref>{{Schwieterman-Leaves-Eastern|pages=109–113}}</ref>

==Government==

===City government===
[[File:Annapolis City Hall 2.JPG|thumb|Annapolis City Hall]]
Annapolis is governed via the [[weak mayor]] system. The city council consists of eight aldermen who are elected from single member wards. The mayor is elected directly in a citywide vote.  Since 2008, several aldermen have introduced unsuccessful charter amendments to institute a  [[council-manager]] system, a move opposed by both Democratic mayor [[Joshua J. Cohen]] and his Republican successor [[Mike Pantelides]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://baltimore.cbslocal.com/2013/11/10/annapolis-council-to-consider-stripping-republican-mayor-elects-power/|title=Annapolis Council To Consider Stripping Republican Mayor-Elect’s Power|publisher=}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wbaltv.com/politics/calls-for-weakmayor-system-in-annapolis-come-days-after-election/22917016|title=Calls for weak-mayor system in Annapolis come days after election|author=Lisa Robinson|date=April 15, 2012|work=WBAL-TV}}</ref>

===State government===
The [[Maryland General Assembly|state legislature]], [[Governor of Maryland|governor's office]], and [[Maryland Court of Appeals|appellate courts]] are located in Annapolis. While Annapolis is the state's only [[Capital city|capital]], some administrative offices, including a number of [[cabinet-level departments]], are based in [[Baltimore]].
