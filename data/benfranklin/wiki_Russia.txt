==Etymology==<!-- linked -->
{{Main|Rus' people|Rus' (name)}}
{{See also|Russian (disambiguation)}}
The name ''Russia'' is derived from [[Rus' (name)|Rus']], a medieval state populated mostly by the [[East Slavs]]. However, this proper name became more prominent in the later history, and the country typically was called by its inhabitants "Русская Земля" (russkaja zemlja), which can be translated as "Russian Land" or "Land of Rus'". In order to distinguish this state from other states derived from it, it is denoted as ''[[Kievan Rus']]'' by modern historiography. The [[Rus (name)|name ''Rus'']] itself comes from the early medieval [[Rus' people]], [[Swedes (Germanic tribe)|Swedish]] merchants and warriors<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=Russia |title=Online Etymology Dictionary |publisher=Etymonline.com |accessdate=November 2, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thefreedictionary.com/rus |title=Rus – definition of Rus by the Free Online Dictionary, Thesaurus and Encyclopedia |publisher=Thefreedictionary.com |accessdate=November 2, 2011}}</ref> who relocated from across the Baltic Sea and founded a state centered on [[Novgorod]] that later became [[Kievan Rus]].

An old Latin version of the name Rus' was [[Ruthenia]], mostly applied to the western and southern regions of Rus' that were adjacent to Catholic Europe. The current name of the country, Россия (Rossija), comes from the [[Byzantine Greek]] designation of the [[Rus' (name)|Rus']], Ρωσσία ''Rossía''—spelled Ρωσία (''Rosía'' {{IPA-el|roˈsia|pron}}) in [[Modern Greek]].<ref>{{cite book |title=The Russians: The People of Europe |last=Milner-Gulland |first=R. R. |year=1997 |publisher=Blackwell Publishing |isbn=978-0-631-21849-4 |pages=1–4 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=BgJjHFwmj2UC&pg=PA1|accessdate=December 15, 2016}}</ref>

The standard way to refer to citizens of Russia is "[[citizens of Russia|Russians]]" in English<ref name=merriamwebster>{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/Russian|title=Definition of Russian|publisher=Merriam-Webster|accessdate=September 21, 2016}}</ref> and ''rossiyane'' ({{lang-rus|россияне}}) in Russian. There are two [[Russian language|Russian]] words which are commonly translated into English as "Russians". One is "русские" (''russkiye''), which most often means "ethnic [[Russians]]". Another is "россияне" (''rossiyane''), which means "[[citizens of Russia]], regardless of ethnicity". Translations into other languages often do not distinguish these two groups.

In [[classical antiquity]], the Pontic Steppe was known as [[Scythia]].

In the 11th and 12th centuries, constant incursions by nomadic Turkic tribes, such as the [[Kipchaks]] and the [[Pechenegs]], caused a massive migration of Slavic populations to the safer, heavily forested regions of the north, particularly to the area known as [[Zalesye]].<ref>{{Cite book|author=Klyuchevsky, V.|title=The course of the Russian history|volume=1|url=http://www.kulichki.com/inkwell/text/special/history/kluch/kluch16.htm|isbn=978-5-244-00072-6|year=1987|publisher=Myslʹ}}</ref>

The most powerful state to eventually arise after the destruction of Kievan Rus' was the [[Grand Duchy of Moscow]] ("Muscovy" in the Western chronicles), initially a part of [[Vladimir-Suzdal]]. While still under the domain of the [[Mongol]]-[[Tatars]] and with their connivance, Moscow began to assert its influence in the Central Rus' in the early 14th century, gradually becoming the leading force in the process of the Rus' lands' reunification and expansion of Russia.<ref>Davies B.

Led by Prince [[Dmitry Donskoy]] of Moscow and helped by the [[Russian Orthodox Church]], the united army of Russian principalities inflicted a milestone defeat on the Mongol-Tatars in the [[Battle of Kulikovo]] in 1380. Moscow gradually absorbed the surrounding principalities, including formerly strong rivals such as [[Principality of Tver|Tver]] and [[Novgorod Republic|Novgorod]].

[[Ivan&nbsp;III]] ("the Great") finally threw off the control of the [[Golden Horde]] and consolidated the whole of Central and Northern Rus' under Moscow's dominion. He was also the first to take the title "Grand Duke of all the Russias".<ref>{{cite web

During his long reign, Ivan the Terrible nearly doubled the already large Russian territory by annexing the three Tatar khanates (parts of the disintegrated [[Golden Horde]]): [[Khanate of Kazan|Kazan]] and [[Astrakhan Khanate|Astrakhan]] along the [[Volga River]], and the [[Siberian Khanate]] in southwestern Siberia. Thus, by the end of the 16th century Russia was transformed into a [[multiethnic]], [[Religious denomination|multidenominational]] and [[transcontinental state]].

However, the Tsardom was weakened by the long and unsuccessful [[Livonian War]] against the coalition of Poland, Lithuania, and Sweden for access to the Baltic coast and sea trade.<ref>{{cite book|author=Solovyov, S.|title=History of Russia from the Earliest Times|publisher=AST|year=2001|volume=6|pages=751–908|isbn=978-5-17-002142-0}}</ref> At the same time, the Tatars of the [[Crimean Khanate]], the only remaining successor to the Golden Horde, continued to raid Southern Russia.<ref>{{cite web|author=Eizo Matsuki|url=http://www.econ.hit-u.ac.jp/~areastd/mediterranean/mw/pdf/18/10.pdf|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110501041101/http://www.econ.hit-u.ac.jp/~areastd/mediterranean/mw/pdf/18/10.pdf|archivedate=May 1, 2011|title=The Crimean Tatars and their Russian-Captive Slaves|publisher=Mediterranean Studies Group at Hitotsubashi University|format=PDF|date= |accessdate=May 4, 2013}}</ref> In an effort to restore the Volga khanates, Crimeans and their [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] allies [[Russo-Crimean Wars|invaded central Russia]] and were even able to [[Fire of Moscow (1571)|burn down parts of Moscow]] in 1571.<ref>{{cite book|author=Solovyov, S.|title=History of Russia from the Earliest Times|publisher=AST|year=2001|volume=6|pages=751–809|isbn=978-5-17-002142-0}}</ref> But in the next year the large invading army was thoroughly defeated by Russians in the [[Battle of Molodi]], forever eliminating the threat of an Ottoman–Crimean expansion into Russia.

In 1612, the Poles were forced to retreat by the Russian volunteer corps, led by two national heroes, merchant [[Kuzma Minin]] and Prince [[Dmitry Pozharsky]]. The [[Romanov Dynasty]] acceded to the throne in 1613 by the decision of Zemsky Sobor, and the country started its gradual recovery from the crisis.

Russia continued its territorial growth through the 17th century, which was the age of [[Cossacks]]. Cossacks were warriors organized into military communities, resembling [[pirates]] and [[pioneers of the New World]]. In 1648, the peasants of Ukraine joined the [[Zaporozhian Cossacks]] in rebellion against Poland-Lithuania during the [[Khmelnytsky Uprising]] in reaction to the social and religious oppression they had been suffering under Polish rule. In 1654, the Ukrainian leader, [[Bohdan Khmelnytsky]], offered to place Ukraine under the protection of the Russian Tsar, [[Aleksey&nbsp;I]]. Aleksey's acceptance of this offer led to another [[Russo-Polish War (1654–1667)|Russo-Polish War]]. Finally, Ukraine was split along the [[Dnieper River]], leaving the western part, [[right-bank Ukraine]], under Polish rule and the eastern part ([[Left-bank Ukraine]] and [[Kiev]]) under Russian rule. Later, in 1670–71, the [[Don Cossacks]] led by [[Stenka Razin]] initiated a major uprising in the [[Volga Region]], but the Tsar's troops were successful in defeating the rebels.

In the east, the rapid Russian exploration and colonisation of the huge territories of Siberia was led mostly by Cossacks hunting for valuable furs and ivory. [[Russian explorers]] pushed eastward primarily along the [[Siberian River Routes]], and by the mid-17th century there were Russian settlements in Eastern Siberia, on the [[Chukchi Peninsula]], along the [[Amur River]], and on the Pacific coast. In 1648, the [[Bering Strait]] between Asia and North America was passed for the first time by [[Fedot Popov]] and [[Semyon Dezhnyov]].

[[Peter the Great's reforms]] brought considerable Western European cultural influences to Russia.

The reign of Peter&nbsp;I's daughter [[Elizabeth of Russia|Elizabeth]] in 1741–62 saw Russia's participation in the [[Seven Years' War]] (1756–63). During this conflict Russia annexed [[East Prussia]] for a while and even took Berlin. However, upon Elisabeth's death, all these conquests were returned to the [[Kingdom of Prussia]] by pro-Prussian [[Peter&nbsp;III of Russia]].

[[Catherine the Great|Catherine&nbsp;II]] ("the Great"), who ruled in 1762–96, presided over the Age of [[Russian Enlightenment]]. She extended Russian political control over the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth and incorporated most of its territories into Russia during the [[Partitions of Poland]], pushing the Russian frontier westward into Central Europe. In the south, after successful [[Russo-Turkish Wars]] against [[Ottoman Turkey]], Catherine advanced Russia's boundary to the Black Sea, defeating the [[Crimean Khanate]]. As a result of victories over [[Qajar dynasty|Qajar Iran]] through the [[Russo-Persian Wars]], by the first half of the 19th century Russia also made significant territorial gains in [[Transcaucasia]] and the [[North Caucasus]], forcing the former to irrevocably cede what is nowadays [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]], [[Dagestan]], [[Azerbaijan]] and [[Armenia]] to Russia.<ref>Timothy C.

In alliances with various European countries, Russia fought against [[Napoleon]]'s France. The [[French invasion of Russia]] at the height of Napoleon's power in 1812 reached Moscow, but eventually failed miserably as the obstinate resistance in combination with the bitterly cold [[Russian winter]] led to a disastrous defeat of invaders, in which more than 95% of the pan-European [[Grande Armée]] perished.<ref>{{cite web|title=Ruling the Empire|publisher=Library of Congress|url=http://countrystudies.us/russia/5.htm|accessdate=December 27, 2007}}</ref> Led by [[Mikhail Kutuzov]] and [[Barclay de Tolly]], the Russian army ousted Napoleon from the country and drove through Europe in the [[war of the Sixth Coalition]], finally entering Paris.

The officers of the [[Napoleonic Wars]] brought ideas of liberalism back to Russia with them and attempted to curtail the tsar's powers during the abortive [[Decembrist revolt]] of 1825. At the end of the conservative reign of [[Nicolas&nbsp;I]] (1825–55), a zenith period of Russia's power and influence in Europe was disrupted by defeat in the [[Crimean War]].

Nicholas's successor [[Alexander II of Russia|Alexander&nbsp;II]] (1855–81) enacted significant changes in the country, including the [[emancipation reform of 1861]]. These ''Great Reforms'' spurred industrialization and modernized the Russian army, which had successfully liberated Bulgaria from Ottoman rule in the [[1877–78 Russo-Turkish War]].

The late 19th century saw the rise of various socialist movements in Russia. Alexander&nbsp;II was killed in 1881 by revolutionary terrorists, and the reign of his son
[[Alexander III of Russia|Alexander&nbsp;III]] (1881–94) was less liberal but more peaceful. The last Russian Emperor, [[Nicholas&nbsp;II]] (1894–1917), was unable to prevent the events of the Russian [[Revolution of 1905]], triggered by the unsuccessful [[Russo-Japanese War]] and the demonstration incident known as [[Bloody Sunday (1905)|Bloody Sunday]]. The uprising was put down, but the government was forced to concede major reforms ([[Russian Constitution of 1906]]), including granting the [[freedom of speech|freedoms of speech]] and [[freedom of assembly|assembly]], the legalization of political parties, and the creation of an elected legislative body, the [[State Duma of the Russian Empire]]. The [[Stolypin reform|Stolypin agrarian reform]] led to a massive peasant migration and settlement into [[Siberia]].

In 1914, Russia entered [[World War&nbsp;I]] in response to Austria-Hungary's declaration of war on Russia's ally Serbia, and fought across multiple fronts while isolated from its [[Triple Entente]] allies. In 1916, the [[Brusilov Offensive]] of the Russian Army almost completely destroyed the military of [[Austria-Hungary]]. However, the already-existing public distrust of the regime was deepened by the rising costs of war, [[World War I casualties|high casualties]], and rumors of corruption and treason. All this formed the climate for the [[Russian Revolution]] of 1917, carried out in two major acts.

The [[February Revolution]] forced [[Nicholas II of Russia|Nicholas II]] to abdicate; he and his family were imprisoned and [[Shooting of the Romanov family|later executed in Yekaterinburg]] during the [[Russian Civil War]]. The monarchy was replaced by a shaky coalition of political parties that declared itself the [[Russian Provisional Government|Provisional Government]].

The rule of the new authorities only aggravated the crisis in the country, instead of resolving it. Eventually, the [[October Revolution]], led by [[Bolshevik]] leader [[Vladimir Lenin]], overthrew the Provisional Government and gave full governing power to the Soviets, leading to the creation of the world's first [[socialist state]].

Following the October Revolution, a [[Russian Civil War|civil war]] broke out between the [[anti-Communist]] [[White movement]] and the new [[Workers' council|Soviet]] regime with its [[Red Army]]. Bolshevist Russia lost its Ukrainian, Polish, Baltic, and Finnish territories by signing the [[Treaty of Brest-Litovsk (Russia–Central Powers)|Treaty of Brest-Litovsk]] that concluded hostilities with the [[Central Powers]] of World War&nbsp;I. The [[Allies of World War I|Allied powers]] launched an unsuccessful [[Allied intervention in the Russian Civil War|military intervention]] in support of anti-Communist forces. In the meantime both the Bolsheviks and White movement carried out campaigns of deportations and executions against each other, known respectively as the [[Red Terror]] and [[White Terror (Russia)|White Terror]]. By the end of the civil war, Russia's economy and infrastructure were heavily damaged. Millions became [[White émigré]]s,<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=uUsLAAAAIAAJ&pg=PA3 Transactions of the American Philosophical Society]. James E.

The [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic]] (called ''Russian Socialist Federative Soviet Republic'' at the time), together with the [[Ukrainian SSR|Ukrainian]], [[Byelorussian SSR|Byelorussian]], and [[Transcaucasian SSR|Transcaucasian Soviet Socialist Republics]], [[Treaty on the Creation of the USSR|formed]] the [[Union of Soviet Socialist Republics]] (USSR), or Soviet Union, on December 30, 1922. Out of the 15 [[republics of the USSR|republics that would make up the USSR]], the largest in size and over half of the total USSR population was the Russian SFSR, which came to dominate the union for its entire 69-year history.

Following [[Vladimir Lenin|Lenin's]] death in 1924, a [[List of leaders of the Soviet Union#List of troikas|troika]] was designated to govern the Soviet Union. However, [[Joseph Stalin]], an elected [[General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|General Secretary of the Communist Party]], managed to suppress all opposition groups within the party and consolidate power in his hands. [[Leon Trotsky]], the main proponent of [[world revolution]], was exiled from the Soviet Union in 1929, and Stalin's idea of [[Socialism in One Country]] became the primary line. The continued internal struggle in the Bolshevik party culminated in the [[Great Purge]], a period of mass repressions in 1937–38, during which hundreds of thousands of people were executed, including [[Old Bolshevik|original party members]] and military leaders accused of [[coup d'état]] plots.<ref>Abbott Gleason (2009).

Under Stalin's leadership, the government launched a [[planned economy]], industrialisation of the largely rural country, and [[Collectivization in the USSR|collectivization]] of its agriculture. During this period of rapid economic and social change, millions of people were sent to [[Gulag|penal labor camps]],<ref name="Getty">Getty, Rittersporn, Zemskov.

Under the doctrine of [[state atheism]] in the Soviet Union, there was a "government-sponsored program of forced conversion to [[Marxist-Leninist atheism|atheism]]" conducted by Communists.<ref>Religion and the State in Russia and China: Suppression, Survival, and Revival, by Christopher Marsh, page 47.

As for the Russian Orthodox Church, Soviet authorities sought to control it and, in times of national crisis, to exploit it for the regime's own purposes; but their ultimate goal was to eliminate it. During the first five years of Soviet power, the Bolsheviks executed 28 Russian Orthodox bishops and over 1,200 Russian Orthodox priests. Many others were imprisoned or exiled. Believers were harassed and persecuted. Most seminaries were closed, and the publication of most religious material was prohibited. By 1941 only 500 churches remained open out of about 54,000 in existence prior to World War I.

====World War II====
[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-W0506-316, Russland, Kampf um Stalingrad, Siegesflagge.jpg|thumb|The [[Battle of Stalingrad]], the largest and bloodiest battle in the history of warfare, ended in 1943 with Soviet victory]]

The [[Appeasement]] policy of Great [[United Kingdom|Britain]] and [[France]] towards [[Adolf Hitler]]'s [[Anschluss|annexation of Austria]] and [[German occupation of Czechoslovakia|Czechoslovakia]] did not stem an increase in the power of [[Nazi Germany]]. Around the same time, the [[Nazi Germany|Third Reich]] allied with the [[Empire of Japan]], a rival of the USSR in the Far East and an open enemy of the USSR in the [[Soviet–Japanese Border Wars]] in 1938–39.

In August 1939, the Soviet government decided to improve relations with Germany by concluding the [[Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact]], pledging [[Non-aggression pact|non-aggression]] between the two countries and dividing Eastern Europe into their respective spheres of influence. While Hitler conquered Poland and France and other countries acted on a single front at the start of [[World War&nbsp;II]], the USSR was able to build up its military and occupy the Western Ukraine, [[Hertza region]] and Northern [[Bukovina]] as a result of the [[Soviet invasion of Poland]], the [[Winter War]], [[Soviet occupation of the Baltic states (1940)|the occupation of the Baltic states]] and [[Soviet occupation of Bessarabia and Northern Bukovina]].

[[File:RIAN archive 601181 In a street of Leningrad after German air raid.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Siege of Leningrad]] during [[World War II]], the deadliest siege of a city in history, ended in 1944 with Soviet victory]]

On June 22, 1941, Nazi Germany broke the non-aggression treaty and invaded the Soviet Union with the largest and most powerful invasion force in human history,<ref>{{cite web |title=World War&nbsp;II|website=Encyclopædia Britannica |accessdate=March 9, 2008 |url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/648813/World-War-II}}</ref> opening the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|largest theater of World War&nbsp;II]].

Another German failure was the [[Siege of Leningrad]], in which the city was fully blockaded on land between 1941 and 1944 by German and Finnish forces, and suffered starvation and more than a million deaths, but never surrendered.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20110629173955/http://www.cambridge.org/gb/knowledge/isbn/item1173696/?site_locale=en_GB The Legacy of the Siege of Leningrad, 1941–1995].

The 1941–45 period of World War&nbsp;II is known in Russia as the "[[Great Patriotic War (term)|Great Patriotic War]]".

[[File:Before being sent to the front.jpg|thumb|Soldiers of the rifle division, before going to the front. November 1941. [[Minin and Pozharsky Square|Soviet Square]]]]
The Soviet rear was also badly damaged by the [[Operation Barbarossa|German invasion]]. [[Luftwaffe]] bombed the cities of the Soviet Union from the air. [[Nizhny Novgorod|Gorky]] suffered the most from the [[Bombing of Gorky in World War II|bombing]]. This city was the main industrial center of the USSR and was located near the [[Moscow Defence Zone]]. The bombing of the [[Volga Military District|Volga]] capital destroyed the largest automobile plant [[GAZ]]. This plant supplied tanks for the front. Whole residential areas and other large factories of the city were destroyed. From 1941 to 1943, German pilots bombed different areas of the city. This bombardment is comparable to the [[The Blitz|London Blitz]]. Some damage remained until this time.

====Cold War====
[[File:Soviet Union - Russian SFSR.svg|thumb|The RSFSR in 1956–1991, mostly after territorial acquisitions according to WWII treaties, the accession of [[Tuvan People's Republic|Tuva]] in 1944, the [[1954 transfer of Crimea|transfer of the Crimean Oblast in 1954]] and the incorporation of the [[Karelo-Finnish SSR]] in 1956. In 1991, the borders of the Russian SFSR became the Russian Federation's international borders with sovereign states]]

After the war, Eastern and Central Europe including [[East Germany]] and part of [[Austria]] was occupied by [[Red Army]] according to the [[Potsdam Conference]]. Dependent socialist governments were installed in the [[Eastern Bloc]] satellite states. Becoming the world's second [[Russia and weapons of mass destruction|nuclear weapons power]], the USSR established the [[Warsaw Pact]] alliance and entered into a struggle for global dominance, known as the [[Cold War]], with the United States and [[NATO]]. The Soviet Union supported revolutionary movements across the world, including the newly formed People's Republic of China, the [[Democratic People's Republic of Korea]] and, later on, the [[Republic of Cuba]]. Significant amounts of Soviet resources were [[International relations within the Comecon|allocated in aid]] to the other socialist states.<ref>[http://rs6.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?frd/cstdy:@field%28DOCID+su0391%29 Foreign trade] from ''A Country Study: Soviet Union (Former)''. [[Library of Congress Country Studies]] project.</ref>

After Stalin's death and a short period of [[Collective leadership|collective rule]], the new leader [[Nikita Khrushchev]] denounced the [[cult of personality]] of Stalin and launched the policy of [[de-Stalinization]]. The penal labor system was reformed and many prisoners were released and rehabilitated (many of them posthumously).<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,916205-2,00.html|work=TIME|accessdate=August 1, 2008|title=Great Escapes from the Gulag|date=June 5, 1978}}</ref> The general easement of repressive policies became known later as the [[Khrushchev Thaw]]. At the same time, tensions with the United States heightened when the two rivals clashed over the deployment of the United States [[PGM-19 Jupiter|Jupiter missiles]] in Turkey and Soviet [[Cuban Missile Crisis|missiles in Cuba]].

[[File:Sputnik asm.jpg|thumb|left|190px|[[Sputnik&nbsp;1]] was the world's first artificial satellite]]

In 1957, the [[Soviet Union]] launched the world's first artificial [[satellite]], ''[[Sputnik&nbsp;1]]'', thus starting the [[Space Age]]. Russia's [[cosmonaut]] [[Yuri Gagarin]] became the first human to orbit the Earth, aboard the ''[[Vostok&nbsp;1]]'' manned spacecraft on [[Cosmonautics Day|April 12, 1961]].

Following the ousting of Khrushchev in 1964, another period of [[Collectivity of leadership|collective rule]] ensued, until [[Leonid Brezhnev]] became the leader. The era of the 1970s and the early 1980s was later designated as the [[Era of Stagnation]], a period when economic growth slowed and social policies became static. The 1965 [[Kosygin reform]] aimed for partial [[decentralization]] of the [[Soviet economy]] and shifted the emphasis from [[heavy industry]] and weapons to [[light industry]] and [[consumer goods]] but was stifled by the conservative Communist leadership.

In 1979, after a Communist-led revolution in Afghanistan, [[Soviet invasion of Afghanistan|Soviet forces entered]] that country. The occupation drained economic resources and dragged on without achieving meaningful political results. Ultimately, the Soviet Army was withdrawn from Afghanistan in 1989 due to international opposition, persistent anti-Soviet guerrilla warfare, and a lack of support by Soviet citizens.

[[File:Boris Yeltsin 19 August 1991-1.jpg|thumb|Russian President [[Boris Yeltsin]] stands on a tank during the [[1991 Soviet coup d'état attempt|August Coup of 1991]], two months after the [[Russian presidential election, 1991|first presidential elections]].

From 1985 onwards, the last Soviet leader [[Mikhail Gorbachev]], who sought to enact liberal reforms in the Soviet system, introduced the policies of ''[[glasnost]]'' (openness) and ''[[perestroika]]'' (restructuring) in an attempt to end the [[Era of Stagnation|period of economic stagnation]] and to democratise the government. This, however, led to the rise of strong nationalist and separatist movements. Prior to 1991, the Soviet economy was the second largest in the world,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.umsl.edu/services/govdocs/wofact90/world12.txt|publisher=[[Central Intelligence Agency]]|accessdate=March 9, 2008|title=1990 CIA World Factbook}}</ref> but during its last years it was afflicted by shortages of goods in grocery stores, huge budget deficits, and explosive growth in the money supply leading to inflation.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.photius.com/countries/russia/economy/russia_economy_unforeseen_results_o~1315.html|title=Russia Unforeseen Results of Reform|publisher=The Library of Congress Country Studies; CIA World Factbook|accessdate=March 10, 2008}}</ref>

By 1991, economic and political turmoil began to boil over, as the Baltic republics chose to secede from the Soviet Union. On March 17, a [[Soviet Union referendum, 1991|referendum]] was held, in which the vast majority of participating citizens voted in favour of changing the Soviet Union into a [[Union of Sovereign States|renewed federation]]. In August 1991, [[1991 Soviet coup d'état attempt|a coup d'état attempt]] by members of Gorbachev's government, directed against Gorbachev and aimed at preserving the Soviet Union, instead led to the end of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. On December 25, 1991, the USSR [[dissolution of the Soviet Union|was dissolved]] into 15 [[post-Soviet states]].

In June 1991, [[Boris Yeltsin]] became the first directly elected President in Russian history when he was elected President of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic, which became the independent Russian Federation in December of that year.

The 1990s were plagued by armed conflicts in the [[North Caucasus]], both local ethnic skirmishes and separatist [[Islamist]] insurrections. From the time [[Chechnya|Chechen]] separatists declared independence in the early 1990s, an [[First Chechen War|intermittent guerrilla war]] has been fought between the rebel groups and the Russian military.

The Russian Federation is fundamentally structured as a [[Multi-party system|multi-party]] [[representative democracy]], with the federal government composed of three branches:
* Legislative: The [[bicameral]] [[Federal Assembly of Russia]], made up of the 450-member [[State Duma]] and the 170-member [[Federation Council]], adopts [[federal law]], [[declaration of war|declares war]], approves treaties, has the [[power of the purse]] and the power of [[impeachment]] of the President.
* Executive: The [[President of Russia|President]] is the [[Supreme Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation|Commander-in-Chief]] of the [[Russian Armed Forces|Armed Forces]], can veto [[legislative bill]]s before they become law, and appoints the [[Government of Russia]] (Cabinet) and other officers, who administer and enforce federal laws and policies.
* [[Judiciary of Russia|Judiciary]]: The [[Constitutional Court of Russia|Constitutional Court]], [[Supreme Court of Russia|Supreme Court]] and lower federal courts, whose judges are appointed by the Federation Council on the recommendation of the President, interpret laws and can overturn laws they deem [[unconstitutional]].

Federal subjects
According to the [[Constitution of Russia|Constitution]], the country comprises eighty-five [[federal subjects of Russia|federal subjects]],<ref>{{cite web|title=The Constitution of the Russian Federation |website=[[:ru:Официальный интернет-портал правовой информации|pravo.gov.ru]] |url=http://pravo.gov.ru:8080/page.aspx?94685 |pages=19, 21 |language=Russian |date=April 11, 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140413142716/http://pravo.gov.ru:8080/page.aspx?94685 |archivedate=April 13, 2014}}</ref> including the disputed [[Republic of Crimea]] and [[federal cities of Russia|federal city]] of [[Sevastopol]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://kremlin.ru/events/president/news/20605|title=Treaty Between the Russian Federation and the Republic of Crimea on Ascension to the Russian Federation of the Republic of Crimea and on Establishment of New Subjects Within the Russian Federation|publisher=Kremlin.ru|date=March 18, 2014|accessdate=April 10, 2014|language=ru}}</ref> In 1993, when the Constitution was adopted, there were eighty-nine federal subjects listed, but later some of them were merged.

Republics are allowed to establish their own official language alongside Russian but are represented by the federal government in international affairs. Republics are meant to be home to specific ethnic minorities.
* 9 [[krais of Russia|krais]] (territories): essentially the same as oblasts. The "territory" designation is historic, originally given to frontier regions and later also to the administrative divisions that comprised autonomous okrugs or autonomous oblasts.
* 4 [[autonomous okrugs of Russia|autonomous okrugs]] (autonomous districts): originally autonomous entities within oblasts and krais created for ethnic minorities, their status was elevated to that of federal subjects in the 1990s. With the exception of [[Chukotka Autonomous Okrug]], all autonomous okrugs are still administratively subordinated to a krai or an oblast of which they are a part.
* 1 [[Autonomous oblasts of Russia|autonomous oblast]] (the [[Jewish Autonomous Oblast]]): historically, autonomous oblasts were administrative units subordinated to krais. In 1990, all of them except for the Jewish AO were elevated in status to that of a republic.
* 3 [[federal cities]] (Moscow, [[Saint Petersburg]], and [[Sevastopol]]): major cities that function as separate regions.

;Federal districts
Federal subjects are grouped into eight [[federal districts of Russia|federal districts]], each administered by an envoy appointed by the President of Russia.<ref>''Russian Classification of Economic Regions'' (OK&nbsp;024–95) of January 1, 1997 as amended by the Amendments #1/1998 through #5/2001. (Section&nbsp;I. Federal Districts)</ref> Unlike the federal subjects, the federal districts are not a subnational level of government, but are a level of administration of the federal government. Federal districts' envoys serve as liaisons between the federal subjects and the federal government and are primarily responsible for overseeing the compliance of the federal subjects with the federal laws.

[[File:Russia Köppen.svg|upright=1.35|thumb|[[Köppen climate classification|Köppen climate types]] of Russia]]
Russia is the [[largest country in the world]]; its total area is {{convert|17075200|km2|sqmi}}.<ref name="General Information">{{cite web|title=General Information|url=http://www.russianembassy.org/page/general-information|publisher=Russian 6Embassy|accessdate=February 14, 2016}}</ref><ref name="area">[http://www.gks.ru/free_doc/doc_2015/region/reg-pok15.pdf Regions of Russia. Social and economic indicators 2015] Russian Federal State Statistics Service</ref> This makes it larger than the continents of [[Oceania]], [[Europe]] and [[Antarctica]].. It lies between latitudes [[41st parallel north|41°]] and [[82nd parallel north|82° N]], and longitudes [[19th meridian east|19° E]] and [[169th meridian west|169° W]].

Russia's territorial expansion was achieved largely in the late 16th century under the Cossack [[Yermak Timofeyevich]] during the reign of [[Ivan the Terrible]], at a time when competing city-states in the western regions of Russia had banded together to form one country. Yermak mustered an army and pushed eastward where he conquered nearly all the lands once belonging to the [[Mongol Empire|Mongols]], defeating their ruler, [[Kuchum|Khan Kuchum]].<ref>Alton S Donnelly, ''The Russian Conquest of Bashkiria'', 1968, pages 23 and 127; Lincoln, W. Bruce. ''The Conquest of a Continent: Siberia and the Russians''. New York: Random House, 1994, p. 30</ref>

Russia has a wide natural resource base, including major deposits of timber, petroleum, natural gas, coal, ores and other mineral resources.

=== Topography ===
The two most widely separated points in Russia are about {{convert|8000|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} apart along a [[geodesic]] line. These points are: a {{convert|60|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} long [[Vistula Spit]] the boundary with Poland separating the [[Gdańsk Bay]] from the [[Vistula Lagoon]] and the most southeastern point of the [[Kuril Islands]]. The points which are farthest separated in [[longitude]] are {{convert|6600|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} apart along a geodesic line. These points are: in the west, the same spit on the boundary with Poland, and in the east, the [[Big Diomede Island]]. The Russian Federation spans 11 [[time zone]]s.

Most of Russia consists of vast stretches of plains that are predominantly [[steppe]] to the south and heavily forested to the north, with [[tundra]] along the northern coast. Russia possesses 10% of the world's [[arable land]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Oil prices drive the cost of food|publisher=RIA Novosti|url=http://sputniknews.com/analysis/20080222/99853566.html|accessdate=February 22, 2008}}</ref> Mountain ranges are found along the southern borders, such as the [[Caucasus Mountains|Caucasus]] (containing [[Mount Elbrus]], which at {{convert|5642|m|0|abbr=on}} is the highest point in both Russia and Europe) and the [[Altai Mountains|Altai]] (containing [[Mount Belukha]], which at the {{convert|4506|m|0|abbr=on}} is the highest point of Siberia outside of the [[Russian Far East]]); and in the eastern parts, such as the [[Verkhoyansk Range]] or the volcanoes of [[Kamchatka Peninsula]] (containing [[Klyuchevskaya Sopka]], which at the {{convert|4750|m|0|abbr=on}} is the highest [[active volcano]] in Eurasia as well as the highest point of [[Asian Russia]]). The [[Ural Mountains]], rich in mineral resources, form a north-south range that divides Europe and Asia.

Russia has an extensive coastline of over {{convert|37000|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} along the Arctic and Pacific Oceans, as well as along the [[Baltic Sea]], [[Sea of Azov]], [[Black Sea]] and [[Caspian Sea]].<ref name=cia>{{cite web|last=The World Factbook|title=CIA|publisher=Central Intelligence Agency|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/rs.html|accessdate=December 26, 2007}}</ref> The [[Barents Sea]], [[White Sea]], [[Kara Sea]], [[Laptev Sea]], [[East Siberian Sea]], [[Chukchi Sea]], [[Bering Sea]], [[Sea of Okhotsk]], and the [[Sea of Japan]] are linked to Russia via the Arctic and Pacific.

=== Climate ===
{{Main|Climate of Russia}}
The enormous size of Russia and the remoteness of many areas from the sea result in the dominance of the [[humid continental climate]], which is prevalent in all parts of the country except for the tundra and the extreme southwest. Mountains in the south obstruct the flow of warm air masses from the Indian Ocean, while the plain of the west and north makes the country open to Arctic and Atlantic influences.<ref name=congress>{{cite web|title=Climate|publisher=Library of Congress|url=http://countrystudies.us/russia/24.htm|accessdate=December 26, 2007}}</ref>

Most of Northern European Russia and Siberia has a [[subarctic climate]], with extremely severe winters in the inner regions of Northeast Siberia (mostly the [[Sakha Republic]], where the Northern [[Pole of Cold]] is located with the record low temperature of {{convert|−71.2|°C|°F|1|disp=or}}), and more moderate winters elsewhere. Both the strip of land along the shore of the Arctic Ocean and the [[Russian Arctic islands]] have a [[polar climate]].

The coastal part of [[Krasnodar Krai]] on the Black Sea, most notably in [[Sochi]], possesses a [[humid subtropical climate]] with mild and wet winters. In many regions of East Siberia and the Far East, winter is dry compared to summer; other parts of the country experience more even precipitation across seasons. Winter precipitation in most parts of the country usually falls as snow. The region along the Lower Volga and Caspian Sea coast, as well as some areas of southernmost Siberia, possesses a [[semi-arid climate]].

The Russian central bank announced plans in 2013 to free float the Russian ruble in 2015. According to a stress test conducted by the central bank Russian financial system would be able to handle a currency decline of 25%–30% without major central bank interference. However, the Russian economy began stagnating in late 2013 and in combination with the [[War in Donbass]] is in danger of entering stagflation, slow growth and high inflation. The recent decline in the Russian ruble has increased the costs for Russian companies to make interest payments on debt issued in U.S. dollar or other foreign currencies that have strengthened against the ruble; thus it costs Russian companies more of their ruble-denominated revenue to repay their debt holders in dollars or other foreign currencies.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2014/11/10/russia-rouble-debt-idUSL6N0T02OR20141110|title=Falling rouble creates debt payment headache for Russian companies|author=Sujata Rao|date=10 November 2014|newspaper=Reuters|accessdate=16 December 2014}}</ref> {{as of|2016|March}}, the ruble was devalued more than 50 percent since July 2014.<ref name="Nasdaq Mar2016">{{cite web|url=http://www.nasdaq.com/article/bank-of-russia-keeps-rates-on-hold-20160318-00172|title=Today's Stock Market News and Analysis from Nasdaq.com|website=NASDAQ.com}}</ref> Moreover, after bringing inflation down to 3.6% in 2012, the lowest rate since gaining independence from the Soviet Union, inflation in Russia jumped to nearly 7.5% in 2014, causing the central bank to increase its lending rate to 8% from 5.5% in 2013.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424052702304419104579326441407494108|title=Russia Ready to Float Ruble Next Year Regardless of Rate|last=Ostroukh|first=Andrey|date=January 17, 2014|publisher=Wall Street Journal|access-date=March 11, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170320184446/https://www.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424052702304419104579326441407494108|archive-date=March 20, 2017|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/russian-central-bank-raises-key-interest-rate-to-8-from-7-5-1406284743|title=Russian Central Bank Raises Key Interest Rate to 8% From 7.5%|last=Razumovskaya|first=Olga|date=July 25, 2014|publisher=Wall Street Journal}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/USDRUB:CUR|title=USD/RUB exchange rate|publisher=Bloomberg L.P.}}</ref> In an October 2014 article in ''Bloomberg Business Week'', it was reported that Russia had significantly started shifting its economy towards China in response to increasing financial tensions following its annexation of Crimea and subsequent Western economic sanctions.<ref>"China Embraces Russia", Bloomberg Business Week, October 9, 2014, pp. 15–16.</ref>

Much of Russia's inland waterways, which [[List of countries by waterways length|total {{convert|102000|km|0|abbr=on}}]], are made up of natural rivers or lakes. In the European part of the country the network of channels connects the basins of major rivers.

<!--tag for image of Mikhail Lomonosov is located at end of previous section, raising image to relieve clutter below-->
Science and technology in Russia blossomed since the [[Age of Enlightenment]], when [[Peter the Great]] founded the [[Russian Academy of Sciences]] and [[Saint Petersburg State University]], and [[polymath]] [[Mikhail Lomonosov]] established the [[Moscow State University]], paving the way for a strong native tradition in learning and innovation. In the 19th and 20th centuries the country produced a large number of notable scientists and inventors.

The [[Russian physics school]] began with Lomonosov who proposed the law of conservation of matter preceding the [[energy conservation law]]. Russian discoveries and inventions in physics include the [[electric arc]], electrodynamical [[Lenz's law]], [[space groups]] of [[crystal]]s, [[photoelectric cell]], [[superfluidity]], [[Cherenkov radiation]], [[electron paramagnetic resonance]], [[heterotransistor]]s and [[3D holography]]. [[Laser]]s and [[maser]]s were co-invented by [[Nikolai Basov]] and [[Alexander Prokhorov]], while the idea of [[tokamak]] for controlled [[nuclear fusion]] was introduced by [[Igor Tamm]], [[Andrei Sakharov]] and [[Lev Artsimovich]], leading eventually the modern international [[ITER]] project, where Russia is a party.

Since the time of [[Nikolay Lobachevsky]] (the "[[Copernicus]] of [[Geometry]]" who pioneered the [[non-Euclidean geometry]]) and a prominent tutor [[Pafnuty Chebyshev]], the [[Russian mathematical school]] became one of the most influential in the world.<ref>{{cite book|title=Russian Mathematicians in the 20th Century|year=2003|publisher=Princeton University Press|location=Princeton, NJ|isbn=978-981-02-4390-6|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Russian_Mathematicians_in_the_20th_Centu.html?id=BFsnWXkqZaMC|editor=Yakov Sinai}}</ref> Chebyshev's students included [[Aleksandr Lyapunov]], who founded the modern [[stability theory]], and [[Andrey Markov]] who invented the [[Markov chain]]s. In the 20th century Soviet mathematicians, such as [[Andrey Kolmogorov]], [[Israel Gelfand]], and [[Sergey Sobolev]], made major contributions to various areas of mathematics. Nine Soviet/Russian mathematicians were awarded with the [[Fields Medal]], a most prestigious award in mathematics. Recently [[Grigori Perelman]] was offered the first ever Clay [[Millennium Prize Problems]] Award for his final proof of the [[Poincaré conjecture]] in 2002.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.claymath.org/poincare/index.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130428112451/http://www.claymath.org/poincare/index.html|archivedate=April 28, 2013 |title=The Poincaré Conjecture |publisher=Claymath.org |date= |accessdate=May 4, 2013}}</ref>

[[Russian chemist]] [[Dmitry Mendeleev]] invented the [[Periodic table]], the main framework of modern [[chemistry]]. [[Aleksandr Butlerov]] was one of the creators of the theory of [[chemical structure]], playing a central role in [[organic chemistry]]. [[Russian biologists]] include [[Dmitry Ivanovsky]] who discovered viruses, [[Ivan Pavlov]] who was the first to experiment with the [[classical conditioning]], and [[Ilya Mechnikov]] who was a pioneer researcher of the [[immune system]] and [[probiotics]].

Many Russian scientists and inventors were [[émigrés]], like [[Igor Sikorsky]], who built the first [[airliner]]s and modern-type helicopters; [[Vladimir Zworykin]], often called the father of TV; chemist [[Ilya Prigogine]], noted for his work on [[dissipative structures]] and [[complex systems]]; Nobel Prize-winning economists [[Simon Kuznets]] and [[Wassily Leontief]]; physicist [[Georgiy Gamov]] (an author of the [[Big Bang]] theory) and social scientist [[Pitirim Sorokin]]. Many foreigners worked in Russia for a long time, like [[Leonard Euler]] and [[Alfred Nobel]].

[[Russian inventions]] include [[arc welding]] by [[Nikolay Benardos]], further developed by [[Nikolay Slavyanov]], [[Konstantin Khrenov]] and other Russian engineers. [[Gleb Kotelnikov]] invented the [[knapsack parachute]], while [[Evgeniy Chertovsky]] introduced the [[pressure suit]]. [[Alexander Lodygin]] and [[Pavel Yablochkov]] were pioneers of [[electric lighting]], and [[Mikhail Dolivo-Dobrovolsky]] introduced the first [[three-phase electric power]] systems, widely used today. [[Sergei Vasiljevich Lebedev|Sergei Lebedev]] invented the first commercially viable and mass-produced type of [[synthetic rubber]]. The first [[ternary computer]], ''[[Setun]]'', was developed by [[Nikolay Brusentsov]].

In the 20th century a number of prominent [[Soviet aerospace engineers]], inspired by the fundamental works of [[Nikolay Yegorovich Zhukovsky|Nikolai Zhukovsky]], [[Sergei Chaplygin]] and others, designed many hundreds of models of military and civilian aircraft and founded a number of ''KBs'' (''Construction Bureaus'') that now constitute the bulk of Russian [[United Aircraft Corporation]]. Famous Russian aircraft include the civilian [[Tupolev|Tu]]-series, [[Sukhoi|Su]] and [[MiG]] fighter aircraft, [[Kamov|Ka]] and [[Mil Moscow Helicopter Plant|Mi]]-series helicopters; many Russian aircraft models are on the [[list of most produced aircraft]] in history.

Famous Russian battle tanks include [[T-34|T34]], the most heavily produced tank design of World War&nbsp;II,<ref>[http://www.achtungpanzer.com/panzerkampfwagen-t-34r-soviet-t-34-in-german-service.htm Panzerkampfwagen T-34(r)] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110222215401/http://www.achtungpanzer.com/panzerkampfwagen-t-34r-soviet-t-34-in-german-service.htm |date=February 22, 2011 }} by George Parada (n.d.)

With all these achievements, however, since the late Soviet era Russia was lagging behind the West in a number of technologies, mostly those related to [[energy conservation]] and [[consumer goods]] production. The crisis of the 1990s led to the drastic reduction of the state support for science and a [[brain drain]] migration from Russia.

In the 2000s, on the wave of a new economic boom, the situation in the Russian science and technology has improved, and the government [[Medvedev modernisation programme|launched a campaign]] aimed into modernisation and [[innovation]]. Russian President Dmitry Medvedev formulated top priorities for the country's technological development:
* [[Efficient energy use]]
* Information technology, including both common products and the products combined with [[space technology]]
* [[Nuclear power|Nuclear energy]]
* [[Pharmaceuticals]]<ref>[http://sputniknews.com/russia/20091011/156428675.html Medvedev outlines priorities for Russian economy's modernization] RIA Novosti</ref>

Currently Russia has completed the [[GLONASS]] [[satellite navigation system]]. The country is developing its own [[Sukhoi PAK FA|fifth-generation jet fighter]] and constructing the first serial [[mobile nuclear plant]] in the world.

=== Space exploration ===
Russian achievements in the field of [[space technology]] and [[space exploration]] are traced back to [[Konstantin Tsiolkovsky]], the father of theoretical [[astronautics]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aiaa.org/index.cfm|title=American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics|publisher=Aiaa.org|accessdate=January 2, 2010}}{{cbignore}}</ref> His works had inspired leading Soviet rocket engineers, such as [[Sergey Korolyov]], [[Valentin Glushko]], and many others who contributed to the success of the [[Soviet space program]] in the early stages of the [[Space Race]] and beyond.

In 1957 the first Earth-orbiting artificial [[satellite]], ''[[Sputnik&nbsp;1]]'', was launched; in 1961 the first human trip into space was successfully made by [[Yuri Gagarin]]. Many other Soviet and Russian [[space exploration records]] ensued, including the first [[spacewalk]] performed by [[Alexey Leonov]], [[Luna&nbsp;9]] was the first spacecraft to land on the [[Moon]], [[Venera&nbsp;7]] was the first to land on another planet ([[Venus]]), [[Mars&nbsp;3]] then the first to land on [[Mars]], the first [[space exploration rover]] ''[[Lunokhod-1|Lunokhod 1]]'', and the first [[space station]] ''[[Salyut&nbsp;1]]'' and ''[[Mir]]''.

After the [[collapse of the Soviet Union]], some government-funded space exploration programs, including the [[Buran programme|Buran]] space shuttle program, were cancelled or delayed, while participation of the Russian space industry in commercial activities and international cooperation intensified.
Nowadays Russia is the largest satellite launcher.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.russianspaceweb.com/2009.html |title=Russian space program in 2009: plans and reality |publisher=Russianspaceweb.com |accessdate=April 27, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100128201450/http://www.russianspaceweb.com/2009.html |archivedate=January 28, 2010}}</ref> After the United States [[Space Shuttle]] program ended in 2011, [[Soyuz (rocket family)|Soyuz rockets]] became the only provider of transport for astronauts at the [[International Space Station]]. 

[[Luna-Glob]] is a Russian Moon exploration programme, with first planned mission launch in 2021. Roscosmos is also developing the ''[[Federation (spacecraft)|Federation]]'' spacecraft, to replace the aging Soyuz, it could also take potential crewed mission to lunar orbit as early as 2025.<ref>{{cite news |title=Russia may select first crew for its Federation spacecraft next year |url=http://www.spaceflightinsider.com/organizations/roscosmos/russia-may-select-first-crew-federation-spacecraft-next-year/ |work=www.spaceflightinsider.com}}</ref>

=== Water supply and sanitation ===
{{Main|Water supply and sanitation in Russia}}
In Russia, approximately 70 per cent of drinking water comes from surface water and 30 per cent from groundwater. In 2004, water supply systems had a total capacity of 90 million cubic metres a day. The average residential water use was 248 litres per capita per day.<ref name="UN">United Nations:[https://www.un.org/esa/agenda21/natlinfo/countr/russia/RussiaSanitation04f.pdf Sanitation Country Profile Russian Federation], 2004</ref> One fourth of the world's fresh surface and [[groundwater]] is located in Russia. The water utilities sector is one of the largest industries in Russia serving the entire Russian population.

Russians have practised [[Orthodox Christianity]] since the 10th century. According to the historical traditions of the Orthodox Church, [[Christianity]] was first brought to the territory of modern [[Belarus]], Russia and [[Ukraine]] by [[Saint Andrew]], the first [[Apostle (Christian)|Apostle]] of [[Jesus Christ]].<ref name=encarta>{{cite encyclopedia|last=Microsoft Encarta Online Encyclopedia 2007 |title=Russia |url=http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761569000_6/Russia.html |accessdate=December 27, 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080109010927/https://encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761569000_6/Russia.html |archivedate=January 9, 2008}}</ref> Following the ''Primary Chronicle'', the definitive [[Christianization]] of [[Kievan Rus']] dates from the year 988 (the year is disputed<ref>Oleg Rapov, ''Russkaya tserkov v IX–pervoy treti XII veka'' (''The Russian Church from the 9th to the First 3rd of the 12th Century''). Moscow, 1988.</ref>), when [[Vladimir the Great]] was baptized in [[Chersonesus]] and proceeded to baptize his family and people in [[Kiev]]. The latter events are traditionally referred to as the "baptism of Rus'" ({{lang-ru|Крещение Руси}}, {{lang-ua|Хрещення Русі}}) in Russian and Ukrainian literature. Much of the Russian population, like other Slavic peoples, preserved for centuries a double belief (''dvoeverie'') in both indigenous religion and Orthodox Christianity.

At the time of the [[Russian revolution|1917 Revolution]], the [[Russian Orthodox Church]] was deeply integrated into the [[autocracy|autocratic state]], enjoying official status. This was a significant factor that contributed to the Bolshevik attitude to religion and the steps they took to control it. Bolsheviks consisted of many people with non-Russian, Communist Russians and influential Jewish backgrounds such as [[Vladimir Lenin]], [[Leon Trotsky]], [[Grigory Zinoviev]], [[Lev Kamenev]], [[Grigori Sokolnikov]] who were indifferent towards Christianity and based on the writings of German philosopher [[Karl Marx]] with [[Marxism–Leninism]] as an ideology went on to form the [[Communist party]].<ref name =PoU>{{Citation |publisher = Studia Historica 48 |isbn = 978-951-710-008-3 |location = Helsinki |title = The Party of Unbelief |url = https://openlibrary.org/books/OL25433417M/The_Party_of_Unbelief |author = [[Arto Luukkanen]] |publication-date = 1994 |oclc = 832629341 |id =|year = 1994 }}</ref>

State atheism in the Soviet Union was known in Russian as ''gosateizm'',<ref name=Kowalewski /> and was based on the ideology of [[Marxism–Leninism]]. [[Marxist–Leninist atheism|Marxist–Leninist Atheism]] has consistently advocated the control, suppression, and elimination of religion. Within about a year of the revolution, the state [[expropriated]] all church property, including the churches themselves, and in the period from 1922 to 1926, 28 Russian Orthodox [[bishop]]s and more than 1,200 [[priest]]s were killed.

Currently, there is no official census of religion in Russia, and estimates are based on surveys only. In 2012 the research organization Sreda published Arena Atlas, a detailed enumeration of religious populations and nationalities in Russia, based on a large-sample country-wide survey. They found that 46.8% of Russians declared themselves Christians (including 41% Russian Orthodox, 1.5% simply Orthodox or members of non-Russian Orthodox churches, 4.1% unaffiliated Christians, and less than 1% for both Catholic and Protestant), while 25% were [[spiritual but not religious]], 13% were atheists, 6.5% were [[Muslims]], 1.2% were followers of "traditional religions honoring gods and ancestors" (including Rodnovery, [[Tengrism]] and other [[ethnic religions]]), and 0.5% were [[Tibetan Buddhism|Tibetan Buddhists]].

Traced back to the [[Christianization of Kievan Rus']] in the 10th century, Russian Orthodoxy is the dominant religion in the country; smaller Christian denominations such as Catholics, [[Armenian Gregorians]] and various Protestant churches also exist. The Russian Orthodox Church was the country's state religion prior to the Revolution and remains the largest religious body in the country. An estimated 95% of the registered Orthodox parishes belong to the Russian Orthodox Church while there are a number of smaller Orthodox churches.<ref name="religare.ru">{{cite web |script-title=ru:Сведения о религиозных организациях, зарегистрированных в Российской Федерации по данным Федеральной регистрационной службы|trans-title=Data about religious organizations registered in Russian Federation according to Federal Migration Service records|url=http://www.religare.ru/2_36302.html|language=Russian |date=December 19, 2006|accessdate=December 27, 2007}}</ref> However, the vast majority of Orthodox believers do not attend church on a regular basis. Easter is the most popular religious holiday in Russia, celebrated by a large segment of the Russian population, including large numbers of those who are non-religious. More than three-quarters of the Russian population celebrate Easter by making traditional Easter cakes, coloured eggs and [[paskha (dish)|paskha]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.interfax-religion.com/?act=news&div=8400|title=Over 90 percent of Russians are going to celebrate Easter anyway – poll|publisher=Interfax Religion|date=April 22, 2011|accessdate=November 2, 2011}}</ref>

In cultural and social affairs Vladimir Putin has collaborated closely with the Russian Orthodox Church. [[Patriarch Kirill of Moscow]], head of the Church, endorsed his election in 2012.

On April 26, 2017, for the first time, The [[U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom]] classified Russia as one of the world's worst violators of religious liberty, recommending in its 2017 annual report that the U.S. government deem Russia a "country of particular concern" under the International Religious Freedom Act and negotiate for religious liberty. The report states, "—it is the sole state to have not only continually intensified its repression of religious freedom since USCIRF commenced monitoring it, but also to have expanded its repressive policies....ranging from administrative harassment to arbitrary imprisonment to extrajudicial killing, are implemented in a fashion that is systematic, ongoing, and egregious."<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.uscirf.gov/sites/default/files/Russia.2017.pdf|title=Russia Tier1 USCIRF recommended countries of particular concern (CPC)|date=April 26, 2017}}</ref> On April 4, 2017 [[UN Special Rapporteur]] on Freedom of Opinion and Expression [[David Kaye (law professor)|David Kaye]], UN Special Rapporteur on Freedoms of Peaceful Assembly and Association [[Maina Kiai]], and UN Special Rapporteur on Freedom of Religion and Belief [[Ahmed Shaheed]] condemned Russia's treatment of [[Jehovah's Witnesses]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.forum18.org/archive.php?article_id=2274|title= RUSSIA:Jehovah's Witnesses banned, property confiscated}}</ref> Many other countries and international organizations have spoken out on Russia's religious abuses.<ref>{{Cite web|url= http://www2.stetson.edu/~psteeves/relnews/170421c.html|title=Russia Religion News}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.hrw.org/news/2017/04/20/russia-court-bans-jehovahs-witnesses|title=Russia: Court Bans Jehovah's Witnesses|date=2017-04-20}}</ref>

The oldest and largest [[Russian universities]] are [[Moscow State University]] and [[Saint Petersburg State University]]. In the 2000s, in order to create higher education and research institutions of comparable scale in Russian regions, the government launched a program of establishing "federal universities", mostly by merging existing large regional universities and research institutes and providing them with a special funding. These new institutions include the [[Southern Federal University]], [[Siberian Federal University]], [[Kazan Volga Federal University]], [[North-Eastern Federal University]], and [[Far Eastern Federal University]].

There are over 160 different ethnic groups and indigenous peoples in Russia.<ref name=ethnicgroups /> The country's vast cultural diversity spans ethnic [[Russians]] with their [[Slavs|Slavic]] [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox]] traditions, [[Tatars]] and [[Bashkirs]] with their Turkic Muslim culture, [[Buddhist]] [[nomad]]ic [[Buryats]] and [[Kalmyks]], [[Shamanistic]] peoples of the [[Extreme North]] and Siberia, highlanders of the [[Northern Caucasus]], and [[Finno-Ugric peoples]] of the [[Russian North West]] and [[Volga Region]].

[[Handicraft]], like [[Dymkovo toy]], [[khokhloma]], [[gzhel]] and [[palekh miniature]] represent an important aspect of Russian [[folk culture]]. Ethnic Russian clothes include [[kaftan]], [[kosovorotka]] and [[ushanka]] for men, [[sarafan]] and [[kokoshnik]] for women, with [[lapti]] and [[valenki]] as common shoes. The clothes of [[Cossack]]s from Southern Russia include [[Burka (Caucasus)|burka]] and [[papaha]], which they share with the peoples of the Northern Caucasus.

[[Russian cuisine]] widely uses fish, caviar, poultry, mushrooms, berries, and honey. Crops of [[rye]], wheat, [[barley]], and [[millet]] provide the ingredients for various breads, [[pancake]]s and cereals, as well as for [[kvass]], beer and vodka drinks. [[Black bread]] is rather popular in Russia, compared to the rest of the world. Flavourful soups and stews include [[shchi]], [[borsch]], [[ukha]], [[solyanka]] and [[okroshka]]. [[Smetana (dairy product)|Smetana]] (a heavy [[sour cream]]) is often added to soups and salads. [[Pirozhki]], [[blini]] and [[syrniki]] are native types of pancakes. [[Chicken Kiev]], [[pelmeni]] and [[shashlyk]] are popular meat dishes, the last two being of Tatar and Caucasus origin respectively. Other meat dishes include stuffed cabbage rolls ''([[golubtsy]])'' usually filled with meat.<ref name="mrig-golubtsy">{{cite web|url=http://www.moscow-russia-insiders-guide.com/how-to-cook-golubtzy.html |title=How to Cook Golubtzy |publisher=Moscow-russia-insiders-guide.com |date=August 6, 2011 |accessdate=May 4, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130501190658/http://www.moscow-russia-insiders-guide.com/how-to-cook-golubtzy.html |archivedate=May 1, 2013}}</ref> Salads include [[Olivier salad]], [[vinegret]] and [[dressed herring]].

Russia's large number of ethnic groups have distinctive traditions regarding [[Music of Russia#Ethnic roots music|folk music]]. Typical ethnic Russian musical instruments are [[gusli]], [[balalaika]], [[zhaleika]], and [[garmoshka]]. Folk music had a significant influence on Russian classical composers, and in modern times it is a source of inspiration for a number of popular [[folk band]]s, like [[Melnitsa]]. [[Russian folk songs]], as well as patriotic [[Soviet songs]], constitute the bulk of the repertoire of the world-renowned [[Alexandrov Ensemble|Red Army choir]] and other popular ensembles.

Russians have [[Russian traditions|many traditions]], including the washing in [[banya (sauna)|banya]], a hot steam bath somewhat similar to [[sauna]].<ref name="banya" /> Old [[Russian folklore]] takes its roots in the pagan [[Slavic mythology|Slavic religion]]. Many [[Russian fairy tale]]s and epic [[bylina]]s were adapted for animation films, or for feature movies by the prominent directors like [[Aleksandr Ptushko]] (''[[Ilya Muromets (film)|Ilya Muromets]]'', ''[[Sadko (film)|Sadko]]'') and [[Aleksandr Rou]] (''[[Morozko]]'', ''[[Vasilisa the Beautiful (1939 film)|Vasilisa the Beautiful]]''). Russian poets, including [[Pyotr Pavlovich Yershov|Pyotr Yershov]] and [[Leonid Filatov]], made a number of well-known poetical interpretations of the classical fairy tales, and in some cases, like that of [[Alexander Pushkin]], also created fully original fairy tale poems of great popularity.

=== Architecture ===
{{Main|Russian architecture|List of Russian architects}}
[[File:Saint Basil Cathedral, Moscow.jpg|thumb|left|180px|[[Saint Basil's Cathedral]] in [[Red Square]], [[Moscow]], one of the most popular symbols of the country]]

Since the [[Christianization of Kievan Rus']] for several ages Russian architecture was influenced predominantly by the [[Byzantine architecture]]. Apart from fortifications ([[kremlin]]s), the main stone buildings of ancient Rus' were [[Orthodox church (building)|Orthodox churches]] with their many [[dome]]s, often gilded or brightly painted.

[[Aristotle Fioravanti]] and other Italian architects brought [[Renaissance]] trends into Russia since the late 15th century, while the 16th century saw the development of unique [[tent-like church]]es culminating in [[Saint Basil's Cathedral]].<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20130116214934/http://www.rusarch.ru/zagraevsky19.htm The first stone tented roof church and the origins of the tented roof architecture] by [[Sergey Zagraevsky]] at RusArch.ru {{ru icon}}</ref> By that time the [[onion dome]] design was also fully developed.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20130116215900/http://www.rusarch.ru/zagraevsky1.htm The shapes of domes of ancient Russian churches] by [[Sergey Zagraevsky]] at the site of RusArch.ru {{ru icon}}</ref> In the 17th century, the "fiery style" of ornamentation flourished in Moscow and [[Yaroslavl]], gradually paving the way for the [[Naryshkin baroque]] of the 1690s. After the [[reforms of Peter the Great]] the change of architectural styles in Russia generally followed that in the Western Europe.

The 18th-century taste for [[rococo]] architecture led to the ornate works of [[Bartolomeo Rastrelli]] and his followers. The reigns of [[Catherine the Great]] and her grandson [[Alexander I of Russia|Alexander&nbsp;I]] saw the flourishing of [[Neoclassical architecture]], most notably in the capital city of [[Saint Petersburg]]. The second half of the 19th century was dominated by the [[Neo-Byzantine architecture in the Russian Empire|Neo-Byzantine]] and [[Russian Revival]] styles. Prevalent styles of the 20th century were the [[Art Nouveau]], [[Constructivist architecture|Constructivism]], and the [[Stalin Empire style]].

[[File:Saint Isaac's Cathedral in SPB.jpeg|thumb|right|The neoclassical [[Saint Isaac's Cathedral]] in [[Saint Petersburg]]]]

[[Russian cultural heritage register#Denial of heritage (1917–1941)|With the change in values imposed by communist ideology]], the tradition of preservation was broken. Independent preservation societies, even those that defended only secular landmarks such as Moscow-based OIRU were disbanded by the end of the 1920s. A new anti-religious campaign, launched in 1929, coincided with collectivization of peasants; destruction of churches in the cities peaked around 1932. A number of churches were demolished, including the [[Cathedral of Christ the Saviour]] in Moscow. [[Russian cultural heritage register#Post-Soviet Russia (1991–present)|In Moscow alone losses of 1917–2006]] are estimated at over 640 notable buildings (including 150 to 200 listed buildings, out of a total inventory of 3,500) – some disappeared completely, others were replaced with concrete replicas.

In 1955, a new Soviet leader, [[Nikita Khrushchev]], condemned the "excesses" of the former academic architecture,<ref>Russian: Постановление ЦК КПСС и СМ СССР "Об устранении излишеств в проектировании и строительстве", November 4, 1955 (Khrushchev's decree ''On liquidation of excesses&nbsp;...'') {{ru icon}}</ref> and the late Soviet era was dominated by plain [[functionalism in architecture]]. This helped somewhat to resolve the housing problem, but created a large quantity of buildings of low architectural quality, much in contrast with the previous bright styles. [[Russian cultural heritage register#Khrushchev's offensive (1959–1964)|In 1959 Nikita Khrushchev launched his anti-religious campaign]]. By 1964 over 10 thousand churches out of 20 thousand were shut down (mostly in rural areas) and many were demolished. Of 58 monasteries and convents operating in 1959, only sixteen remained by 1964; of Moscow's fifty churches operating in 1959, thirty were closed and six demolished.

[[File:Rublev Arhangel Mikhail.jpg|thumb|150px|left|''Archangel Michael'' fresco (1408) by [[Andrei Rublev]], which represents the typical [[Russo-Byzantine]] style of art.]]
Early Russian painting is represented in [[Russian icons|icons]] and vibrant [[fresco]]s, the two genres inherited from [[Byzantium]]. As Moscow rose to power, [[Theophanes the Greek]], [[Dionisius]] and [[Andrei Rublev]] became vital names associated with a distinctly Russian art.

The [[Russian Academy of Arts]] was created in 1757<ref>[http://en.rah.ru/content/en/section-academy-en.html Russian Academy of Arts] official site.</ref> and gave Russian artists an international role and status. [[Ivan Argunov]], [[Dmitry Levitzky]], [[Vladimir Borovikovsky]] and other 18th-century academicians mostly focused on [[portrait painting]]. In the early 19th century, when [[neoclassicism]] and [[romantism]] flourished, mythological and Biblical themes inspired many prominent paintings, notably by [[Karl Briullov]] and [[Alexander Andreyevich Ivanov|Alexander Ivanov]].

In the mid-19th century the ''[[Peredvizhniki]]'' (''Wanderers'') group of artists broke with the Academy and initiated a school of art liberated from academic restrictions.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Gray|first=Camilla|title=Russian Experiment in Art|publisher=Thames and Hudson|location=London|year=2002|page=9}}</ref> These were mostly [[Realism (visual arts)|realist]] painters who captured Russian identity in landscapes of wide rivers, forests, and birch clearings, as well as vigorous genre scenes and robust portraits of their contemporaries. Some artists focused on depicting dramatic moments in Russian history, while others turned to [[social criticism]], showing the conditions of the poor and caricaturing authority; [[Critical realism (philosophy of the social sciences)|critical realism]] flourished under the reign of [[Alexander II of Russia|Alexander II]]. Leading realists include [[Ivan Shishkin]], [[Arkhip Kuindzhi]], [[Ivan Kramskoi]], [[Vasily Polenov]], [[Isaac Levitan]], [[Vasily Surikov]], [[Viktor Vasnetsov]], [[Ilya Repin]], and [[Boris Kustodiev]].

The turn of the 20th century saw the rise of [[symbolism (art)|symbolist]] painting, represented by [[Mikhail Vrubel]], [[Kuzma Petrov-Vodkin]], and [[Nicholas Roerich]].

The [[Russian avant-garde]] was a large, influential wave of [[modernist art]] that flourished in Russia from approximately 1890 to 1930. The term covers many separate, but inextricably related art movements that occurred at the time, namely [[neo-primitivism]], [[suprematism]], [[constructivism (art)|constructivism]], [[rayonism]], and [[Russian Futurism]]. Notable artists from this era include [[El Lissitzky]], [[Kazimir Malevich]], [[Wassily Kandinsky]], and [[Marc Chagall]]. Since the 1930s the revolutionary ideas of the [[avant-garde]] clashed with the newly emerged conservative direction of [[socialist realism]].

Soviet art produced works that were furiously patriotic and [[anti-fascist]] during and after the [[Great Patriotic War]]. Multiple war memorials, marked by a great restrained solemnity, were built throughout the country. Soviet artists often combined innovation with socialist realism, notably the sculptors [[Vera Mukhina]], [[Yevgeny Vuchetich]] and [[Ernst Neizvestny]].

Music in 19th-century Russia was defined by the tension between classical composer [[Mikhail Glinka]] along with other members of [[The Mighty Handful]], who embraced Russian national identity and added religious and folk elements to their compositions, and the [[Russian Musical Society]] led by composers [[Anton Rubinstein|Anton]] and [[Nikolay Rubinstein]]s, which was musically conservative.

[[File:L.N.Tolstoy Prokudin-Gorsky.jpg|thumb|right|upright|[[Leo Tolstoy]] is regarded as one of the greatest authors of all time]]

In the 18th century, during the era of [[Russian Enlightenment]], the development of [[Russian literature]] was boosted by the works of [[Mikhail Lomonosov]] and [[Denis Fonvizin]]. By the early 19th century a modern national tradition had emerged, producing some of the greatest writers in Russian history. This period, known also as the [[Golden Age of Russian Poetry]], began with [[Alexander Pushkin]], who is considered the founder of the modern Russian literary language and often described as the "Russian Shakespeare".<ref>{{Cite book|author=Kelly, C|title=Russian Literature: A Very Short Introduction (Paperback)|publisher=Oxford Paperbacks|isbn=978-0-19-280144-9|year=2001}}</ref> It continued with the poetry of [[Mikhail Lermontov]] and [[Nikolay Nekrasov]], dramas of [[Alexander Ostrovsky]] and [[Anton Chekhov]], and the prose of [[Nikolai Gogol]] and [[Ivan Turgenev]]. [[Leo Tolstoy]] and [[Fyodor Dostoyevsky]] have been described by literary critics as the greatest novelists of all time.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/513793/Russian-literature|publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica|accessdate=April 11, 2008|title=Russian literature; Leo Tolstoy}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|work=Time Magazine |url=http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,943893,00.html|accessdate=April 10, 2008|title=Freaking-Out with Fyodor|author=Otto Friedrich|date=September 6, 1971}}</ref>

[[File:Vasily Perov - Портрет Ф.М.Достоевского - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Fyodor Dostoevsky]]]]

By the 1880s, the age of the great novelists was over, and short fiction and poetry became the dominant genres. The next several decades became known as the [[Silver Age of Russian Poetry]], when the previously dominant [[literary realism]] was replaced by [[Symbolism (arts)|symbolism]]. Leading authors of this era include such poets as [[Valery Bryusov]], [[Vyacheslav Ivanov (poet)|Vyacheslav Ivanov]], [[Alexander Blok]], [[Nikolay Gumilev]] and [[Anna Akhmatova]], and novelists [[Leonid Andreyev]], [[Ivan Bunin]], and [[Maxim Gorky]].

[[Russian philosophy]] blossomed in the 19th century, when it was defined initially by the opposition of [[Westernizers]], who advocated Western political and economical models, and [[Slavophiles]], who insisted on developing Russia as a unique civilization. The latter group includes [[Nikolai Danilevsky]] and [[Konstantin Leontiev]], the founders of [[eurasianism]]. In its further development Russian philosophy was always marked by a deep connection to literature and interest in creativity, society, politics and nationalism; [[Russian cosmism]] and religious philosophy were other major areas. Notable philosophers of the late 19th and the early 20th centuries include [[Vladimir Solovyov (philosopher)|Vladimir Solovyev]], [[Sergei Bulgakov]], and [[Vladimir Vernadsky]].

[[File:AleksandrPushkin.jpg|thumb|right|upright|[[Alexander Pushkin]] (portrait by [[Vasily Tropinin]])]]

Following the [[Russian Revolution]] of 1917 many prominent writers and philosophers left the country, including Bunin, [[Vladimir Nabokov]] and [[Nikolay Berdyayev]], while a new generation of talented authors joined together in an effort to create a distinctive [[working-class culture]] appropriate for the new Soviet state. In the 1930s censorship over literature was tightened in line with the policy of [[socialist realism]]. In the late 1950s restrictions on literature were eased, and by the 1970s and 1980s, writers were increasingly ignoring official guidelines. Leading authors of the Soviet era include novelists [[Yevgeny Zamyatin]] (emigrated), [[Ilf and Petrov]], [[Mikhail Bulgakov]] (censored) and [[Mikhail Sholokhov]], and poets [[Vladimir Mayakovsky]], [[Yevgeny Yevtushenko]], and [[Andrey Voznesensky]].

The Soviet Union was also a major producer of science fiction, written by authors like [[Arkady and Boris Strugatsky]], [[Kir Bulychov]], [[Alexander Belayev]] and [[Ivan Yefremov]].<ref>{{Cite book|author=McGuire, Patrick L.|title=Red stars: political aspects of Soviet science fiction.

Russian and later [[Soviet cinema]] was a hotbed of invention in the period immediately following 1917, resulting in world-renowned films such as ''[[The Battleship Potemkin]]'' by [[Sergei Eisenstein]].<ref name=film>{{cite web|title=Russia:Motion pictures|publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica|year=2007|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/513251/Russia|accessdate=December 27, 2007}}</ref> Eisenstein was a student of filmmaker and theorist [[Lev Kuleshov]], who developed the [[Soviet montage theory]] of film editing at the world's first film school, the [[All-Union Institute of Cinematography]]. [[Dziga Vertov]], whose ''kino-glaz'' ("film-eye") theory—that the camera, like the human eye, is best used to explore real life—had a huge impact on the development of documentary film making and cinema realism. The subsequent state policy of socialist realism somewhat limited creativity; however, many Soviet films in this style were artistically successful, including ''[[Chapaev (film)|Chapaev]]'', ''[[The Cranes Are Flying]]'', and ''[[Ballad of a Soldier]]''.<ref name=film />

The 1960s and 1970s saw a greater variety of artistic styles in Soviet cinema.

[[Russian animation]] dates back to late [[Russian Empire]] times. During the Soviet era, [[Soyuzmultfilm]] studio was the largest animation producer. Soviet animators developed a great variety of pioneering techniques and aesthetic styles, with prominent directors including [[Ivan Ivanov-Vano]], [[Fyodor Khitruk]] and [[Aleksandr Tatarsky]]. Many Soviet cartoon heroes such as the Russian-style [[Winnie-the-Pooh]], cute little [[Cheburashka]], Wolf and Hare from ''[[Nu, Pogodi!]]'', are iconic images in Russia and many surrounding countries.

The late 1980s and 1990s were a period of crisis in Russian cinema and animation. Although Russian filmmakers became free to express themselves, state subsidies were drastically reduced, resulting in fewer films produced. The early years of the 21st century have brought increased viewership and subsequent prosperity to the industry on the back of the economic revival. Production levels are already higher than in Britain and Germany.<ref>{{cite web|author=Dzieciolowski, Z|title=Kinoeye: Russia's reviving film industry|url=https://www.opendemocracy.net/globalization-Film/russian_film_3726.jsp|accessdate=December 27, 2007}}</ref> Russia's total box-office revenue in 2007 was $565&nbsp;million, up 37% from the previous year.<ref>{{cite web|title=Russian Entertainment & Media Industry worth $27.9 bn by 2011|publisher=joomag magazine|url=http://www.joomag.com/magazine/Russia/4228/p44|accessdate=October 3, 2010}}</ref> In 2002 the ''[[Russian Ark]]'' became the first feature film ever to be shot in a single take. The traditions of Soviet animation were developed recently by such directors as [[Aleksandr Petrov (animator)|Aleksandr Petrov]] and studios like [[Melnitsa Animation]].

While there were few stations or channels in the Soviet time, in the past two decades many new state and privately owned [[Russian language radio stations|radio stations]] and [[TV in Russia|TV channels]] have appeared. In 2005 a state-run English language [[Russia Today TV]] started broadcasting, and its Arabic version [[Rusiya Al-Yaum]] was launched in 2007. Censorship and [[Media freedom in Russia]] has always been a main theme of Russian media.

[[Association football]] is one of the most popular sports in modern Russia. The Soviet national team became the first European Champions by winning [[Euro 1960]]. Appearing in four [[FIFA World Cup]]s from 1958 to 1970, [[Lev Yashin]] is regarded as one of the greatest goalkeepers in the history of football, and was chosen on the [[FIFA World Cup Dream Team]].<ref name="FIFA">[https://www.fifa.com/classicfootball/players/player=174638/ "Yashin, the impregnable Spider"].

Since the end of the Soviet era, tennis has grown in popularity and Russia has produced a number of famous players, including [[Maria Sharapova]]. In martial arts, Russia produced the sport [[Sambo (martial art)|Sambo]] and renowned fighters, like [[Fedor Emelianenko]]. [[Chess]] is a widely popular pastime in Russia; from 1927, Russian grandmasters have held the [[world chess championship]] almost continuously.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.chessgames.com/wcc.html|title=Chessgames guide to the World Championship|publisher=Chessgames.com|accessdate=October 29, 2010}}</ref>

Formula One is also becoming increasingly popular in Russia. In 2010 [[Vitaly Petrov]] of [[Vyborg]] became the first Russian to drive in Formula One, and was soon followed by a second – [[Daniil Kvyat]], from [[Ufa]] – in 2014. There had only been two Russian Grands Prix (in 1913 and 1914), but the [[Russian Grand Prix]] returned as part of the [[Formula One]] season in [[2014 Formula One season|2014]], as part of a six-year deal.<ref>{{cite web|title=Russia secures 2014 grand prix deal|url=http://en.espn.co.uk/f1/motorsport/story/31127.html|publisher=ESPN|accessdate=October 24, 2011}}</ref>

=== National holidays and symbols ===
{{Main|Public holidays in Russia|Cultural icons of Russia}}
[[File:Alyye parusa.jpg|thumb|left|[[Scarlet Sails (tradition)|Scarlet Sails]] celebration on the [[Neva]] river in [[Saint Petersburg]]]]
There are seven [[public holidays in Russia]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sras.org/russian_holidays|title=Official days off for public holidays in Russia|publisher=Sras.org|accessdate=October 29, 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101130020221/http://sras.org/russian_holidays#|archive-date=November 30, 2010|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}</ref> except those always celebrated on Sunday. Russian New Year traditions resemble those of the Western Christmas, with [[New Year Tree]]s and gifts, and [[Ded Moroz]] ([[Father Frost]]) playing the same role as [[Santa Claus]]. [[Orthodox Christmas]] falls on January 7, because the [[Russian Orthodox Church]] still follows the [[Julian calendar]], and all Orthodox holidays are 13 days after Western ones. Two other major Christian holidays are Easter and [[Trinity Sunday]]. [[Kurban Bayram]] and [[Uraza Bayram]] are celebrated by Russian Muslims.

Further Russian public holidays include [[Defender of the Fatherland Day]] (February 23), which honors Russian men, especially those serving in the army; [[International Women's Day]] (March 8), which combines the traditions of [[Mother's Day]] and [[Valentine's Day]]; [[Spring and Labor Day]] (May 1); [[Victory Day (May 9)|Victory Day]] (May 9); [[Russia Day]] (June 12); and [[Unity Day (Russia)|Unity Day]] (November 4), commemorating the popular uprising which expelled the Polish occupation force from Moscow in 1612.

[[Victory Day (May 9)|Victory Day]] is the second most popular holiday in Russia; it commemorates the victory over [[Nazi Germany]] and its allies in the [[Great Patriotic War]]. A huge [[military parade]], hosted by the [[President of Russia]], is annually organised in Moscow on [[Red Square]]. Similar parades take place in all major Russian cities and cities with the status ''[[Hero city]]'' or ''City of Military Glory''.

Popular non-public holidays include [[Old New Year]] (the New Year according to the Julian Calendar on January 14), [[Tatiana Day]] (students holiday on January 25), [[Maslenitsa]] (a pre-Christian spring holiday a week before the [[Great Lent]]), [[Cosmonautics Day]] (in tribute to the first human trip into space), [[Ivan Kupala Day]] (another pre-Christian holiday on July 7) and [[Peter and Fevronia Day]] (which takes place on July 8 and is the Russian analogue of Valentine's Day, focusing, however, on family love and fidelity).

[[File:Russian Dolls (4891096981).jpg|thumb|[[Matryoshka doll]] taken apart]]
State symbols of Russia include the [[Byzantine]] [[double-headed eagle]], combined with [[St. George of Moscow]] in the [[Russian coat of arms]]. The [[Russian flag]] dates from the late [[Tsardom of Russia]] period and has been widely used since the time of the [[Russian Empire]]. The [[Russian anthem]] shares its music with the [[Soviet Anthem]], though not the lyrics. The imperial [[motto]] ''God is with us'' and the Soviet motto ''Proletarians of all countries, unite!'' are now obsolete and no new motto has replaced them. The [[hammer and sickle]] and the full [[Soviet coat of arms]] are still widely seen in Russian cities as a part of old architectural decorations. The Soviet [[Red Star]]s are also encountered, often on military equipment and war memorials. The [[Red Banner]] continues to be honored, especially the [[Banner of Victory]] of 1945.

The [[Matryoshka doll]] is a recognizable symbol of Russia, and the towers of [[Moscow Kremlin]] and [[Saint Basil's Cathedral]] in Moscow are Russia's main architectural icons. [[Cheburashka]] is a mascot of the [[Russian national Olympic team]]. [[St. Mary]], [[St. Nicholas]], [[St. Andrew]], [[St. George]], [[St. Alexander Nevsky]], [[St. Sergius of Radonezh]] and [[St. Seraphim of Sarov]] are Russia's [[patron saint]]s. [[Chamomile]] is the [[national flower]], while [[birch]] is the [[national tree]]. The [[Russian bear]] is an animal symbol and a [[national personification]] of Russia, though this image has a Western origin and Russians themselves have accepted it only fairly recently. The native Russian national personification is [[Mother Russia]].

Tourism in Russia has seen rapid growth since the late Soviet period, first domestic tourism and then international tourism, fueled by the rich cultural heritage and great natural variety of the country. Major tourist routes in Russia include a journey around the [[Golden Ring]] of ancient cities, cruises on the big rivers like the [[Volga]], and long journeys on the famous [[Trans-Siberian Railway]]. In 2013, Russia was visited by 28.4 million [[tourist]]s; it is the ninth most visited country in the world and the seventh most visited in Europe.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.e-unwto.org/content/r13521/fulltext.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150112082549/http://www.e-unwto.org/content/r13521/fulltext.pdf|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2015-01-12|title=Tourism Highlights 2014|publisher=UNWTO (World Tourism Organization)|format=PDF|date=2014|accessdate=January 20, 2015}}</ref> The number of Western visitors dropped in 2014.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://rbth.com/business/2014/07/03/concern_in_russia_as_foreign_tourist_numbers_slump_37899.html|title=Concern in Russia as foreign tourist numbers slump|first=Viktor|last=Kuzmin|date=July 3, 2014|publisher=}}</ref>

[[File:Mamaev kurgan (ОКН).JPG|thumb|''[[The Motherland Calls]]'' in [[Volgograd]] is the tallest statue of a woman in the world (not including pedestals)]]
The most visited destinations in Russia are Moscow and Saint Petersburg, the current and former capitals of the country. Recognized as [[World Cities]], they feature such world-renowned museums as the [[Tretyakov Gallery]] and the [[Hermitage Museum|Hermitage]], famous theaters like [[Bolshoi Theater|Bolshoi]] and [[Mariinsky Theater|Mariinsky]], ornate churches like Saint Basil's Cathedral, [[Cathedral of Christ the Saviour]], [[Saint Isaac's Cathedral]] and [[Church of the Savior on Blood]], impressive fortifications like the [[Moscow Kremlin|Kremlin]] and [[Peter and Paul Fortress]], beautiful squares and streets like [[Red Square]], [[Palace Square]], [[Tverskaya Street]], [[Nevsky Prospect]], and [[Arbat Street]]. Rich palaces and parks are found in the former imperial residences in suburbs of [[Moscow]] ([[Kolomenskoye]], [[Tsaritsyno Park|Tsaritsyno]]) and St Petersburg ([[Peterhof Palace|Peterhof]], [[Strelna]], [[Oranienbaum, Russia|Oranienbaum]], [[Gatchina Palace|Gatchina]], [[Pavlovsk Palace|Pavlovsk]] and [[Tsarskoye Selo]]). Moscow displays [[Stalinist architecture|Soviet architecture]] at its best, along with [[Moscow International Business Center|modern skyscrapers]], while St Petersburg, nicknamed ''Venice of the North'', boasts of its classical architecture, many rivers, canals and [[Bridges in Saint Petersburg|bridges]].

[[Kazan]], the capital of [[Tatarstan]], shows a mix of Christian Russian and Muslim Tatar cultures. The city has registered a brand ''The Third Capital of Russia'', though a number of other major cities compete for this status, including [[Novosibirsk]], [[Yekaterinburg]] and [[Nizhny Novgorod]].

The warm subtropical Black Sea coast of Russia is the site for a number of popular sea resorts, like [[Sochi]], the follow-up host of the [[2014 Winter Olympics]]. The mountains of the [[Northern Caucasus]] contain popular ski resorts such as [[Dombay, Russia|Dombay]]. The most famous natural destination in Russia is [[Lake Baikal]], ''the Blue Eye of Siberia''. This unique lake, the oldest and deepest in the world, has crystal-clear waters and is surrounded by [[taiga]]-covered mountains. Other popular natural destinations include [[Kamchatka]] with its volcanoes and geysers, [[Karelia]] with its lakes and [[granite]] rocks, the snowy [[Altai Mountains]], and the wild steppes of [[Tuva]].
