==History==
{{see also|Timeline of Norwich}}

===Roman===
The capital of the [[Iceni]] tribe was a settlement located near to the village of [[Caistor St. Edmund]] on the [[River Tas]] approximately {{convert|8|km|mi|0}} to the south of modern-day Norwich.{{sfn|Morley|2006}} Following an uprising led by [[Boudica]] around AD&nbsp;60 the Caistor area became the [[Roman Britain|Roman]] capital of [[East Anglia]] named ''[[Venta Icenorum]]'', literally "the marketplace of the Iceni".{{sfn|Morley|2006}} The Roman settlement fell into disuse around 450 and the [[Anglo-Saxons]] settled on the site of the modern city between the 5th and 7th centuries,{{sfn|Adams|2005|p=11}} founding the towns of ''Northwic'' (from which Norwich gets its name),{{sfn|Stenton|1970}} ''Westwic'' (at [[Norwich Over the Water|Norwich-over-the-Water]]) and the secondary settlement at Thorpe. According to a local rhyme, the demise of ''Venta Icenorum'' led to the development of Norwich: "Caistor was a city when Norwich was none, Norwich was built of Caistor stone."{{sfn|Morley|2006}}

===Early English and Norman conquest===
[[File:Norwich Cathedral, spire and south transept.jpg|thumb|[[Norwich Cathedral]] is one of the great Norman buildings of England.]]

There are two suggested models of development for Norwich. It is possible that three separate early Anglo-Saxon settlements, one on the north of the river and two either side on the south, joined together as they grew or that one Anglo-Saxon settlement, on the north of the river, emerged in the mid-7th century after the abandonment of the previous three. The ancient city was a thriving centre for trade and commerce in [[East Anglia]] in 1004 when it was raided and burnt by [[Sweyn I of Denmark|Swein Forkbeard]] the [[Viking]] king of Denmark. [[Mercia]]n coins and shards of pottery from the [[Rhineland]] dating from the 8th century suggest that long-distance trade was happening long before this. Between 924 and 939, Norwich became fully established as a town, with its own mint. The word ''Norvic'' appears on coins across Europe minted during this period, in the reign of [[Athelstan|King Athelstan]]. The Vikings were a strong cultural influence in Norwich for 40 to 50 years at the end of the 9th century, setting up an [[Anglo-Scandinavian]] district near the north end of present day King Street. At the time of the [[Norman Conquest]] the city was one of the largest in England. The [[Domesday Book]] states that it had approximately 25 churches and a population of between 5,000 and 10,000. It also records the site of an Anglo-Saxon church in Tombland, the site of the Saxon market place and the later [[Norwich Cathedral|Norman cathedral]]. Norwich continued to be a major centre for trade, the [[River Wensum]] being a convenient export route to the [[River Yare]] and [[Great Yarmouth]], which served as the [[Port of Norwich|port for Norwich]]. [[Quern stone]]s and other artefacts from Scandinavia and the Rhineland have been found during excavations in Norwich city centre. These date from the 11th century onwards.

[[File:Norwich Castle.jpg|thumb|[[Norwich Castle]]'s 12th-century keep]]

[[Norwich Castle]] was founded soon after the Norman Conquest.<ref>{{PastScape|mnumber=132268 |mname=Norwich Castle |accessdate=29 December 2010}}</ref> The [[Domesday Book]] records that 98 Saxon homes were demolished to make way for the castle.{{sfn|Harfield|1991|pp=373, 384}} The [[Normans]] established a new focus of settlement around the Castle and the area to the west of it: this became known as the "New" or "French" borough, centred on the Normans' own market place which survives to the present day as Norwich Market. In 1096, [[Herbert de Losinga]], Bishop of Thetford, began construction of [[Norwich Cathedral]]. The chief building material for the Cathedral was limestone, imported from Caen in Normandy. To transport the building stone to the site, a canal was cut from the river (from the site of present-day Pulls Ferry), all the way up to the east wall. Herbert de Losinga then moved his [[Episcopal see|See]] there to what became the cathedral church for the [[Anglican Diocese of Norwich|Diocese of Norwich]]. The Bishop of Norwich still signs himself ''Norvic''. Norwich received a [[royal charter]] from [[Henry II of England|Henry II]] in 1158, and another one from [[Richard I of England|Richard ''the Lionheart'']] in 1194. Following a riot in the city in 1274, Norwich has the distinction of being the only complete English city to be excommunicated by the Pope.{{sfn|Miller|1806}}

===Middle Ages===
The first recorded presence of [[Jews]] in Norwich is 1134.<ref name="heritagecity1">{{cite web |url=http://www.heritagecity.org/research-centre/churches-and-creeds/jews-in-norwich.htm |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130806235625/http://www.heritagecity.org/research-centre/churches-and-creeds/jews-in-norwich.htm |dead-url=yes |archive-date=6 August 2013 |title=Jews in Norwich |publisher=Heritagecity.org |accessdate=13 September 2013 }}</ref> In 1144, the Jews of Norwich were accused of [[ritual murder]] after a boy ([[William of Norwich]]) was found dead with stab wounds.<ref name="heritagecity1"/> William acquired the status of martyr and was subsequently [[canonization|canonised]]. Pilgrims made offerings to a shrine at the Cathedral (largely finished by 1140) up to the 16th century, but the records suggest there were few of them.{{sfn|Nilson|2001|p=157}} In 1174, Norwich was sacked by the Flemings. In February 1190, all the Jews of Norwich were massacred except for a few who found refuge in the castle. At the site of a medieval well, the bones of 17 individuals, including 11 children, were found in 2004 by workers preparing the ground for construction of a Norwich shopping centre. The remains were determined by [[forensic science|forensic scientists]] to be most probably the remains of such murdered Jews, and a [[Genetic genealogy|DNA]] expert determined that the victims were all related, so that they most probably came from one [[Ashkenazi Jews|Ashkenazi Jewish]] family.{{sfn|Jewish Telegraphic Agency|2011}} The study of these remains was featured in an episode of the [[BBC Television|BBC television]] documentary series ''[[History Cold Case]]''.<ref>{{Cite episode |title=The Bodies in the Well |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b0125kbf |series=History Cold Case |network=[[BBC HD]] |airdate=28 June 2011 |seriesno=2 |number=3 }}</ref>

[[File:Ethelbert Gate from Tombland, Norwich, UK.jpg|thumb|St Ethelbert's Gate at Tombland was built as penance for riots which occurred in the 1270s.]]
In 1216, the castle fell to Louis, Dauphin of France and Hildebrand's Hospital was founded, followed ten years later by the [[Franciscan]] Friary and [[Dominican Order|Dominican]] Friary. The Great Hospital dates from 1249 and the College of St Mary in the Field from 1250. In 1256, Whitefriars was founded. In 1266 the city was sacked by the "Disinherited". It has the distinction of being the only English city ever to be excommunicated, following a riot between citizens and monks in 1274.{{sfn|Miller|1806}} As a penance, St Ethelbert's Gate, one of the entrances to the cathedral priory, was constructed by Norwich citizens. In 1278 the Cathedral received final consecration. In 1290 the city flooded. Austin Friary was founded in that year.

The engine of trade was [[wool]] from Norfolk's [[sheepwalk]]s. Wool made England rich, and the [[staple right|staple port]] of Norwich "in her state doth stand With towns of high'st regard the fourth of all the land", as [[Michael Drayton]] noted in ''[[Poly-Olbion]]'' (1612). The wealth generated by the [[wool#History|wool trade]] throughout the [[Middle Ages]] financed the construction of many fine churches, so that Norwich still has more medieval churches than any other city in Western Europe north of the [[Alps]]. Throughout this period Norwich established wide-ranging trading links with other parts of Europe, its markets stretching from [[Scandinavia]] to Spain and the city housing a [[Hanseatic League|Hanseatic]] warehouse. To organise and control its exports to the [[Low Countries]], [[Great Yarmouth]], as the port for Norwich, was designated one of the staple ports under the terms of the 1353 [[Statute of the Staple]].

From 1280 to 1340 the [[defensive wall|city walls]] were built. At around {{convert|4|km|1|abbr=in}}, these walls, along with the river, enclosed a larger area than that of the [[City of London]]. However, when the city walls were constructed it was made illegal to build outside them, inhibiting expansion of the city. Around this time, the city was made a [[county corporate]] and became the seat of one of the most densely populated and prosperous [[ancient counties of England|counties]] of England. Part of these walls remain standing today.

===Early modern period (1485–1640)===
Hand-in-hand with the wool industry, this key religious centre experienced a Reformation significantly different to other parts of England. The magistracy in Tudor Norwich unusually found ways of managing religious discord whilst maintaining civic harmony.{{sfn|McClendon|1999}}

[[File:John Crome 002.jpg|thumb|''Mousehold Heath, Norwich'' by Norfolk-based artist [[John Crome]]]]
The year 1549 saw an unprecedented rebellion in Norfolk. Unlike popular challenges elsewhere in the Tudor period, it appears to have been [[Protestant]] in nature. For several weeks [[Kett's Rebellion|Kett's rebels]] camped outside Norwich on [[Mousehold Heath]] and took control of the city, with the support of many of its poorer inhabitants. Unusually in England, it divided the city and appears to have linked Protestantism with the plight of the urban poor. In the case of Norwich this process was underscored later by the arrival of [[Dutch people|Dutch]] and [[Flemish people|Flemish]] "[[Elizabethan Strangers|Strangers]]" fleeing persecution from the [[Catholic]]<nowiki/>s and eventually numbering as many as one third of the city's population.{{sfn|Houlbroke|McClendon|2004|p=257}} Large numbers of such exiles came to the city, especially Flemish Protestants  from the Westkwartier ("Western Quarter"), the region in the [[Southern Netherlands]] where the first [[Calvinist]] fires of the [[Dutch Revolt]] had spread. Inhabitants of [[Ypres]] in particular chose Norwich above other destinations.{{sfn|Fagel|2003|p=52}} Perhaps in response to Kett, Norwich became the first provincial city to initiate compulsory payments for a civic scheme of poor relief, which it has been claimed led to its wider introduction, forming the basis of the later Elizabethan Poor Law of 1597–98.{{sfn|Pound|2004|pp=50–56}}

Norwich has traditionally been the home of various minorities, notably French [[Huguenot]] and Belgian [[Walloons|Walloon]] communities in the 16th and 17th centuries. The great "Stranger" immigration of 1567 brought a substantial Flemish and Walloon community of Protestant [[weaver (occupation)|weaver]]s to Norwich, where they are said to have been made welcome.{{sfn|Ketton-Cremer|1957}} The merchant's house which was their earliest base in the city — now a museum — is still known as [[Strangers' Hall]]. It seems that the Strangers were integrated into the local community without much animosity, at least among the business fraternity, who had the most to gain from their skills. Their arrival in Norwich boosted trade with mainland Europe and fostered a movement toward religious reform and radical politics in the city.

The [[Domestic Canary|Norwich Canary]] was first introduced into England by Flemings fleeing from Spanish persecution in the 16th century. They brought with them not only advanced techniques in textile working but also pet canaries, which they began to breed locally, the little yellow bird eventually becoming, in the 20th century, a mascot of the city and the emblem of its football club, [[Norwich City F.C.]], who are nicknamed The Canaries.

Printing was introduced to the city in 1567 by Anthony de Solempne, one of the "Strangers", but it did not take root and had died out by about 1572.{{sfn|Stoker|1981}}

===Civil Wars to Victorian era===
Across the Eastern Counties [[Oliver Cromwell]]'s powerful [[Eastern Association]] was eventually dominant. However, to begin with, there had been a large element of Royalist sympathy within Norwich, which seems to have experienced a continuity of its two-sided political tradition throughout the period. Bishop [[Matthew Wren]] was a forceful supporter of [[Charles I of England|Charles I]]. Nonetheless, [[Roundhead|Parliamentary]] recruitment took hold. The strong Royalist party was stifled by a lack of commitment from the aldermen and isolation from Royalist-held regions.{{sfn|Hopper|2004}} Serious inter-factional disturbances culminated in "The Great Blow" of 1648, when Parliamentary forces tried to quell a Royalist riot. The latter's gunpowder was set off by accident in the city centre, causing mayhem. (According to {{harvnb|Hopper|2004}}, the explosion "ranks among the largest of the century".) Stoutly defended though East Anglia was by the Parliamentary army, there are said to have been pubs in Norwich where the king's health was still drunk and the name of the Protector sung to ribald verse.

At the cost of some discomfort to the Mayor, the moderate [[Joseph Hall (bishop)|Joseph Hall]] was targeted because of his position as Bishop of Norwich.

Norwich was marked in the period after the [[Restoration (England)|Restoration]] of 1660 and the ensuing century by a  golden age of its cloth industry, comparable only to those in the [[West Country]] and Yorkshire.{{sfn|Wilson|2004a}} But unlike other cloth-manufacturing regions, Norwich weaving brought greater urbanisation, substantially concentrated in the surrounds of the city itself, creating an urban society, with features such as leisure time, alehouses, and other public forums of debate and argument.{{sfn|Wilson|2004b}}

[[File:Original Norfolk and Norwich Hospital - geograph.org.uk - 84361.jpg|thumb|Founded in 1771, the [[Norfolk and Norwich Hospital]] cared for the city's poor and sick. It closed in 2003 after services were moved to the [[Norfolk and Norwich University Hospital]].]]
Writing of the early 18th century, Pound describes the city's rich cultural life, the winter theatre season, the festivities accompanying the summer assizes, and other popular entertainments. Norwich was the wealthiest town in England, with a sophisticated system of [[poor relief]], and a large influx of foreign refugees.{{sfn|Pound|2004|p=61}} Despite severe outbreaks of plague, the city had a population of almost 30,000. This made Norwich unique in England, although there were some 50 cities of similar size in Europe. In some, like Lyon or [[Dresden]], this was, as in the case of Norwich, linked to an important proto-industry, such as textiles or china pottery, in some, such as Vienna, Madrid or Dublin, to the city's status as an administrative capital, and in others such as Antwerp, Marseilles or Cologne to a position on an important maritime or river trade route.{{efn|1=For table of city sizes see {{harvtxt|Corfield|2004|p=143}}}}

Norwich in the late 17th century was riven politically. Churchman [[Humphrey Prideaux]] described "two factions, [[Whig (British political party)|Whig]] and [[Tory]] &hellip; and both contend for their way with the utmost violence."{{sfn|Knights|2004}} Nor did the city accept the outcome of the 1688 [[Glorious Revolution]] with a unified voice. The pre-eminent citizen, Bishop William Lloyd, would not take the oaths of allegiance to the new monarchs. One report has it that in 1704 the landlord of Fowler's alehouse "with a glass of beer in hand, went down on his knees and drank a health to James the third, wishing the Crowne [sic] well and settled on his head."{{sfn|Knights|2004|pp=168–174|quote= "Never was a city in the miserable kingdom so wretchedly divided as this," said the ''London Post''}}

In 1716, at a play at the ''New Inn'', the Pretender was cheered and the audience booed and hissed every time King George's name was mentioned. In 1722 supporters of the king were said to be "hiss'd at and curst as they go in the streets," and in 1731 "a Tory mobb, in a great body, went through several parts of this city, in a riotous manner, cursing and abusing such as they knew to be friends of the government."{{efn|1=Reports quoted by {{harvnb|Knights|2004|pp=168–174}}}} But the Whigs gradually gained control and by the 1720s they had successfully petitioned Parliament to allow all adult males working in the textile industry to take up the freedom, on the correct assumption that they would vote Whig. But it had the effect of boosting the city's popular Jacobitism, says Knights, and contests of the kind described continued in Norwich well into a period in which political stability had been discerned at a national level. The city's Jacobitism perhaps only ended with 1745, well after it had ceased to be a significant movement outside Scotland.{{sfn|Knights|2004|pp=168–174}} Despite the Highlanders reaching Derby and Norwich citizens mustering themselves into an association to protect the city, some Tories refused to join in and the vestry of [[St Peter Mancroft]] resolved that it would not ring its bells to summon the defence. Still, it was the end of the road for Norwich Jacobites, and the Whigs organised a notable celebration after the [[Battle of Culloden]].{{sfn|Knights|2004|pp=168–174}}

What the events of this period illustrate is that Norwich had had a strong tradition of popular protest favouring Church and Stuarts and attached to the street and alehouse. Knights tells how in 1716 the mayoral election had ended in a riot, with both sides throwing "brick-ends and great paving stones" at each other.{{sfn|Knights|2004|pp=168–174}} A renowned Jacobite watering-hole, the ''Blue Bell Inn'' (nowadays ''The Bell Hotel''), owned in the early 18th century by the high-church Helwys family, became the central rendezvous of the Norwich Revolution Society in the 1790s.{{sfn|Jewson|1975|p=38}}

Britain's first provincial newspaper, the ''[[Norwich Post]]'', appeared in 1701. By 1726 there were rival Whig and Tory presses and even in mid-century, three-quarters of the males in some parishes were literate.{{efn|1=Quoted by {{harvnb|Knights|2004|pp=181–182}}}} The Norwich municipal library claims an excellent collection of these newspapers, also a folio collection of scrapbooks on 18th-century Norwich politics, which Knights says are "valuable and important". Norwich alehouses had 281 clubs and societies meeting in them in 1701, and at least 138 more were formed before 1758. The [[Theatre Royal, Norwich|Theatre Royal]] opened in 1758, alongside the city's stage productions in inns and puppet shows in rowdy alehouses.{{sfn|Chandler|1998}}{{sfn|Blackwell|Blackwell|2007|loc=Chap 2}} In 1750 Norwich could boast nine booksellers and after 1780 a "growing number of circulating and subscription libraries".{{sfn|Dain|2004}} {{harvnb|Knights|2004}} says: "[All this] made for a lively political culture, in which independence from governmental lines was particularly strong, evident in campaigns against the war with America and for reform... in which trade and the impact of war with [[Revolutionary France]] were key ingredients. The open and contestable structure of local government, the press, the clubs and societies, and dissent all ensured that politics overlapped with communities bound by economics, religion, ideology and print in a world in which public opinion could not be ignored."{{sfn|Knights|2004|pp=168–174}}

[[File:OctagonChapel.JPG|thumb|left|The Octagon Chapel]]
Amid this metropolitan culture the city burghers had built a sophisticated political structure. Freemen, who had the right to trade and to vote at elections, numbered about 2,000 in 1690, rising to over 3,300 by the mid-1730s. With growth partly the result of political manipulation, their numbers did at one point reach one-third of the adult male population.{{sfn|Knights|2004|pp=168–174}} This was notoriously the age of [[rotten borough|"rotten"]] and [[pocket borough|"pocket"]] boroughs, and Norwich was unusual in having such a high proportion of its citizens able to vote. "Of the political centres where the Jacobin propaganda had penetrated most deeply only Norwich and Nottingham had a franchise deep enough to allow radicals to make use of the electoral process."{{sfn|Thompson|1968|p=513}} "Apart from London, Norwich was probably still the largest of those boroughs which were democratically governed," says {{harvnb|Jewson|1975}}, describing other towns under the control of a single [[fief]]dom. In Norwich, he says, a powerful Anglican establishment, symbolised by the Cathedral and the great church of St Peter Mancroft was matched by scarcely less powerful [[wikt:congeries|congeries]] of Dissenters headed by the wealthy literate body [of Unitarians] worshipping at the [[Octagon Chapel, Norwich|Octagon Chapel]].{{sfn|Jewson|1975}}

[[File:Map of Norwich 1781.jpg|thumb|Map of Norwich 1781]]
In the middle of political disorders of the late 18th century, Norwich intellectual life flourished. It contained one, so far unmentioned characteristic: [[Harriet Martineau]] wrote of the city's ''literati'' of the period, which included such people as [[William Taylor (scholar)|William Taylor]], one of the first German scholars in England. The city "boasted of her intellectual supper-parties, where, amidst a pedantry which would now make laughter hold both his sides, there was much that was pleasant and salutary: and finally she called herself ''The Athens of England''."{{sfn|Martineau|1869}}

[[File:St Peter Mancroft.jpg|thumb|[[St Peter Mancroft]]]]
Notwithstanding Norwich's hitherto industrial prosperity, the wool trade was experiencing intense competition by the 1790s, from Yorkshire woollens and increasingly from Lancashire cottons. The effects were aggravated by the loss of continental markets after Britain went to war with France in 1793.{{efn|1={{harvnb|Hayes|1958}} Quote: "a major city manufacturer, and government supporter, Robert Harvey Jr as writing on 12 March 1793: 'The consequences of this just and inevitable war visit this poor city severely and suspend the operations of the Dutch, German and Italian trade and the only lingering employment in the manufactory is the completion of a few Russian orders, and the last China [[camlet|cambletts]] which I hope will find encouragement in the new East India Charter. This languid trade has doubled our poor rate and a voluntary subscription of above £2,000 is found inadequate to the exigencies of the poor."}} The early 19th century saw de-industrialisation accompanied by bitter squabbles. The 1820s were marked by wage cuts and personal recrimination against owners. So amid the rich commercial and cultural heritage of its recent past, Norwich suffered in the 1790s from incipient decline exacerbated by a serious trade recession.

As early in the war as 1793, a major city manufacturer and government supporter, Robert Harvey, complained of low order books, languid trade and a doubling of the poor rate.{{efn|1=Quotations and facts from {{harvtxt|Wilson|2004b}}}} As with many generations of their Norwich forebears, the hungry poor took their complaints on to the streets. Hayes describes a meeting of 200 people in a Norwich public house, at which "Citizen Stanhope" spoke.{{efn|1=Lord Stanhope was a radical peer, seen by many at the time as a dangerous menace. He is said to have given his rabble-rousing speech in a Norwich public house in 1794.}} The gathering "[roared its] applause at Stanhope's declaration that the Ministers, unless they changed their policy, deserved to have their heads brought to the block; – and if there was a people still in England, the event might turn out to be so." Hayes says that "the outbreak of war, in bringing the worsted manufacture almost to a standstill and so plunging the mass of the Norwich weavers into sudden distress made it almost inevitable that a crude appeal to working-class resentment should take the place of a temperate process of education which the earliest reformers had intended."{{sfn|Hayes|1958|pp=242–243}}

At this period opposition to Pitt's government and their war came—in their case almost unanimously—from a circle of radical Dissenter intellectuals who are of interest in their own right  They included the Rigby, Taylor, Aitkin, Barbold, and Alderson families—all Unitarians, and some of the Quaker Gurneys (one of their girls, Elizabeth, was, under her married name Fry, to be famous campaigner for prison reform). Their activities included visits to revolutionary France (prior to the execution of Louis XVI), the earliest British research into German literature, studies on medical science, petitioning for parliamentary reform, and publishing a highbrow literary magazine called "The Cabinet" (in 1795). Their mixing of politics, religion and social campaigning was suspicious to Pitt and Windham—and caused Pitt to denounce Norwich as "the Jacobin city". Edmund Burke attacked John Gurney in print for his sponsoring anti-war protests. Politics aside, it is safe to say that Norwich was the most active intellectual hotbed outside London in the 1790s, and did not achieve a comparable prominence until the University of East of Anglia arrived in the late 20th century.

By 1795 it was not just the Norwich rabble who were causing the government concern. In April that year the Norwich Patriotic Society was established, its manifesto declaring "that the great end of civil society was general happiness; that every individual &hellip; had a right to share in the government &hellip;"{{sfn|Jewson|1975|p=66}} In December the price of bread reached its highest yet, and in May 1796, when William Windham was forced to seek re-election following his appointment as war secretary, he only just held his seat.{{efn|1=Prior to the 20th century it was the practice that a sitting member, upon appointment to ministerial office, was obliged to seek re-election.}} Amid the same disorder and violence as was often the case with Norwich elections, it was only by the narrowest of margins that the radical Bartlett Gurney, campaigning on the platform of "Peace and Gurney – No More War – No more Barley Bread" failed to unseat him.{{sfn|Thompson|1994}}

Though informed by issues of recent national importance, the two-sided political culture of Norwich in the 1790s cannot be totally disconnected from local tradition. Two features stand out from a political continuum of three centuries. The first is the dichotomous power balance. From at least the time of the Reformation, there is a record of Norwich as a "two-party city". In the mid-16th century the weaving parishes actually fell under the control of opposition forces, as Kett's rebels held the north of the river, in support of poor cloth workers. Secondly, there seems to be a case for saying that with this tradition of two-sided disputation, the city had over a long period of time developed an infrastructure, evident in her many cultural and institutional networks of politics, religion, society, news media and the arts, whereby argument could be managed short of outright confrontation. Indeed at a time of hunger and tension on the Norwich streets, with the alehouse crowds ready to have "a Minister's head brought to the block", the Anglican and Dissenting clergy were doing their best to conduct a collegiate dialogue, seeking common ground, and reinforcing the same well-mannered civic tradition of consensus as that illustrated by historians of earlier periods.

[[File:Surrey House on Surrey Street - geograph.org.uk - 22919.jpg|thumb|left|[[Surrey House]], historic headquarters of the Norwich Union insurance company]]
In 1797 [[Thomas Bignold]], a 36-year-old wine merchant and banker, founded the first [[Norwich Union|Norwich Union Society]]. Some years earlier, when he moved from Kent to Norwich, Bignold had been unable to find anyone willing to insure him against the threat from highwaymen. With the entrepreneurial thought that nothing was impossible, and aware that in a city built largely of wood the threat of fire was uppermost in people's minds, Bignold formed the "Norwich Union Society for the Insurance of Houses, Stock and Merchandise from Fire". The new business, which became known as the Norwich Union Fire Insurance Office, was a "mutual" enterprise. [[Aviva|Norwich Union]] was later to become the country's largest insurance giant.

From earliest times, Norwich was a textile centre. In the 1780s, the manufacture of Norwich [[shawl]]s became an important industry<ref>[http://www.museums.norfolk.gov.uk/Research/Academic_Articles/Social_History/Norwich_Shawls/index.htm Norfolk Museums & Archaeology Service website] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120324192534/http://www.museums.norfolk.gov.uk/Research/Academic_Articles/Social_History/Norwich_Shawls/index.htm |date=24 March 2012 }}—"Norwich Shawls"</ref> and remained so for nearly a hundred years. The shawls were a high-quality fashion product and rivalled those made in other towns such as [[Paisley, Renfrewshire|Paisley]] (which entered shawl manufacture in about 1805, some 20 or more years after Norwich). With changes in women's fashion in the later [[Victorian period]], the popularity of shawls declined and eventually manufacture ceased. Examples of Norwich shawls are now highly sought after by collectors of textiles.

Norwich's geographical isolation was such that until 1845, when a railway connection was established, it was often quicker to travel to [[Amsterdam]] by boat than to London. The railway was introduced to Norwich by [[Samuel Morton Peto|Morton Peto]], who also built the line to [[Great Yarmouth]]. From 1808 to 1814, Norwich had a station in the [[Semaphore line|shutter telegraph chain]] that connected the [[Admiralty]] in London to its naval ships in the port of [[Great Yarmouth]]. A permanent military presence was established in the city with the completion of [[Britannia Barracks]] in 1897.<ref name=museum>{{cite web|url=http://www.rnrm.org.uk/web_trail/web_bar_02.html|title=Britannia Barracks|publisher=Royal Norfolk Regiment Museum|accessdate=9 November 2014}}</ref> The [[Bethel Street drill hall, Norwich|Bethel Street]] and [[Cattle Market Street drill hall, Norwich|Cattle Market Street]] [[drill hall]]s were built around the same time.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.drillhalls.org/Counties/Norfolk/TownNorwich.htm|title=Norwich|publisher=Drill halls project|accessdate=16 July 2017}}</ref>

===20th century===
[[File:Norfolk Terrace.JPG|thumb|UEA's [[Brutalist architecture|Brutalist]] [[ziggurat]]s. The university opened in 1963.]]
In the early part of the 20th century Norwich still had several major manufacturing industries. Among them were the manufacture of shoes (for example the [[Start-rite]] and Van Dal brands), clothing, joinery (including the cabinet makers and furniture retailer [[Arthur Brett and Sons]], which continues in business in the 21st century), and structural engineering, as well as aircraft design and manufacture. Important employers included [[Boulton & Paul]], Barnards (ironfounders, and inventors of machine produced [[wire netting]]), and electrical engineers Laurence Scott and Electromotors.

Norwich also has a long association with chocolate manufacture, primarily through the local firm of Caley's, which began as a manufacturer and bottler of mineral water and later diversified into making chocolate and [[Christmas crackers]]. The Caley's cracker-manufacturing business was taken over by Tom Smith<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tomsmithcrackers.co.uk/ |title=Tom Smith Crackers |publisher=Tom Smith Crackers |accessdate=13 September 2013}}</ref> in 1953, and the Norwich factory in Salhouse Road eventually closed in 1998. Caley's was acquired by Mackintosh in the 1930s, and merged with [[Rowntree's]] in 1969 to become Rowntree-Mackintosh. Finally, it was bought by [[Nestlé]] and closed in 1996, with all operations moving to [[York]] after an association of 120 years with Norwich. The demolished factory stood on the site of what is now the Chapelfield development. Caley's chocolate has since made a reappearance as a brand in the city, although it is no longer made in Norwich.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.edp24.co.uk/content/edp24/news/story.aspx?brand=EDPOnline&category=News&tBrand=EDPOnline&tCategory=xDefault&itemid=NOED17%20Jul%202010%2008%3A08%3A21%3A243|publisher=Eastern Daily Press|title=Caley's New Cocoa Cafe..|accessdate=17 July 2010}}</ref>

[[HMSO]], once the official publishing and stationery arm of the British government and one of the largest print buyers, printers and suppliers of office equipment in the UK, moved most of its operations from London to Norwich in the 1970s. It occupied the purpose-built 1968 Sovereign House building, near Anglia Square, which, in 2017, stands empty, and is due for demolition if the long-postponed redevelopment of Anglia Square goes ahead.

[[File:Jarrolds.JPG|thumb|[[Jarrolds]] department store has been based in Norwich since 1823.]]
[[Jarrolds]], established in 1810, was a nationally well-known printer and publisher. In 2004, after nearly 200 years, the printing and publishing businesses were sold. Today, the company remains privately owned and the Jarrold name is now best known and recognised as being that of Norwich's only independent [[department store]]. The company is also active in property development in Norwich and has a business training division.<ref>[http://www.jarrold.co.uk/index.html Jarrold's store] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091101022117/http://www.jarrold.co.uk/index.html |date=1 November 2009 }} Retrieved 16 November 2009.</ref>

==== Pubs and brewing ====
The city was home to a long-established tradition of brewing,<ref>[http://www.museums.norfolk.gov.uk/default.asp?Document=400.740.51x2 Norfolk Museums & Archaeology Service website] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110727215221/http://www.museums.norfolk.gov.uk/default.asp?Document=400.740.51x2 |date=27 July 2011 }} — "Brewing in Norwich".</ref> with several large [[brewery|breweries]] continuing in business into the second half of the century. The main ones were Morgans, Steward and Patteson, Youngs Crawshay and Youngs, Bullard and Son, and the Norwich Brewery. Despite takeovers and consolidation in the 1950s and 1960s, by the 1970s only the Norwich Brewery (owned by [[Watney Combe & Reid|Watney Mann]] and on the site of Morgans) remained. That too closed in 1985 and was subsequently demolished. Only [[Microbrewery|microbreweries]] can be found today.

It was stated by Walter Wicks in his book that Norwich once had "a pub for every day of the year, and a church for every Sunday". This was in fact significantly under the actual amount, with the highest number of pubs in the city was in the year 1870, with over 780 beer-houses. A Licensing Act in 1872, had several detrimental effects for landlords and customers, with the total number of pubs dropping to 634.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}} A "Drink Map" was produced in 1892,{{by whom|date=August 2018}} which showed 631 pubs in and around the city centre and surrounding districts. By 1900, the number had dropped to 441 pubs within the City Walls. The title of a pub for every day of the year survived until 1966, when the Chief Constable informed the Licensing Justices that only 355 licences were still operative{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}, with the number slowly shrinking, as over 25 have closed in the last decade.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.edp24.co.uk/news/the-city-of-pubs-but-more-than-25-have-closed-in-the-past-decade-1-5176681|title=The city of pubs – but more than 25 have closed in the past decade|last=Betts|first=Marc|work=Eastern Daily Press|access-date=2018-08-29|language=en}}</ref> As of 2018, around 100 pubs still trade in the city centre and surrounding areas.

====Nazi bombing of Norwich====

{{main|Norwich Blitz}}

Norwich suffered extensive bomb damage during World War II, affecting large parts of the old city centre and Victorian terrace housing around the centre. Industry and the rail infrastructure also suffered. The heaviest raids occurred on the nights of 27/28 and 29/30 April 1942; as part of the [[Baedeker raids]] (so-called because Baedeker's series of tourist guides to the [[British Isles]] were used to select propaganda-rich targets of cultural and historic significance rather than strategic importance). [[Lord Haw-Haw]] made reference to the imminent destruction of Norwich's new [[City Hall, Norwich|City Hall]] (completed in 1938), although in the event it survived unscathed. Significant targets hit included the Morgan's Brewery building, [[Colman's]] [[Wincarnis]] works, [[Norwich City railway station|City Station]], the Mackintosh chocolate factory, and shopping areas including St Stephen's St and St Benedict's St, the site of Bond's [[department store]] (now [[John Lewis (department store)|John Lewis]]) and Curl's department store.
229 citizens were killed in the two [[Baedeker Blitz|Baedeker raids]] with 1000 others injured, and 340 by bombing throughout the war—giving Norwich the highest air raid casualties in Eastern England. Out of the 35,000 domestic dwellings in Norwich, 2,000 were destroyed, and another 27,000 suffered some damage.<ref name="oldcity.org.uk">{{Cite web|url=http://www.oldcity.org.uk/norwich/history/history09.php|title=A History of Norwich - 20th Century Norwich|website=www.oldcity.org.uk|access-date=2018-08-05}}</ref> In 1945 the city was also the intended target of a brief V2 rocket campaign, though all these missed the city. (Sources: 4 Civil Defence Region bombing reports at National Archive; M J F Bowyer "Air Raid").

====Post-Second World War redevelopment====
As the war ended, the city council revealed what it had been working on before the war. It was published as a book - 'The City of Norwich Plan 1945' or commonly known as 'The '45 Plan' <ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.invisibleworks.co.uk/the-1945-plan/|title=Imagined futures past: '45 Plan - Invisible Works|date=2014-05-13|work=Invisible Works|access-date=2018-08-05|language=en-GB}}</ref> - a grandiose scheme of massive redevelopment which never properly materialised. However, the ten years between 1960 and 1970 completely altered the city, and significantly large areas of Norwich were cleared to make way for modern redevelopment.

In 1960, the inner-city district of Richmond, locally known as 'the Village on the Hill' was condemned as slums, and many residents were forced to leave due to [[compulsory purchase order]]s on the old terraces and lanes. The whole borough was demolished, which consisted of around 56 acres of existing streets, including 833 dwellings (612 considered unfit for human habitation), 42 shops, 4 offices, 22 public houses and 2 schools.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.eveningnews24.co.uk/views/derek-james/returning-to-the-lost-village-on-the-hill-in-old-norwich-1-1697965|title=Returning to the lost "village on the hill" in old Norwich.|last=James|first=Derek|work=Norwich Evening News|access-date=2018-08-30|language=en}}</ref> Communities were moved to high rise buildings such as Normandie Tower, or new housing estates such as the Tuckswood Estate, that were being built around the city at the time. A new road, Rouen Road was developed in the area's place, which consists mainly of light industrial units and council flats. [[Ber Street, Norwich|Ber Street]], a once historical main road into the city had its whole eastern side demolished. The final part of St Peters Street (at the top of [[St Peter Mancroft]] church), along with large Georgian houses at the top of Bethel Street was demolished to make way for car park for the new City Library in 1961.<ref name="oldcity.org.uk"/> This later burnt down in April 1994, and in 2001, [[The Forum, Norwich|The Forum]] was built in its place.

Many more buildings were demolished during the construction of the inner-ring road, which saw an ancient road junction, Stump Cross with Tudor and Georgian buildings in Magdalen Street, Botolph Street and most notably Pitt Street, cleared to make way for a fly-over and [[Brutalist architecture|Brutalist]] concrete shopping centre, [[Anglia Square Shopping Centre, Norwich|Anglia Square]] and office blocks such as HMSO building Sovereign House. Other areas affected by the ring-road were Grapes Hill, a once narrow lane lined with Georgian and Victorian cottages, being cleared and widened to form a dual carriageway leading up in to a roundabout in 1970. Shortly before the construction of this roundabout, the city's old [[Chapel Field Road drill hall, Norwich|Drill Hall]] was demolished, along with parts of the original city wall and other larger townhouses along the start of Unthank Road. Its unusual name comes from the Unthank family who were local landowners. <ref>{{cite web |last1=James |first1=Derek |title=The real story behind Unthank Road |url=https://www.eveningnews24.co.uk/views/norwich-golden-triangle-unthank-derek-james-1-5352280 |website=Evening News}}</ref> The north westerly corner of Chapelfield Gardens was also cut off in order to accommodate the new roundabout. About a mile of Georgian houses along Chapelfield Road and Queens Road; which saw many houses that were built into the city walls, were bulldozed in 1964. This included the surrounding area near Vauxhall Street, consisting of Georgian cottages which were condemned as slums. Post-war housing and maisonettes flats now stand where the [[Rookery (slum)|Rookery slums]] once did. Some aspects of The '45 Plan were put into action, which saw large three-story Edwardian houses in Grove Avenue and Grove Road, and other large properties on Southwell Road, demolished in 1962 to make way for flat-roofed single story style maisonettes, that still stand today.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://norfolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/FULL/PICNOR/BIBENQ/155332801/2219614,5?FMT=IMG|title=Spydus - Image Display - Record 5 of 8|website=Civica|publisher=Norfolk County Council|language=en|access-date=2018-09-09}}</ref> Heigham Hall, a large Victorian manor house was also demolished in 1963, to build Dolphin Grove flats.

Further housing developments in the private and public sector took place after the Second World War, partly to accommodate the growing population of the city and also to replace condemned and bomb damaged areas, such as the Heigham Grove district between Barn Road and Old Palace Road, and West Pottergate off Dereham Road. Other central streets such as St Stephens Street was widened, firstly by [[Norwich Union]]'s new office blocks and shortly after redeveloped with new buildings after it suffered extensive damage during the [[Baedeker Blitz|Baedeker raids]]. On Surrey Street, many six-storey Georgian buildings were demolished to make way for Norwich Union's office. Other notable buildings that were lost were three theatres, Norwich Hippodrome on St Giles Street, which is now a multi-storey car park, The Grosvenor Rooms and the Electric Theatre of Prince of Wales Road, The Corn Hall on Exchange Street, the Free Library on Duke Street and the Great Eastern Hotel, that stood facing [[Norwich railway station|Norwich Station]].

==== Other notable events ====
In 1976 the city's pioneering spirit was on show when Motum Road in Norwich, allegedly the scene of "a number of accidents over the years", became the third road in Britain to be equipped with [[sleeping policemen]], intended to encourage adherence to the road's 30&nbsp;mph (48&nbsp;km/h) speed limit.<ref name=Autocar197605>{{cite journal| journal=[[Autocar (magazine)|Autocar]] |volume = 144 | issue = 4147 | authorlink =Peter Garnier (Ed)|title =News: Humps – another road|page = 2| date = 1 May 1976}}</ref> The bumps, installed at intervals of 50 and 150 yards, stretched 12 feet across the width of the road and their curved profile was, at its highest point, 4&nbsp;inches (10&nbsp;cm) high.<ref name=Autocar197605/> The responsible [[Transport Research Laboratory|quango]] gave an assurance that the experimental devices would be removed not more than one year after installation.<ref name=Autocar197605/>

From 1980 to 1985 the City became a frequent focus of national media due to the squatting of [[Argyle Street, Norwich|Argyle Street]], a Victorian street that was demolished in 1986, despite being the last street left to survive the Richmond Hill redevelopment.

===City and county councils===
Norwich has been governed by two tiers of [[local government in the United Kingdom|local government]] since the implementation of the [[Local Government Act 1972]]. The upper tier is [[Norfolk County Council]], which manages strategic services such as schools, social services and libraries across the county of [[Norfolk]]. The lower tier is Norwich City Council, which manages local services such as housing, planning, leisure and tourism.<ref>{{cite book |title=Local government in England and Wales: A Guide to the New System |year=1974 |publisher=[[HMSO]] |location=London |isbn=0-11-750847-0 |page=72}}</ref>

Norwich elects 13 county councillors to the 84-member county council. The city is divided into single-member electoral divisions, and county councillors are elected every four years.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.opsi.gov.uk/si/si2005/uksi_20050173_en.pdf |title=The County of Norfolk (Electoral Changes) Order 2005 |date=1 February 2005 |publisher=[[Office of Public Sector Information]] |accessdate=13 February 2010}}</ref>

Norwich City Council consists of 39 councillors elected to represent 13 [[ward (politics)|wards]] — three councillors per ward. Elections are held by thirds, where one councillor in each ward is elected annually for a four-year term, except in the year of county council elections.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.opsi.gov.uk/si/si2002/uksi_20023222_en.pdf |title=The City of Norwich (Electoral Changes) Order 2002 |date=18 December 2002 |publisher=[[Office of Public Sector Information]] |accessdate=13 February 2010}}</ref> It is currently controlled by the Labour Party.

The ceremonial head of the city is the [[List of Lord Mayors of Norwich|Lord Mayor]]; though now simply a ceremonial position, in the past the office carried considerable authority, with executive powers over the finances and affairs of the city council. {{As of|2017}}, the Lord Mayor is Cllr. David Fullman and the Deputy Lord Mayor is Cllr. Martin Schmierer. The office of mayor of Norwich dates from 1403 and was raised to the dignity of [[List of lord mayoralties and lord provostships in the United Kingdom|lord mayor]] in 1910 by [[Edward VII of the United Kingdom|Edward VII]] "in view of the position occupied by that city as the chief city of East Anglia and of its close association with His Majesty".<ref name=mayor>{{cite web|url=http://www.norwich.gov.uk/webapps/atoz/service_page.asp?id=1407&pid=1014 |title=Lord Mayor of Norwich |publisher=Norwich City Council |accessdate=13 February 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716110301/http://www.norwich.gov.uk/webapps/atoz/service_page.asp?id=1407&pid=1014 |archivedate=16 July 2011 |df= }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=The King and Norwich |newspaper=[[The Times]] |date=7 February 1910 }}</ref> The title was regranted on local government reorganisation in 1974.<ref>{{London Gazette|issue=46255|page=4400|date=4 April 1974}}</ref> From 1404 the citizens of Norwich, as a [[county corporate]], had the privilege of electing two sheriffs.

===Unitary status proposal===
In October 2006, the [[Department for Communities and Local Government]] produced a Local Government [[White paper|White Paper]] inviting councils to submit proposals for [[Unitary authority|unitary]] restructuring. Norwich submitted its proposal in January 2007, which was rejected in December 2007, as it did not meet all the rigorous criteria for acceptance. In February 2008, the [[Boundary Committee for England]] (from 1 April 2010 incorporated in the [[Local Government Boundary Commission for England]]), was asked to consider alternative proposals for the whole or part of Norfolk, including whether Norwich should become a unitary authority, separate from Norfolk County Council. In December 2009, the Boundary Committee recommended a single unitary authority covering all of Norfolk, including Norwich.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.norfolk.gov.uk/consumption/idcplg?IdcService=SS_GET_PAGE&nodeId=3679 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080801125709/http://www.norfolk.gov.uk/consumption/idcplg?IdcService=SS_GET_PAGE&nodeId=3679 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=1 August 2008 |title=Local Government White Paper, Strong and Prosperous Communities |publisher=Norfolk County Council |accessdate=10 September 2009 |df= }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.norwich.gov.uk/site_files/pages/City_Council__Unitary_Council__The_business_case.html |title=The business case for unitary Norwich |publisher=Norwich City Council |accessdate=13 February 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081207121634/http://www.norwich.gov.uk/site_files/pages/City_Council__Unitary_Council__The_business_case.html |archivedate=7 December 2008 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.communities.gov.uk/index.asp?id=1509022 |title=Proposals for future unitary structures: Stakeholder consultation |publisher=[[Communities and Local Government]] |accessdate=13 February 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20120919132719/http://www.communities.gov.uk/index.asp?id=1509022 |archivedate=19 September 2012 |df= }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.lgbce.org.uk/__documents/lgbce-documents/draftfinal-reports-and-consultation-papers/2009/norfolk-sr-final-dec09.pdf |title=Our advice to the Secretary of State on unitary local government in Norfolk (PDF Document) |publisher=The Boundary Committee |date=7 December 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120111080052/http://www.lgbce.org.uk/__documents/lgbce-documents/draftfinal-reports-and-consultation-papers/2009/norfolk-sr-final-dec09.pdf |archivedate=11 January 2012 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>

For the seventh consecutive year since 2006 it has been the most visited library in the UK, with 1.3 million visits in 2013.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/dec/11/norfolk-norwich-library-most-popular-top-20|title=Norfolk & Norwich Millennium tops list of most popular UK libraries|first=Liz|last=Bury|newspaper=The Guardian|location=London|date=11 December 2013|accessdate=25 February 2014}}</ref> The collections contains the [[2nd Air Division]] Memorial Library, a collection of material about American culture and the American relationship with East Anglia, especially the role of the [[United States Air Force]] on UK airbases throughout the Second World War and [[Cold War]]. Much of the collection was lost in the 1994 fire, but the collection has been restored by contributions from many veterans of the war, both European and American. The building also provides a venue for art exhibitions, concerts and events, although the city still lacks a dedicated concert venue.

Recent attempts to shed the backwater image of Norwich and market it as a popular tourist destination, as well as a centre for science, commerce, culture and the arts, have included the refurbishment of the [[Norwich Castle|Norwich Castle Museum]] and the opening of the Forum. The proposed new slogan for Norwich as ''England's Other City'' has been the subject of much discussion and controversy. It remains to be seen whether it will be finally adopted. A number of signs at the approaches to the city still display the traditional phrase: "Norwich — a fine city."

===Art and music===
Each year the [[Norfolk and Norwich Festival]] celebrates the arts, drawing many visitors into the city from all over eastern England. The [[Norwich Twenty Group]], founded in 1944, presents exhibitions of its members to promote awareness of modern art. Norwich was home to the first arts festival in Britain in 1772.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nnfestival.org.uk/about_us/history|title=Norfolk & Norwich Festival - About us - History|first=Silk Pearce |last=www.silkpearce.com|publisher=}}</ref>

[[Norwich Arts Centre]] is a notable live music venue, concert hall and theatre located in St Benedict's Street. OPEN in Bank Plain is a large, popular music and conference venue and the King of Hearts in Fye Bridge Street is another centre for art and music. Norwich has a thriving music scene based around local venues such as the University of East Anglia LCR, Norwich Arts Centre, [[The Waterfront, Norwich|The Waterfront]], The Owl Sanctuary, Epic Studios and The Blueberry. Live music, mostly contemporary musical genres, is also to be heard at a number of other [[public house]] and club venues around the city. The city is host to many artists that have achieved national and international recognition such as [[Cord (band)|Cord]], [[The Kabeedies]], [[Serious Drinking]], [[Tim Bowness]], [[Sennen (band)|Sennen]], [[Magoo (band)|Magoo]] and [[KaitO]]. Norwich is also the home of jazz and blues vocalist [[Albert Cooper (musician)|Albert Cooper]] (born 1931), who has performed on innumerable occasions in the city since 1954.

Norwich was selected to host the 2015 BBC [[Radio 1 Big Weekend]]. The event was held on 23–24 May in Earlham Park.<ref>BBC Big Weekend Norwich [http://www.bbc.co.uk/events/ewh8q9] Retrieved 5 April 2016</ref>

===Theatres===
[[File:St Swithin's church in St Benedicts Street, Norwich.jpg|thumb|[[Norwich Arts Centre]], opened in 1977, on St. Benedict's Street]]
[[File:Norwich Theatre Royal.JPG|thumb|The [[Theatre Royal, Norwich|Theatre Royal]], Norwich's largest theatre]]
[[File:NorwichPlayhouse.JPG|thumb|[[Norwich Playhouse]], located on St. George's Street]]

Norwich has theatres ranging in capacity from 100 to 1,300 seats and offering a wide variety of programmes. The [[Theatre Royal, Norwich|Theatre Royal]] is the largest and has been on its present site for nearly 250 years, through several rebuildings and many alterations. It has 1,300 seats and hosts a mix of national touring productions including musicals, dance, drama, family shows, stand-up comedians, opera and pop.

The [[Maddermarket Theatre]] opened in 1921 and was the first permanent recreation of an [[Elizabethan theatre]]. The founder was [[Nugent Monck]] who had worked with [[William Poel]]. The theatre is a [[Shakespearean]]-style playhouse and has a [[seating capacity]] of 310. [[Norwich Puppet Theatre]] was founded in 1979 by Ray and Joan DaSilva as a permanent base for their touring company and was first opened as a public venue in 1980, following the conversion of the medieval church of St. James in the heart of Norwich. Under subsequent artistic directors — Barry Smith and Luis Z. Boy — the theatre established its current pattern of operation. It is a nationally unique venue dedicated to puppetry, and currently houses a 185-seat raked auditorium, the 50-seat Octagon Studio, workshops, an exhibition gallery, shop and licensed bar. It is the only theatre in the Eastern region with a year-round programme of family-centred entertainment. [[Norwich Arts Centre]] theatre opened in 1977 in St Benedict's Street, and has a capacity of 290. The [[Norwich Playhouse]], which opened in 1995 and has [[seating capacity]] of 300, is a venue in the heart of the city and one of the most modern performance spaces of its size in East Anglia.

The Garage studio theatre can seat up to 110 people in a range of layouts. It can also be used for standing events to accommodate up to 180 people. Platform Theatre is in the grounds of the City College Norwich. Productions are staged mainly during the autumn and summer months. The theatre is raked and seats about 250 people. On 20 April 2012, the theatre held a large relaunch event with an evening performance, show-casing it at its best with previews of upcoming performances and scenes from some of its past performances.<ref>[http://www.ccn.ac.uk/news/new-building-boost-creative-arts-city-college-norwich City College Norwich] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120406070519/http://www.ccn.ac.uk/news/new-building-boost-creative-arts-city-college-norwich |date=6 April 2012 }} Retrieved 23 March 2012</ref>

The Whiffler Theatre was built 1981 and was given to the people of Norwich by the local newspaper group Eastern Daily Press. It is an open-air facility in Norwich Castle Gardens, with fixed-raked seating for up to 80 people and standing for another 30 on the balcony. The stage is brick-built and has its dressing-rooms set in a small building to stage left. The Whiffler mainly plays host to small Shakespeare productions. [[Sewell Barn Theatre]] is the smallest theatre in Norwich and has a [[seating capacity]] of just 100. The auditorium features raked seating on three sides of an open acting space. This unusual staging helps to draw the audience closely into the performance.

Public performance spaces include the Forum in the city centre, which has a large open-air [[amphitheatre]], hosting performances of many types throughout the year. Additionally, the [[cloister]]s of Norwich Cathedral are used for open-air performances as part of an annual Shakespeare festival.<ref>[http://www.cathedral.org.uk/whats-on/shakespeare-in-the-cloisters-2013-tour.aspx Shakespeare in the cloisters] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130121155413/http://www.cathedral.org.uk/whats-on/shakespeare-in-the-cloisters-2013-tour.aspx |date=21 January 2013 }} Retrieved 13 December 2012</ref>

===Museums===
Norwich has a number of important museums which reflect the rich history of the city and of Norfolk as well as wider interests. The largest is [[Norwich Castle|Norwich Castle Museum]]. This has extensive collections of archaeological finds from the county of Norfolk, of art (including a fine collection of paintings by the [[Norwich School (art movement)|Norwich School of painters]]), of ceramics (including the largest collection of British teapots), of silver, and of natural history. Of particular interest are dioramas of Norfolk scenery, showing wildlife and landscape. It has been extensively remodelled to enhance the display of the many collections, and hosts frequent temporary exhibitions of art and other subjects.<ref>[http://www.museums.norfolk.gov.uk/Visit_Us/Norwich_Castle/index.htm Norfolk Museums and Archaeology Service website] – Norwich Castle Museum and Art Gallery</ref>

The Museum of Norwich (until 2014 called The Bridewell Museum), in Bridewell Alley, was closed in 2010 for a major refurbishment of the building and overhaul of the displays,<ref>[http://www.eveningnews24.co.uk/content/eveningnews24/norwich-news/story.aspx?brand=ENOnline&category=News&tBrand=ENOnline&tCategory=xNews&itemid=NOED06%20May%202010%2015%3A34%3A05%3A700 Eastern Evening News]—"Work begins on Norwich Bridewell Museum"</ref> and re-opened in July 2012.<ref>[http://www.edp24.co.uk/news/education/re_opening_of_norwich_s_bridewell_museum_delayed_until_next_year_1_815654 Eastern Daily Press 1 March 2011]– "Re-opening of Norwich's Bridewell Museum delayed."</ref><ref>[http://www.edp24.co.uk/news/click_clack_sound_to_return_to_norwich_after_loom_restored_during_1_5m_bridewell_revamp_1_1424120 Eastern Daily Press 28 June 2012]–"Click-clack sound to return to Norwich &hellip;"</ref> There are several galleries and groups of displays.

"Made in Norwich", "Industrious City" and "Shoemakers" have exhibits connected with the historic industries of Norwich, including weaving, shoe and boot making, iron foundries and the manufacture of metal goods, engineering, milling, brewing, chocolate-making and other food manufacturing. "Shopping and Trading" contains exhibits from the early 19th century to the 1960s.<ref>[http://www.museums.norfolk.gov.uk/Visit_Us/Museum_of_Norwich_at_the_Bridewell/index.htm Norfolk Museums and Archaeology Service website] – The Museum of Norwich at the Bridewell</ref>

[[Strangers' Hall]], at Charing Cross, is one of the oldest buildings in Norwich: a merchant's house dating from the early 14th century. The many rooms are furnished and equipped in the styles of different eras, from the [[Tudor period|Early Tudor]] to the [[Victorian era|Late Victorian]]. Exhibits include costumes and textiles, domestic objects, children's toys and games, and children's books. The last two collections are considered to be of national importance.<ref>[http://www.museums.norfolk.gov.uk/Visit_Us/Strangers_Hall/index.htm Norfolk Museums and Archaeology Service website] – Strangers’ Hall</ref>

The [[Royal Norfolk Regiment|Royal Norfolk Regimental Museum]] was, until 2011, housed in part of the former Shirehall, close to the castle. Although archives and the reserve collections are still held in the Shirehall, the principal museum display there closed in September 2011, and was relocated to the main Norwich Castle Museum, reopening fully in 2013.<ref>[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-norfolk-14292962 BBC Norfolk News 26 July 2011] "-Royal Norfolk Museum Moves to Norwich Castle"</ref> Its exhibits illustrate the history of the regiment from its 17th-century origins to its incorporation into the [[Royal Anglian Regiment]] in 1964, along with many aspects of military life in the regiment. There is an extensive and representative display of medals awarded to soldiers of the regiment, including two of the six [[Victoria Cross]]es won.<ref>[http://www.museums.norfolk.gov.uk/Visit_Us/Royal_Norfolk_Regimental_Museum/index.htm Norfolk Museums – Royal Norfolk Regiment museum]"- Royal Norfolk Regiment Museum at Norwich Castle</ref><ref>[http://www.rnrm.org.uk/index.html Royal Norfolk Regimental Museum website] – Royal Norfolk Regimental Museum</ref>

The [[City of Norwich Aviation Museum]] is located at [[Horsham St Faith|Horsham St. Faith]], on the northern edge of the city and close to [[Norwich International Airport|Norwich Airport]]. There are static displays of both military and civil aircraft, together with various collections of exhibits, including one concerned with the [[Eighth Air Force|United States 8th Army Air Force]].<ref>[http://www.cnam.org.uk City of Norwich Aviation Museum website] – Aviation Museum</ref> The John Jarrold [[Printing]] Museum, at Whitefriars, is dedicated to the history of printing and contains many examples of printing machinery, presses, books, and related equipment.

Many were donated by Jarrold Printing.<ref>[http://www.johnjarroldprintingmuseum.org.uk/home.html John Jarrold Printing Museum website] – John Jarrold Printing Museum</ref> In November 2018, redevelopment plans for the museum site caused some uncertainty about its future, but it has been announced that the museum will be relocated in the new development.<ref>[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-norfolk-45764356 BBC Norfolk news 5 October 2018] "Norwich printing museum: Owners seek new location"</ref><ref>[https://www.eveningnews24.co.uk/news/john-jarrold-printing-museum-in-norwich-to-relocate-1-5794094 Norwich Evening News 24 November 2018]"Norwich printing museum to relocate amid demolition plans"</ref> However, the proposed new museum will occupy a considerably smaller space, and concerns remain about the future number and scope of the exhibits. <ref>[https://www.edp24.co.uk/news/print-museum-pledge-fails-to-quell-objections-to-jarrold-s-norwich-site-scheme-1-5840554 Eastern Daily Press 4 January 2019] "Print Museum pledge fails to quell objections"</ref>

[[Dragon Hall, Norwich|Dragon Hall]], in King Street, is a fine example of a medieval merchants' trading hall. Mostly dating from about 1430, it is unique in Western Europe. In 2006 the building underwent a thorough restoration. Its magnificent architecture is complemented by displays showing the history of the building and its role in the life of Norwich through the ages. The Norfolk Museums and Archaeology Service Costume and Textiles Study Centre, at the Shirehall in Market Avenue, contains an extensive collection of more than 20,000 items, built up over a period of some 130 years, and previously kept in other Norwich museums. Although not a publicly open museum in the usual sense, the collection is accessible to the general public, students, researchers and others by prior appointment.<ref>[http://www.museums.norfolk.gov.uk/Visit_Us/Norwich_Castle_Study_Centre/index.htm/ Norwich Textiles website] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150706075947/http://www.museums.norfolk.gov.uk/Visit_Us/Norwich_Castle_Study_Centre/index.htm |date=6 July 2015 }}—Costumes and Textiles Study Centre</ref>

===Entertainment===
Norwich has three cinema complexes. [[Odeon Cinemas|Odeon]] Norwich is located in the Riverside Leisure Centre, [[Vue Cinemas|Vue]] in the Castle Mall and Hollywood Cinema at [[Anglia Square Shopping Centre, Norwich|Anglia Square]], north of the city centre. [[Norwich Cinema City|Cinema City]] is an art-house cinema showing non-mainstream productions operated by [[Picturehouse Cinemas|Picturehouse]] on St Andrews Street opposite [[St. Andrew's Hall, Norwich|St Andrew's Hall]], whose patron was actor [[John Hurt]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.edp24.co.uk/news/john_hurt_announced_as_new_patron_of_norwich_s_cinema_city_1_1996857|title=John Hurt announced as new patron of Norwich's Cinema City|date=29 March 2013|first=Sabbah|last=Meddings|newspaper=Eastern Daily Press|accessdate=26 February 2014}}</ref> Owing to its agricultural history, Norwich has a large number of pubs throughout the city. Prince of Wales Road in the city centre, running from the Riverside district near [[Norwich railway station]] to Norwich Castle, is home to many pubs, bars and clubs.

===Media and film===
[[File:Anglia Television.JPG|thumb|Anglia House, the headquarters of Anglia Television, today [[ITV Anglia]]]]

Norwich is the headquarters of BBC East, its presence in the east of England, and [[BBC Radio Norfolk]], ''[[BBC Look East]]'', ''Inside Out'' and ''[[The Politics Show]]'' are all broadcast from BBC studios in The Forum. [[Independent radio]] stations based in Norwich include [[Heart Norwich|Heart]], [[Smooth Radio]], [[99.9 Radio Norwich]], and the University of East Anglia's Livewire 1350, an online station. A community station, [[Future Radio]], was launched on 6 August 2007.

[[ITV Anglia]], formerly [[Anglia Television]], is based in Norwich. Although one of the smaller ITV companies, it supplied the network with some of its most popular shows such as ''[[Tales of the Unexpected (TV series)|Tales of the Unexpected]]'', ''[[Survival (TV series)|Survival]]'' and ''[[Sale of the Century (UK game show)|Sale of the Century]]'' (1971–1983), which began each edition with [[John Benson (announcer)|John Benson]]'s enthusiastic announcement: "And now from Norwich, it's the quiz of the week!" The company also had a subsidiary called Anglia Multimedia, which produced educational content on CD and DVD mainly for schools, and was one of the three companies, along with [[Granada TV]] and the [[BBC]] vying for the right to produce a digital television station for English schools and colleges.

Launched in 1959, Anglia Television lost its independence in 1994 following a takeover by [[Meridian Broadcasting]] and subsequent mergers have seen it reduced from a significant producer of programmes to a regional news centre. The company is still based in Anglia House, the former Norfolk and Norwich Agricultural Hall, on Agricultural Hall Plain near Prince of Wales Road. However, despite the contraction of Anglia, television production in Norwich has by no means ended. Anglia's former network production centre at Magdalen Street has been taken over by Norfolk County Council and extensively re-vamped. After total investment of £4m from the East of England Development Agency (EEDA) it has re-opened as Epic Studios (East of England Production Innovation Centre). Degree courses in film and video are also run at the centre by Norwich University of the Arts. Epic has commercial, broadcast quality post-production facilities, a real-time virtual studio and a smaller HD discussion studio. The main studio opened as an HD facility in November 2008. Throughout 2008, the centre has concentrated on the development of new TV formats and has worked on pilot shows with Les Dennis, Gaby Roslin and Christopher Biggins.

[[Archant]] publishes two daily newspapers in Norwich, the ''[[Norwich Evening News]]'', and the regional ''[[Eastern Daily Press]]'' (EDP), and had its own television operation, [[Mustard TV]], which has now closed.

The character of [[Alan Partridge]] in the sitcom ''[[I'm Alan Partridge]]'' (1997–2002) and the comedy film ''[[Alan Partridge: Alpha Papa]]'' (2013) is a Norwich broadcaster played by [[Steve Coogan]].

===Esoteric associations===

Because Norwich was England's second city during the Middle Ages and Renaissance, it has, though little acknowledged, a number of significant associations with [[esoteric]] spirituality. It was the home of [[William Cuningham]], a physician who published ''An Invective Epistle in Defense of Astrologers'' in 1560.<ref>Bryan's Dictionary of Painters and Engravers by Michael Bryan, edited by Robert Edmund Graves and Sir Walter Armstrong, an 1886–1889 publication now in the public domain</ref> The [[Elizabethan era|Elizabethan]] dramatist [[Robert Greene (dramatist)|Robert Greene]], author of [[Friar Bacon and Friar Bungay]], was born in Norwich in 1558.The city was also the retirement residence of [[Arthur Dee]] (died Norwich, 1651) the eldest son of the alchemist [[John Dee]]{{sfn|Fleay|1891|pp=251–252}}<ref>Dictionary of National Biography, 1885–1900, Volume 14</ref> [[File:St John the Baptist Church - The Layer Monument.jpg|thumb|The Layer Monument, marble polychrome c. 1600]]

Norwich was also the residence of the physician and [[hermeticism|hermetic]] philosopher Sir [[Thomas Browne]], author of [[The Garden of Cyrus]] (1658). Many influential esoteric books-titles are listed as once in Browne's [[Library of Sir Thomas Browne#Esoteric|library]].<ref>Catalogue of the libraries of Sir Thomas Browne and his son Edward Browne, edited with an introduction by J.S.Finch E.J.Brill Publications 1986</ref> His coffin-plate, on display at the church of [[St Peter Mancroft]], alludes to [[Paracelsian]] medicine and alchemy. Translated from Latin it reads, ''Great Virtues, &hellip; sleeping here the dust of his [[spagyric]] body converts the lead to gold''. Browne is also a significant figure in the history of [[physiognomy]].

The [[Church of St John Maddermarket]]'s graveyard includes the Crabtree headstone, which has the pre-Christian symbol of the [[Ouroboros]] along with [[Masonic]] [[Square and Compasses]] carved upon it. Housed within the church there is [[the Layer Monument]], a rare example of an alchemical [[mandala]] in European funerary art.{{sfn|Faulkner|2013}}

From 1787 the congregation of the [[New Jerusalem Church]] of [[Swedenborgians]], followers of the mystic [[Emanuel Swedenborg]], worshipped at the church of St. Mary the Less; in 1852 they moved to Park Lane, Norwich to establish the Swedenborgian Chapel.<ref>[http://www.norwich-churches.org/St%20Mary%20the%20Less/home.shtm Norwich historic churches – St Mary the Less] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131016080407/http://www.norwich-churches.org/St%20Mary%20the%20Less/home.shtm |date=16 October 2013 }} Retrieved 9 October 2013</ref><ref>[http://www.norfolkchurches.co.uk/norwichsweden/norwichsweden.htm Norfolk Churches – Swedenborgian Chapel] Retrieved 8 October 2013</ref>

==Architecture==
{{See also|Grade I listed buildings in Norwich|Grade II* listed buildings in Norwich}}
Norwich has a wealth of historical architecture. The medieval period is represented by the 11th-century [[Norwich Cathedral]], 12th-century [[castle]] (now a museum) and a large number of [[parish church]]es. During the [[Middle Ages]], 57 churches stood within the city wall; 31 still exist today, and seven are still used for worship.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.norwich-churches.org/map/map.shtm |title = Norwich Churches – Map |work = Norwich Churches |accessdate = 28 May 2015 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20150624152503/http://www.norwich-churches.org/map/map.shtm |archive-date = 24 June 2015 |dead-url = yes |df = dmy-all }}</ref> <!-- It is claimed that Norwich has more churches per square mile than anywhere else in Europe.—who claims? restore when citation found --> This gave rise to the common regional saying that it had a church for every week of the year, and a pub for every day.

Notable examples of [[Secularity|secular]] medieval architecture are [[Dragon Hall, Norwich|Dragon Hall]], built in about 1430, and [[Norwich Guildhall|The Guildhall]], built 1407–1413, with later additions. From the 18th century the pre-eminent local name is [[Thomas Ivory]], who built the Assembly Rooms (1776), the Octagon Chapel (1756), St Helen's House (1752) in the grounds of the [[Great Hospital]], and innovative speculative housing in Surrey Street (c. 1761). Ivory should not be confused with the Irish architect of the same name and similar period.

The 19th century saw an explosion in Norwich's size and much of its housing stock, as well as commercial building in the city centre, dates from this period. The local architect of the [[Victorian era|Victorian]] and [[Edwardian era|Edwardian]] periods who has continued to command most critical respect was [[George Skipper]] (1856–1948). Examples of his work include the headquarters of [[Norwich Union]] on Surrey Street; the [[Art Nouveau]] Royal Arcade; and the Hotel de Paris in the nearby seaside town of [[Cromer]]. The [[neo-Gothic]] Roman Catholic [[St John the Baptist Cathedral, Norwich|cathedral]] dedicated to [[St John the Baptist]] on [[Earlham Road]], begun in 1882, is by [[George Gilbert Scott Junior]] and his brother, [[John Oldrid Scott]].

The city continued to grow through the 20th century, and much housing, particularly in areas further out from the city centre, dates from that century. The first notable building post-Skipper was the [[City Hall, Norwich|City Hall]] by CH James and SR Pierce, opened in 1938; at the same time, they moved the [[Norwich War Memorial|City War Memorial]], designed by [[Sir Edwin Lutyens]], to sit in a memorial garden between the city hall and the market place. Bombing during the Second World War, while resulting in relatively little loss of life, caused significant damage to housing stock in the city centre. Much of the replacement postwar stock was designed by the local authority architect, David Percival. However, the major postwar development in Norwich from an architectural point of view was the opening of the [[University of East Anglia]] in 1964. Originally designed by [[Denys Lasdun]] (his design was never completely executed), it has been added to over subsequent decades by major names such as [[Norman Foster, Baron Foster of Thames Bank|Norman Foster]] and [[Rick Mather]].

===Parks, gardens and open spaces===
[[File:Riverside Flats Norwich - geograph.org.uk - 73621.jpg|thumb|Riverside flats Norwich]]
''See also [[List of parks, gardens and open spaces in Norwich]]''

Chapelfield Gardens in central Norwich became the city's first [[public park]] in November 1880. From the start of the 20th century, Norwich Corporation, now Norwich City Council, began buying and leasing land to develop parks when funds became available.

[[File:Norwich City Football Ground "Carrow Road" - geograph.org.uk - 43449.jpg|thumb|[[Carrow Road]] – the home of [[Norwich City F.C.]]]] The principal local [[association football|football]] club is [[Norwich City F.C.|Norwich City]], also known as the ''Canaries'', who play in the second tier of English football, the Championship, after being relegated from the Premier League at the end of the 2015–16 season. Majority-owned by celebrity chef [[Delia Smith]] and her husband Michael Wynn-Jones, their ground is at [[Carrow Road]]. They have a strong [[East Anglian Derby|East Anglian rivalry]] with [[Ipswich Town F.C.|Ipswich Town]]. The club has enjoyed considerable success in the past, having played in the top division regularly since 1972, their longest spell being a nine-year run from 1986 to 1995. They have also won two [[Football League Cup]]s, and finished third in the inaugural [[Premier League]] in 1993. They were relegated two years later and did not reclaim their top flight place for nine years, going down again after just one season, only to return in 2011 after two successive promotions.

Perhaps Norwich City's most famous result to date came later in 1993 when they eliminated German giants [[Bayern Munich]] from the [[UEFA Cup]], in what is to date their only season in European competitions; they had qualified for the UEFA Cup three times between 1985 and 1989 but were unable to compete as there was a ban on English clubs in European competitions at the time. Before emerging as a top division club, they famously eliminated [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] from the FA Cup in 1959, and went on to reach the semi-finals of the competition, a run they achieved again in 1989 and most recently in 1992. In the 1980s and early 1990s, the club produced some of the most highly rated talent of that era, including striker [[Chris Sutton]], winger [[Ruel Fox]], defender [[Andy Linighan]], midfielder [[Mike Phelan]], midfielder [[Tim Sherwood]] and striker [[Justin Fashanu]]. The club's most successful managers have included [[Kenneth Brown (footballer born 1934)|Ken Brown]], [[Ron Saunders]], [[Dave Stringer]], [[Mike Walker (Welsh footballer)|Mike Walker]], [[Nigel Worthington]] and [[Paul Lambert]].

The city's second club, [[Norwich United F.C.|Norwich United]] (who are based in [[Blofield]] some {{convert|8|km|mi}} east of the city) and [[Norwich CBS F.C.|Norwich CBS]] play in the [[Eastern Counties Football League|Eastern Counties League]]. The now-defunct [[Gothic F.C.|Gothic]] were also based in Norwich. Local football clubs are served by the [[Norwich and District Saturday Football League]].

Norwich also has an [[athletics (sport)|athletics]] club, City of Norwich AC (CoNAC), a [[rugby football|rugby]] club, the Norwich Lions, and a [[Team handball|handball]] Club, Norwich HC.

Norwich also has five [[field hockey]] clubs. In the 2012/13 season the club playing the highest level on the men's side will be Norwich City Hockey Club<ref>[http://www.norwichcityhc.co.uk/ Norwich City Hockey Club] Retrieved 18 September 2012</ref>  in the East Hockey Premier B, which is two levels below National League.  The second highest level is Norwich Dragons in Division Two North, then the students only [[University of East Anglia]] Men's Hockey Club in Division Three North East, then Norfolk Nomads Men's Hockey Club in Division Six North East.  On the Ladies' side of the game both Norwich City Hockey Club and Norwich Dragons Hockey club play in East Hockey's Division One North, two levels below National League. Following them the students from the [[University of East Anglia]] Women's Hockey Club play in the Norfolk Premier Division.  Also in Norwich there is the veterans only side Norwich Exiles.

Outside the city boundary, the dry ski and snowboarding slopes of Norfolk Ski Club is located at Whitlingham Lane in [[Trowse]].

[[Motorcycle speedway|Speedway]] racing was staged in Norwich both before and after World War II at The Firs Stadium on the Holt Road, [[Hellesdon]]. The [[Norwich Stars]] raced in the Northern League of 1946 and the [[Speedway National League Division Two|National League Division Two]] between 1947 and 1951, winning it in 1951. They were subsequently elevated to the [[National League (1932–1964)|National League]] and raced at the top flight until the stadium was closed at the end of the 1964 season.<ref>[http://www.speedwayresearcher.org.uk/norwich.html Norwich Speedway] Retrieved 17 January 2008</ref> One meeting was staged at a venue at [[Hevingham]] but the event, staged without an official permit, did not lead to a revival of the sport in the Norwich area.

== Economy and infrastructure ==
[[File:2004 norwich 06.JPG|thumb|The Royal Arcade, designed by [[George Skipper]], opened in 1899.]]

Norwich's economy was historically manufacturing based, with a large shoemaking industry, but transitioned throughout the 1980s and 1990s to a service-based economy.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Montague|first1=Ros|title=Norwich Shoemaking: From Howlett and White to Norvic|url=https://norfolkrecordofficeblog.org/2016/11/10/norwich-shoemaking-from-howlett-and-white-to-norvic/|website=Norfolk Record Office Blog|publisher=Norfolk Record Office|accessdate=3 March 2017}}</ref>

New developments on the former [[Boulton and Paul]] site include the [[Riverside (Norwich)|Riverside]] entertainment complex with nightclubs and other venues featuring the usual national leisure brands. Nearby, the football stadium is being upgraded with more residential property development alongside the river Wensum.

[[Archant]], formerly known as Eastern Counties Newspapers (ECN), is a national publishing group that has grown out of the city's local newspapers and is headquartered in Norwich.

Norwich has long been associated with the manufacture of [[Mustard (condiment)|mustard]].

===Retail===
[[File:Norwich Market from Gentlemans Walk.jpg|thumb|Gentleman's Walk, showing the stalls of [[Norwich Market]], [[City Hall, Norwich|City Hall]] and the [[Norwich Guildhall|Guildhall]] (right)]]

Norwich was the eighth most prosperous shopping destination in the UK in 2006.<ref>[http://www.caci.co.uk/index.asp?url=press-060515.htm CACI web site] – CACI Retail Footprint, 2006</ref> Norwich has an [[Norwich Market|ancient market place]], established by the Normans between 1071 and 1074, which is today the largest six-days-a-week open-air market in England. In 2006, the market was downsized and redeveloped, and the new market stalls have proved controversial: with 20% less floorspace than the original stalls, higher rental and other charges, and inadequate rainwater handling, which has been unpopular with many stallholders and customers alike. In 2007 the local ''[[Norwich Evening News]]'' characterised Norwich Market as an ongoing conflict between the market traders and Norwich [[City Council]], which operates the market.<ref>[http://www.eveningnews24.co.uk/content/news/story.aspx?brand=ENOnline&category=News&tBrand=ENOnline&tCategory=news&itemid=NOED04%20Jan%202007%2012%3A46%3A06%3A363 Norwich Evening News web site] – Market is hit by new cash blow</ref>

The Castle Mall, a shopping centre designed by the local practice Lambert, Scott & Innes and opened in 1993, presents an ingenious solution to the problem of accommodating new retail space in a historic city-centre environment — the building is largely concealed underground and built into the side of a hill, with a public park created on its roof in the area south of the castle.

A second shopping mall, [[Intu Chapelfield]] (formally known as Chapelfield) was opened in 2005 on the site of a closed Caley's (later [[Rowntree Mackintosh]] and [[Nestlé]]) chocolate factory. Chapelfield opened in September 2005, featuring as its flagship department store [[House of Fraser]]. Detractors have criticised Chapelfield as unnecessary and damaging to local businesses; its presence has prompted smaller retailers to band together to promote the virtues of independent shops. Despite this, in August 2006 it was reported by the Javelin Group that Norwich was one of the top five retail destinations in the UK,<ref>{{cite news | publisher=Norwich Evening News | title = New centre sees city climb shops league| url = http://www.eveningnews24.co.uk/content/news/story.aspx?brand=ENOnline&category=News&tBrand=ENOnline&tCategory=news&itemid=NOED19%20Aug%202006%2013%3A37%3A04%3A253 | author=Jenkinson, Caroline | date = 19 August 2006 | accessdate =21 August 2006}}</ref> and in October 2006 the city centre was voted the best in the UK, in a shopping satisfaction survey run by Goldfish Credit Card.<ref>{{cite news|publisher=Norwich Evening News |title=Norwich is top of the shops |url=http://new.en24.co.uk/search/story.aspx?brand=ENOnline&category=News&itemid=NOED13%20Oct%202006%2010:00:29:760&tBrand=ENOnline&tCategory=search |author=Chessum, Dominic |date=13 October 2006 |accessdate=29 October 2006 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929201206/http://new.en24.co.uk/search/story.aspx?brand=ENOnline&category=News&itemid=NOED13%20Oct%202006%2010%3A00%3A29%3A760&tBrand=ENOnline&tCategory=search |archivedate=29 September 2007 |df= }}</ref>

A section of central Norwich, in an area approximately bounded by Bethel Street/Upper St Giles Street, Grapes Hill, St Benedict's and St Andrew's Hill/London Street/Castle Meadow, forms a [[quarter (urban subdivision)|quarter]] now known, and promoted, as [[Norwich Lanes]]. A series of mostly-pedestrianised small lanes, alleyways and streets, it is noted for its independent retailers, and eating and drinking establishments. The area also contains a number of the city's cultural attractions, including museums, theatres and other venues. As part of a nationwide drive to recognise the importance, and to maintain the character and individuality of Britain's high streets, Norwich Lanes was the Great British High Street Awards 2014 national winner in the "City" category.<ref>{{cite news | publisher = Eastern Daily Press | title =  Norwich Lanes wins national high street award | url = http://www.edp24.co.uk/news/norwich_lanes_wins_national_high_street_award_1_3839215 | date = 8 November 2014 | accessdate = 18 November 2014}}</ref>

To the north of the city centre is the [[Anglia Square Shopping Centre, Norwich|Anglia Square]] shopping centre. The centre and the surrounding area is to be redeveloped; demolition work was due to commence in 2010 after an archaeological dig (conducted in 2009 and due to the centre being located around the site of a Saxon fortified settlement).

===Air===
{{Main|Norwich Airport}}
Norwich Airport is a feeder to [[KLM]]'s [[Schiphol Airport|Schiphol]] hub. [[FlyBe]], [[Eastern Airways]] all serve Norwich. Through [[Bristow Helicopters]] Norwich airport serves the offshore oil and gas industry. There is a strong holiday charter flight business. The airport was originally the airfield of [[RAF Horsham St Faith]]. One of the old RAF hangars was once the home of [[Air UK]], which grew out of [[Air Anglia]] and was then absorbed by the Dutch airline KLM.

===Bicycle===
[[File:Norwich Whitlingham.png|thumb|[[Cycling]]]]
[[National Cycle Route]] [[National Cycle Route#Main routes|1]] passes through Norwich, linking [[Beccles]] and [[Fakenham]] (and eventually [[Dover]] and the [[Shetland Islands]]).<ref>[http://www.norwich.gov.uk/TransportAndStreets/Transport/Cycling/Documents/CyclingMapFront.pdf Norwich Cycle Map] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140202172939/http://www.norwich.gov.uk/TransportAndStreets/Transport/Cycling/Documents/CyclingMapFront.pdf |date=2 February 2014 }}</ref>

===Water===
The [[River Yare]] is navigable from the sea at [[Great Yarmouth]] up to Trowse, south of the city. From there the [[River Wensum]] is navigable into Norwich up to New Mills, and is crossed by the [[Novi Sad Friendship Bridge]]. Scheduled trips through the city and out to the nearby [[The Broads]] are run by City Boats from outside Norwich station and also Elm Hill. In June 2012, Norwich City Council gave permission for [[punt (boat)|punting]] on the River Wensum.<ref>[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-norfolk-18532389 BBC news report] Retrieved 24 November 2012</ref>

===Proposed developments===
In 2017 the first part of a new {{convert|11|km|mi|adj=on}} road, the [[Norwich Northern Distributor Road]], linking from the A1067 to the north west of the city to the A47 road to the east of Norwich was opened. The remainder of the road opened in 2018. There is also discussion of building the [[Norwich Western Link]] section from the A1067 to the A47 southern bypass to the west, as originally proposed.<ref name=EN24-1>{{cite web|url=http://www.eveningnews24.co.uk/content/news/story.aspx?brand=ENOnline&category=News&tBrand=ENOnline&tCategory=news&itemid=NOED17%20Dec%202009%2008%3A38%3A40%3A063|title=How NDR will help transport in Norwich|work=Evening News 24|accessdate=6 January 2010}}</ref>

[[Sustrans]] plans to build a bridge between the Riverside area and Whitlingham Country Park as part of the [[Connect2]] project, using funds from the [[National Lottery (United Kingdom)|National Lottery]]. The country park is currently cut off from the main residential areas by the River Yare and River Wensum.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sustransconnect2.org.uk/schemes/project_detail.php?id=119|title=Norwich, Connections to Whitlingham County Park|accessdate=23 November 2009}}</ref>

Other proposals in the Norwich Transport Strategy include limiting traffic on some roads, introducing five rapid bus links into the city, and creating a train/tram link to the [[Rackheath eco-town]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.eveningnews24.co.uk/content/news/story.aspx?brand=ENOnline&category=NewsSplash&tBrand=ENOnline&tCategory=NewsSplash&itemid=NOED17%20Dec%202009%2008%3A39%3A58%3A127|title=NDR is key to transport plans|work=Evening News 24|accessdate=6 January 2010}}</ref>

== Geography ==
Norwich is 100 miles (161 km) northeast of [[London]], 102 miles (164 km) east of [[Leicester]], 130 miles (209 km) east-northeast of [[Birmingham]], 40 miles (64 km) north of [[Ipswich]] and 65 miles (104 km) east of [[Peterborough]].

=== Climate ===
[[File:SeaFogEastAnglia.JPG|thumb|[[Sea fog]] clinging to the East Anglian coast, February 2008; Norwich is denoted by the yellow dot.]]
Norwich, like the rest of the [[British Isles]], has a temperate maritime climate. It does not suffer extreme temperatures, and benefits from rainfall fairly evenly spread throughout the year. [[Coltishall]], about {{convert|18|km|mi}} to the northeast, was the nearest official met-office weather station for which records are available, although it ceased reporting in early 2006 – now Norwich airport provides readings. Norwich's position in East Anglia, jutting out into the [[North Sea]] can produce weather conditions that have less effect on other parts of the country, such as snow or [[Rain and snow mixed|sleet]] showers during the winter months on a northerly or easterly wind, or sea fog/[[Haar (fog)|haar]] during the summer half of the year. An example of Norwich being afflicted by sea fog is shown in the adjacent image.

The highest temperature recorded at Coltishall was {{convert|33.1|C}}<ref>{{cite web

The nearest sunshine monitoring weather station for which records are available is [[Morley, Norfolk|Morley]] agricultural research centre, about {{convert|11|mi}} southwest of Norwich city centre. For the 1961–90 period, it averaged 1558 hours<ref>{{cite web
|url=http://www.cru.uea.ac.uk/cru/data/hulme/uk/morley.htm
|title=1961–90 average sunshine
|accessdate=1 March 2011}}</ref> of sunshine a year, a relatively high total for an inland part of the British Isles outside of southern England. In reality, given Norwich's position nearer to the coast and as such suffering from less convective cloud development during summer, true totals may even be slightly higher than this.

Rainfall, at around 650 millimetres (25 inches), is low, although as much as 100 millimetres (4 inches) higher than other, more sheltered parts of East Anglia, as Norwich is more prone to showers originating from the North Sea.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/public/weather/climate/u12gmt1fz| title=Climate Normals 1981–2010| publisher=Met Office| accessdate=4 August 2015}}</ref>

==Travellers' comments==
In 1507 the poet [[John Skelton]] (1460–1529) wrote of two destructive fires in his ''Lament for the City of Norwich''.
: ''All life is brief, and frail all man's estate. City, farewell: I mourn thy cruel fate''.

[[Thomas Fuller]] in his ''The Worthies of England'' described the City in 1662 as:
: ''Either a city in an orchard or an orchard in a city, so equally are houses and trees blended in it, so that the pleasure of the country and the populousness of the city meet here together. Yet in this mixture, the inhabitants participate nothing of the rusticalness of the one, but altogether the urbanity and civility of the other''.

[[Celia Fiennes]] (1662–1741) visited Norwich in 1698 and described it as
: '' a city walled full round of towers, except on the river side which serves as a wall; they seem the best in repair of any walled city I know''.

She also records that three times a year the city held:
: ''great fairs. &hellip; to which resort a vast concourse of people and wares a full trade'', Norwich being ''a rich, thriving industrious place full of weaving, knitting and dyeing''.

[[Daniel Defoe]] in his ''Tour of the whole Island of Great Britain'' (1724) wrote:
: ''the inhabitants being all busy at their manufactures, dwell in their garrets at their looms, in their combing-shops, so they call them, twisting-mills, and other work-houses; almost all the works they are employed in being done within doors''.

[[John Evelyn]] (1620–1706), royalist, traveller and diarist, wrote to [[Sir Thomas Browne]]:
: '' I hear Norwich is a place very much addicted to the flowery part''.

He visited the City as a courtier to [[Charles II of England|King Charles II]] in 1671 and described it thus:
: ''The suburbs are large, the prospect sweet, and other amenities, not omitting the flower-garden, which all the Inhabitants excel in of this City, the fabric of stuffs, which affords the Merchants, and brings a vast trade to this populous Town''.

[[George Borrow]] in his semi-autobiographical novel [[Lavengro]] (1851) wrote of Norwich as:
: ''A fine old city, perhaps the most curious specimen at present extant of the genuine old English Town &hellip;.There it spreads from north to south, with its venerable houses, its numerous gardens, its thrice twelve churches, its mighty mound &hellip;.There is an old grey castle on top of that mighty mound: and yonder rising three hundred feet above the soil, from amongst those noble forest trees, behold that old Norman master-work, that cloud-enriched cathedral spire &hellip;.Now who can wonder that the children of that fine old city are proud, and offer up prayers for her prosperity?''

Borrow wrote far less favourably of the City in his translation of [[Faust]]:
: ''They found the people of the place modelled after so unsightly a pattern, with such ugly figures and flat features that the devil owned he had never seen them equalled, except by the inhabitants of an English town, called Norwich, when dressed in their Sunday's best''.

In 1812, Andrew Robertson wrote to the painter [[Constable]]:
: ''I arrived here a week ago and find it a place where the arts are very much cultivated &hellip; some branches of knowledge, chemistry, botany, etc. are carried to a great length. General literature seems to be pursued with an ardour which is astonishing when we consider that it does not contain a university, as is merely a manufacturing town.''

In 1962, [[Nikolaus Pevsner|Sir Nikolaus Pevsner]] stated in his North-West Norfolk and Norwich volume of ''[[The Buildings of England]]'' that:
: ''Norwich is distinguished by a prouder sense of civic responsibility than any other town of about the same size in Britain.''
