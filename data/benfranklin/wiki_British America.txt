'''British America''' comprised the British Empire's colonial territories in North America, Bermuda, Central America, the Caribbean, and Guyana from 1607 to 1783. The American colonies were formally known as '''British America and the British West Indies''' before 1776, when the [[Thirteen Colonies]] declared their independence in the [[American Revolutionary War]] (1775–1783) and formed the United States of America.<ref>{{cite web|title=A Summary View of the Rights of British America – Thomas Jefferson|url=http://press-pubs.uchicago.edu/founders/documents/v1ch14s10.html}}</ref> After that, the term [[British North America]] was used to describe the remainder of Britain's continental North American possessions. That term was first used informally in 1783 by the end of the American Revolution, but it was uncommon before the [[Report on the Affairs of British North America]] (1839), called the Durham Report.

British America gained large amounts of new territory following the [[Treaty of Paris (1763)]] which ended the [[French and Indian War]] in America, and ended British involvement in the [[Great Britain in the Seven Years' War|Seven Years' War]] in Europe. At the start of the Revolutionary War in 1775, the British Empire included 20 colonies north and east of [[New Spain]], including areas of Mexico and the Western United States. [[East Florida|East]] and [[West Florida]] were ceded to the Kingdom of Spain in the [[Treaty of Paris (1783)]] which ended the American Revolution, and then ceded by Spain to the United States in 1819 after treaty negotiations to settle the old southwest border with [[Spanish Florida]] (eastern Louisiana, southern Alabama, Mississippi, and western Georgia). The remaining continental colonies of British North America to the northeast formed the [[Dominion of Canada]] by uniting provinces between 1867 and 1873. The [[Dominion of Newfoundland]] to the east joined Canada in 1949.

== History ==
{{Main|English overseas possessions#The Americas}}
{{further|First British Empire}}
A number of English colonies were established in North America between 1606 and 1670 by individuals and companies whose investors expected to reap rewards from their speculation. They were granted commercial charters by [[James VI and I|King James I]], [[Charles I of England|King Charles I]], Parliament, and [[Charles II of England|King Charles II]].  The first permanent settlement was founded in 1607 on the [[James River (Virginia)|James River]] at [[Jamestown, Virginia]] upstream from [[Chesapeake Bay]] by the [[London Company]]. This was followed in 1620 when the Pilgrims established the [[Plymouth settlement]] in [[New England]]. English Catholics settled the [[Province of Maryland]] in 1634, with [[Cecil Calvert, 2nd Baron Baltimore|Cecilus Calvert, second Lord Baltimore]].

In London beginning in 1660, all colonies were governed through a state department known as the Southern Department, and a committee of the Privy Council called the [[Board of Trade and Plantations]].  In 1768, a specific state department was created for America, but it was disbanded in 1782 when the Home Office took responsibility.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.com/en/article/colonial-office/ |title=Colonial Office |last=Foulds |first=Nancy Brown |website=The Canadian Encyclopedia |language=en |access-date=2018-07-07}}</ref>
