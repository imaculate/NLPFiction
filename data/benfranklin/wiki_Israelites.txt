In the [[Hebrew Bible]] the term ''Israelites'' is used interchangeably with the term ''[[Twelve Tribes of Israel]]''. Although related, the terms [[Hebrews]], Israelites, and [[Jews]] are not interchangeable in all instances. "Israelites" (''Yisraelim'') refers specifically to the direct descendants of any of the sons of the patriarch [[Jacob#Jewish tradition|Jacob]] (later called Israel), and his descendants as a people are also collectively called "Israel", including converts to their faith in worship of the [[God in Judaism|god of Israel]], [[Yahweh]]. "Hebrews" (''ʿIvrim''), on the contrary, is used to denote the Israelites' immediate forebears who dwelt in the [[land of Canaan]], the Israelites themselves, and the Israelites' ancient and modern descendants (including Jews and [[Samaritans]]). "Jews" (''Yehudim'') is used to denote the descendants of the Israelites who coalesced when the [[Tribe of Judah]] absorbed the remnants of various other Israelite tribes. Thus, for instance, Abraham was a Hebrew but he was not technically an Israelite nor a Jew, Jacob was both a Hebrew and the first Israelite but not a Jew, while [[David]] (as a member of the Tribe of Judah) was all three, a Hebrew, an Israelite, and a Judahite (''Yehudi'', Jew). A Samaritan, on the contrary, while being both a Hebrew and an Israelite, is not a Jew.

During the period of the divided monarchy "Israelites" was only used to refer to the inhabitants of the [[Kingdom of Israel (Samaria)|northern Kingdom of Israel]], and it is only extended to cover the people of the southern [[Kingdom of Judah]] in post-exilic usage.<ref>Robert L.Cate, "Israelite", in Watson E.

Finally, in [[Judaism]], the term "Israelite" is, broadly speaking, used to refer to a [[Layperson|lay]] member of the Jewish [[ethnoreligious group]], as opposed to the priestly orders of [[Kohanim]] and [[Levites]]. In texts of [[Jewish law]] such as the [[Mishnah]] and [[Gemara]], the term יהודי (''Yehudi''), meaning Jew, is rarely used, and instead the ethnonym ישראלי (''Yisraeli''), or Israelite, is widely used to refer to Jews. Samaritans commonly refer to themselves and to Jews collectively as Israelites, and they describe themselves as the Israelite Samaritans.<ref>Yesaahq ben 'Aamraam.

==Etymology==
[[File:Merneptah Israel Stele Cairo.JPG|thumb|upright|The [[Merneptah stele]]. While alternative translations exist, the majority of [[Biblical archaeology|biblical archaeologists]] translate a set of hieroglyphs as ''Israel'', representing the first instance of the name Israel in the historical record.]]

The term ''Israelite'' is the English name for the descendants of the [[biblical patriarch]] [[Jacob]] in ancient times, which is derived from the [[Greek language|Greek]] Ισραηλίτες,<ref>Strong's Exhaustive Concordance G2474</ref> which was used to translate the [[Biblical Hebrew]] term ''b'nei yisrael'', יִשְׂרָאֵל as either "sons of [[Jacob|Israel]]" or "children of Israel".<ref>Brown Drivers Briggs H3478</ref>

The name ''Israel'' first appears in the [[Hebrew Bible]] in {{Bibleverse||Genesis|32:29|HE}}. It refers to the renaming of Jacob, who, according to the Bible, [[Jacob wrestling with the angel|wrestled with an angel]], who gave him a blessing and renamed him ''Israel'' because he had "striven with God and with men, and have prevailed". The Hebrew Bible etymologizes the name as from ''yisra'' "to prevail over" or "to struggle/wrestle with", and ''[[El (god)|el]]'', "[[God]], the divine".<ref name="Scherman, Rabbi Nosson 2006, pages 176-77">Scherman, Rabbi Nosson (editor), ''The Chumash'', The Artscroll Series, Mesorah Publications, LTD, 2006, pp. 176–77</ref><ref name="Kaplan, Aryeh 1985, page 125">Kaplan, Aryeh, "Jewish Meditation", Schocken Books, New York, 1985, p. 125</ref>

The name ''Israel'' first appears in non-biblical sources c. 1209 BCE, in [[Merneptah stele|an inscription]] of the Egyptian pharaoh [[Merneptah]]. The inscription is very brief and says simply: "Israel is laid waste and his seed is not" (see below). The inscription refers to a people, not to an individual or a nation-state.<ref name="Greenspahn2008">{{cite book|author=Frederick E.

==Terminology==
{{See also|Hebrews|Assyrian captivity}}
In [[modern Hebrew]], ''b'nei yisrael'' ("children of Israel") can denote the [[Jewish people]] at any time in history; it is typically used to emphasize Jewish ethnic identity. From the period of the [[Mishna]] (but probably used before that period) the term ''Yisrael'' ("an Israel") acquired an additional narrower meaning of [[Jews]] of legitimate birth other than [[Levites]] and Aaronite priests (''[[kohen|kohanim]]''). In modern Hebrew this contrasts with the term ''Yisraeli'' (English "[[Israelis|Israeli]]"), a citizen of the modern State of [[Israel]], regardless of religion or ethnicity.

The term ''[[Hebrews|Hebrew]]'' has [[Eber]] as an [[eponym]]ous ancestor. It is used synonymously with "Israelites", or as an [[Ethnolinguistics|ethnolinguistic]] term for historical speakers of the [[Hebrew language]] in general.

The Greek term ''[[Ioudaioi]]'' ([[Jew (word)|Jews]]) was an [[Exonym and endonym|exonym]] originally referring to members of the [[Tribe of Judah]], which formed the nucleus of the [[kingdom of Judah]], and was later adopted as a self-designation by people in the [[diaspora]] who identified themselves as loyal to the God of Israel and the Temple in Jerusalem.<ref>Caroline Johnson Hodge,[https://books.google.com/books?id=Kd6ImHYoNUsC&pg=PA53 ''If Sons, Then Heirs: A Study of Kinship and Ethnicity in the Letters of Paul,''] Oxford University Press, 2007 pp. 52–55.</ref><ref>Markus Cromhout,[https://books.google.com/books?id=apHXBgAAQBAJ&pg=PA122 ''Jesus and Identity: Reconstructing Judean Ethnicity in Q,''] James Clarke & Co, 2015 pp. 121ff.</ref><ref>Daniel Lynwood Smith,[https://books.google.com/books?id=Yi7aBAAAQBAJ&pg=PA124  ''Into the World of the New Testament: Greco-Roman and Jewish Texts and Contexts,''] Bloomsbury Publishing, 2015 p. 124.</ref><ref>Stephen Sharot,[https://books.google.com/books?id=EAMLEM4lYlAC&pg=PA146 ''Comparative Perspectives on Judaisms and Jewish Identities,''] Wayne State University Press 2011 p. 146.</ref>

The [[Samaritans]], who claim descent from the tribes of [[Tribe of Ephraim|Ephraim]] and [[Tribe of Manasseh|Manasseh]] (plus [[Tribe of Levi|Levi]] through [[Aaron]] for [[kohen]]s), are named after the Israelite [[Kingdom of Israel (Samaria)|Kingdom of Samaria]], but until modern times many Jewish authorities contested their claimed lineage, deeming them to have been conquered foreigners who were [[Population transfer#Ancient world|settled]] in the Land of Israel by the Assyrians, as was the typical Assyrian policy to obliterate national identities. Today, Jews and Samaritans both recognize each other as communities with an authentic Israelite origin.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.israelite-samaritans.com/|title=Homepage of A.B Institute of Samaritan Studies|publisher=|accessdate=March 27, 2015}}</ref>

The terms "Jews" and "Samaritans" largely replaced the title "Children of Israel"<ref>''Settings of silver: an introduction to Judaism'', Stephen M. Wylen, Paulist Press, 2000, {{ISBN|0-8091-3960-X}}, p. 59</ref> as the commonly used ethnonym for each respective community.

==Historical Israelites==

{{History of Israel}}
Several theories exist proposing the origins of the Israelites in raiding groups, infiltrating nomads or emerging from indigenous Canaanites driven from the wealthier urban areas by poverty to seek their fortunes in the highland.<ref>Israel Finkelstein, Neil Asher Silberman, ''[[The Bible Unearthed]]'', Simon and Schuster 2002, p. 104.</ref> Various, ethnically distinct groups of itinerant nomads such as the [[Habiru]] and [[Shasu]] recorded in Egyptian texts as active in [[Edom]] and Canaan could have been related to the later Israelites, which does not exclude the possibility that the majority may have had their origins in Canaan proper. The name [[Yahweh]], the god of the later Israelites, may indicate connections with the region of [[Mount Seir]] in Edom.<ref name="Toorn" >K. van der Toorn,[https://books.google.com/books?id=VSJWkrXfbLQC&pg=PA282 ''Family Religion in Babylonia, Ugarit and Israel: Continuity and Changes in the Forms of Religious Life''], BRILL 1996 pp. 181, 282.</ref>

The prevailing academic opinion today is that the Israelites were a mixture of peoples predominantly indigenous to Canaan, although an Egyptian matrix of peoples may also have played a role in their ethnogenesis,<ref>Alan Mittleman, "Judaism: Covenant, Pluralism and Piety", in Bryan S. Turner (ed.) [https://books.google.com/books?id=RheC7rG9u6gC&pg=PA345 ''The New Blackwell Companion to the Sociology of Religion''], John Wiley & Sons, 2010 pp. 340–63, 346.</ref><ref name="Gottwald" /><ref>[[Richard A.

The language of the Canaanites may perhaps be best described as an "archaic form of Hebrew, standing in much the same relationship to the Hebrew of the Old Testament as does the language of Chaucer to modern English." The Canaanites were also the first people, as far as is known, to have used an [[alphabet]].<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/91488/Canaan |title= Canaan |work= Encyclopædia Britannica |accessdate= March 27, 2015}}</ref>

The name Israel first appears c. 1209 BCE, at the end of the [[Late Bronze Age]] and the very beginning of the period archaeologists and historians call [[Iron Age|Iron Age I]], on the [[Merneptah Stele]] raised by the Egyptian Pharaoh [[Merneptah]]. The inscription is very brief:
{{quote|<poem>

Seized upon is Gezer,
Yeno<sup>c</sup>am is made as that which does not exist
''Israel lies fallow, it has no seed'';
Ḫurru has become a widow because of Egypt.<ref name="Toorn" /></poem>}}

As distinct from the cities named ([[Ashkelon]], [[Gezer]], [[Yenoam]]) which are written with a [[toponym|toponymic marker]], Israel is written [[hieroglyph]]ically with a [[demonym]]ic [[determinative]] indicating that the reference is to a human group, variously located in central Palestine<ref name="Toorn" /> or the highlands of [[Samaria]].<ref>Grabbe 2008, p. 75</ref>

Over the next two hundred years (the period of Iron Age I) the number of [[Israelite highland settlement|highland villages]] increased from 25 to over 300<ref name=mcnutt47>McNutt 1999, p. 47.</ref> and the settled population doubled to 40,000.<ref name=mcnutt70>McNutt 1999, p. 70.</ref> By the 10th century BCE a rudimentary state had emerged in the north-central highlands,<ref>Joffe pp. 440ff.</ref> and in the 9th century this became a kingdom.<ref>Davies, 1992, pp. 63–64.</ref> Settlement in the southern highlands was minimal from the 12th through the 10th centuries BCE, but a state began to emerge there in the 9th century,<ref>Joffe pp. 448–49.</ref> and from 850 BCE onwards a series of inscriptions are evidence of a kingdom which its neighbours refer to as the "[[Davidic line|House of David]]."<ref>Joffe p. 450.</ref>

In the pre-exilic [[First Temple Period]] the political power of [[Judea]] was concentrated within the [[tribe of Judah]], [[Samaria]] was dominated by the [[tribe of Ephraim]] and the [[House of Joseph]], while the [[Galilee]] was associated with the [[tribe of Naphtali]], the most eminent tribe of northern Israel.<ref>Sefer Devariam Pereq לד, ב; Deuteronomy 34, 2, Sefer Yehoshua Pereq כ, ז; Joshua 20, 7, Sefer Yehoshua Pereq כא, לב; Joshua 21, 32, Sefer Melakhim Beth Pereq טו, כט; Second Kings 15, 29, Sefer Devrei Ha Yamim Aleph Pereq ו, סא; First Chronicles 6, 76</ref><ref>See File:12 Tribes of Israel Map.svg</ref> At the time of the Kingdom of Samaria, the Galilee was populated by northern tribes of Israel, but following the Babylonian exile the region became Jewish. During the [[Second Temple period]] relations between the Jews and Samaritans remained tense. In 120 BCE the Hasmonean king [[John Hyrcanus|Yohanan Hyrcanos I]] destroyed the Samaritan temple on [[Mount Gerizim]], due to the resentment between the two groups over a disagreement of whether [[Mount Moriah]] in [[Jerusalem]] or [[Mount Gerizim]] in [[Shechem]] was the actual site of the [[Aqedah]], and the chosen place for the [[Mishkan|Holy Temple]], a source of contention that had been growing since the two houses of the former [[Kingdom of Israel (united monarchy)|united monarchy]] first split asunder in 930 BCE and which had finally exploded into warfare.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.usc.edu/dept/LAS/arc/neapolis/samaritantemple.htm |title=Archived copy |access-date=August 12, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140812210127/http://www.usc.edu/dept/LAS/arc/neapolis/samaritantemple.htm |archive-date=August 12, 2014 |dead-url=yes |df=mdy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.antiquities.org.il/article_Item_eng.asp?sec_id=36&subj_id=286 |publisher= Israel Antiquities Authority |title=The Gathering at the President's House |accessdate= March 27, 2015 |author=Y.

The Israelite story begins with some of the [[culture hero]]es of the Jewish people, the [[Patriarch (Bible)|Patriarchs]]. The [[Torah]] traces the Israelites to the patriarch [[Jacob]], grandson of Abraham, who was renamed Israel after a mysterious incident in which he wrestles all night with God or an angel. Jacob's twelve sons (in order of birth), [[Reuben (Bible)|Reuben]], [[Simeon (Hebrew Bible)|Simeon]], [[Levi]], [[Judah (Bible)|Judah]], [[Dan (Bible)|Dan]], [[Naphtali]], [[Gad (son of Jacob)|Gad]], [[Asher]], [[Issachar]], [[Zebulun]], [[Joseph (Hebrew Bible)|Joseph]] and [[Benjamin]], become the ancestors of twelve tribes, with the exception of Joseph, whose two sons [[Manasseh (tribal patriarch)|Mannasseh]] and [[Ephraim]], who were adopted by Jacob, become tribal [[eponym]]s ({{Bibleverse||Genesis|48|HE}}).<ref name="wylen">[https://books.google.com/books?id=SHgiy-k_wsUC&lpg=PA18&pg=PA18#v=onepage&q&f=false ''The Jews in the time of Jesus: an introduction'' p. 18] Stephen M. Wylen, Paulist Press, 1996, 215 pages, pp. 18–20</ref>

The mothers of Jacob's sons are:
* [[Leah]]: Reuben, Simeon, Levi, Judah, Issachar, Zebulun
* [[Rachel]]: Joseph (Ephraim and Menasseh), Benjamin
* [[Bilhah]] (Rachel's maid): Dan, Naphtali
* [[Zilpah]] (Leah's maid): Gad, Asher ({{Bibleverse||Genesis|35:22–26|HE}})<ref name="wylen"/>

Jacob and his sons are forced by famine to go down into [[Ancient Egypt|Egypt]], although Joseph was already there, as he had been sold into slavery while young. When they arrive they and their families are 70 in number, but within four generations they have increased to 600,000 men of fighting age, and the Pharaoh of Egypt, alarmed, first enslaves them and then orders the death of all male Hebrew children. A woman from the tribe of Levi hides her child, places him in a woven basket, and sends him down the [[Nile]] river. He is named Mosheh, or [[Moses]], by the Egyptians who find him. Being a Hebrew baby, they award a Hebrew woman the task of raising him, the mother of Moses volunteers, and the child and his mother are reunited.<ref>Bereshith, Genesis</ref><ref>Shemoth; Exodus 1 and 2</ref>

At the age of forty Moses kills an Egyptian, after he sees him beating a Hebrew to death, and escapes as a fugitive into the Sinai desert, where he is taken in by the Midianites and marries [[Zipporah]], the daughter of the Midianite priest [[Jethro (Bible)|Jethro]]. When he is eighty years old, Moses is tending a herd of sheep in solitude on [[Mount Sinai]] when he sees a desert shrub that is burning but is [[burning bush|not consumed]]. The [[God in Judaism|God of Israel]] calls to Moses from the fire and reveals his name, Yahweh (from the [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] root word 'HWH' meaning to exist), and tells Moses that he is being sent to Pharaoh to bring the people of Israel out of Egypt.<ref>Shemoth; Exodus 3 and 4</ref>

Yahweh tells Moses that if Pharaoh refuses to let the [[Hebrews]] go to say to Pharaoh "Thus says Yahweh: Israel is my son, my first-born and I have said to you: Let my son go, that he may serve me, and you have refused to let him go. Behold, I will slay your son, your first-born". Moses returns to Egypt and tells Pharaoh that he must let the Hebrew slaves go free. Pharaoh refuses and Yahweh strikes the Egyptians with a series of horrific [[Ten plagues of Egypt|plagues, wonders, and catastrophes]], after which Pharaoh relents and banishes the Hebrews from Egypt. Moses [[The Exodus|leads the Israelites out of bondage]]<ref name="andré dollinger">[http://www.reshafim.org.il/ad/egypt/texts/ipuwer.htm English translation of the papyrus. A translation also in R. B. Parkinson, ''The Tale of Sinuhe and Other Ancient Egyptian Poems''. Oxford World's Classics, 1999.]</ref> toward the [[Red Sea]], but Pharaoh changes his mind and arises to massacre the fleeing Hebrews. Pharaoh finds them by the sea shore and attempts to drive them into the ocean with his chariots and drown them.<ref>Shemoth; Exodus 5 through 15</ref>

Yahweh [[Crossing the Red Sea|causes the Red Sea to part]] and the Hebrews pass through on dry land into the Sinai. After the Israelites escape from the midst of the sea, Yahweh causes the ocean to close back in on the pursuing Egyptian army, drowning them to death. In the [[Sinai Desert|desert]] Yahweh feeds them with [[manna]] that accumulates on the ground with the morning dew. They are led by a [[Pillar of Cloud|column of cloud]], which ignites at night and becomes a [[Pillar of Fire (theophany)|pillar of fire]] to illuminate the way, southward through the desert until they come to Mount Sinai. The twelve tribes of Israel encamp around the mountain, and on the third day Mount Sinai begins to smolder, then catches fire, and Yahweh speaks the [[Ten Commandments]] from the midst of the fire to all the Israelites, from the top of the mountain.<ref>Shemoth; Exodus 15, 19, and 20</ref>

Moses ascends [[biblical Mount Sinai]] and fasts for forty days while he writes down the [[Torah]] as Yahweh dictates, beginning with [[Genesis creation narrative|Bereshith]] and the creation of the universe and earth.<ref>Bereshith; Genesis 1</ref><ref>The Hidden Face of God: Science Reveals the Ultimate Truth by [[Gerald Schroeder|Gerald L. Schroeder]] PhD (May 9, 2002)</ref> He is shown the design of the [[Mishkan]] and the [[Ark of the Covenant]], which [[Bezalel]] is given the task of building. Moses descends from the mountain forty days later with the [[Sefer Torah]] he wrote, and with two rectangular [[lapis lazuli]]<ref>Shemoth; Exodus 24</ref> tablets, into which Yahweh had carved the Ten Commandments in [[Paleo-Hebrew alphabet|Paleo–Hebrew]]. In his absence, [[Aaron]] has constructed an image of Yahweh,<ref>Tehillim; Psalms 106, 19–20</ref> depicting him as a young [[Golden Calf]], and has presented it to the Israelites, declaring "Behold O Israel, this is your god who brought you out of the land of Egypt". Moses smashes the two tablets and grinds the golden calf into dust, then throws the dust into a stream of water flowing out of Mount Sinai, and forces the Israelites to drink from it.<ref>Shemoth; Exodus 21 through 32</ref>

[[File:12 Tribes of Israel Map.svg|thumb|upright=1.15|Map of the twelve tribes of Israel (before the move of Dan to the north), based on the [[Book of Joshua#Division of the land .28chapters 13.E2.80.9321.29|Book of Joshua]]]]
Moses ascends Mount Sinai for a second time and Yahweh [[Thirteen Attributes of Mercy|passes before]] him and says: 'Yahweh, Yahweh, a god of compassion, and showing favor, slow to anger, and great in kindness and in truth, who shows kindness to the thousandth generation, forgiving wrongdoing and injustice and wickedness, but will by no means clear the guilty, causing the consequences of the parent's wrongdoing to befall their children, and their children's children, to the third and fourth generation'<ref>Shemoth; Exodus, 34, 6–7</ref> Moses then fasts for another forty days while Yahweh carves the Ten Commandments into a second set of stone tablets. After the tablets are completed, light emanates from the face of Moses for the rest of his life, causing him to wear a veil so he does not frighten people.<ref>Shemoth; Exodus 34</ref>

Moses descends Mount Sinai and the Israelites agree to be the [[Jews as a chosen people|chosen people of Yahweh]] and [[Shomer Shabbat|follow all the laws of the Torah]]. Moses prophesies if they forsake the Torah, Yahweh will [[Babylonian exile|exile]] them for the total number of years they did not observe the [[shmita]].<ref>Wayiqra; Leviticus 26</ref> Bezael constructs the Ark of the Covenant and the Mishkan, where the presence of Yahweh dwells on earth in the [[Holy of Holies]], above the Ark of the Covenant, which houses the Ten Commandments. Moses sends spies to scout out the [[Land of Canaan]], and the Israelites are commanded to go up and conquer the land, but they refuse, due to their fear of warfare and violence. In response, Yahweh condemns the entire generation, including Moses, who is condemned for [[Meribah|striking the rock]] at Meribah, to exile and death in the Sinai desert.<ref>Shemoth; Exodus 35 through 40, Wayiqra; Leviticus, Bamidhbar; Numbers, Devariam; Deuteronomy</ref>

Before Moses dies he gives a speech to the Israelites where he paraphrases [[Deuteronomy|a summary]] of the [[mizwa|mizwoth]] given to them by Yahweh, and recites a prophetic song called the [[Ha'azinu]]. Moses prophesies that if the Israelites disobey the Torah, Yahweh will cause a global [[Bar Kochba Revolt#Immediate consequences and exile|exile]] in addition to the minor one prophesied earlier at Mount Sinai, but at the end of days Yahweh will [[Gathering of Israel|gather them back to Israel from among the nations]] when they turn back to the Torah with zeal.<ref>Devariam; Deuteronomy 28 and 29 and 30</ref> The events of the Israelite exodus and their sojourn in the Sinai are memorialized in the Jewish and Samaritan festivals of [[Passover]] and [[Sukkoth]], and the giving of the Torah in the Jewish celebration of [[Shavuoth]].<ref name="wylen"/><ref>Devariam; Deuteronomy</ref>

Forty years after [[the Exodus]], following the death of the generation of Moses, a new generation, led by [[Joshua]], enters Canaan and takes possession of the land in accordance with the promise made to Abraham by Yahweh. Land is allocated to the tribes by [[Land Lottery|lottery]]. Eventually the Israelites ask for a king, and Yahweh gives them [[Saul]]. [[David]], the youngest (divinely favored) son of [[Jesse]] of [[Bethlehem]] would succeed [[Saul]]. Under David the Israelites establish the [[Kingdom of Israel (united monarchy)|united monarchy]], and under David's son [[Solomon]] they construct the [[Holy Temple in Jerusalem]], using the 400-year-old materials of the Mishkan, where Yahweh continues to tabernacle himself among them. On the death of Solomon and reign of his son, [[Rehoboam]], the kingdom is divided in two.<ref>Yehoshua; Joshua, Shoftim; Judges, Shmuel; Samuel, Melakhim; Kings</ref>

The kings of the northern [[Kingdom of Samaria]] are uniformly bad, permitting the worship of other gods and failing to enforce the worship of Yahweh alone, and so Yahweh eventually allows them to be conquered and dispersed among the peoples of the earth; and strangers rule over their remnant in the northern land. In [[Kingdom of Judah|Judah]] some kings are good and enforce the worship of Yahweh alone, but many are bad and permit other gods, even in the Holy Temple itself, and at length Yahweh allows Judah to fall to her enemies, the people taken into captivity in [[Babylon]], the land left empty and desolate, and the Holy Temple itself destroyed.<ref name="wylen"/><ref>Melakhim; Kings, Divrei HaYamim; Chronicles</ref>

Yet despite these events Yahweh does not forget his people, but sends [[Cyrus the Great|Cyrus, king of Persia]] to deliver them from bondage. The Israelites are allowed to return to Judah and Benjamin, the Holy Temple is rebuilt, the priestly orders restored, and the service of sacrifice resumed. Through the offices of the sage [[Ezra]], Israel is constituted as a holy nation, bound by the Torah and holding itself apart from all other peoples.<ref name="wylen"/><ref>Daniel, Ezra, Nehemiah</ref>

==Genetics==

In 2000, M. Hammer, et al. conducted a study on 1371 men and definitively established that part of the paternal gene pool of Jewish communities in Europe, North Africa and Middle East came from a common Middle East ancestral population.<ref>Hammer MF, Redd AJ, Wood ET, et al. (June 2000). "Jewish and Middle Eastern non-Jewish populations share a common pool of Y-chromosome biallelic haplotypes". Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America. 97 (12): 6769–6774. Bibcode:2000PNAS...97.6769H. doi:10.1073/pnas.100115997. PMC 18733. {{PMID|10801975}}.</ref>
In another study (Nebel) noted; "In comparison with data available from other relevant populations in the region, Jews were found to be much more closely related to groups in the north of the Fertile Crescent (Kurds, Turks, and Armenians) than to their Arab neighbors."<ref>Nebel, Almut; Filon, Dvora; Brinkmann, Bernd; Majumder, Partha P.; Faerman, Marina; Oppenheim, Ariella (November 2001).
