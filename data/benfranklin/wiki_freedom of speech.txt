[[File:EleanorRooseveltHumanRights.png|thumb|[[Eleanor Roosevelt]] and the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] (1949)—Article 19 states that "Everyone has the right to freedom of opinion and expression; this right includes freedom to hold opinions without interference and to seek, receive and impart information and ideas through any media and regardless of frontiers"<ref>[http://www.un.org/en/universal-declaration-human-rights/ Universal Declaration of Human Rights]</ref>]]

'''Freedom of speech''' is a principle that supports the [[freedom]] of an individual or a community to articulate their opinions and ideas without fear of retaliation, [[censorship]], or legal sanction.  The term "'''freedom of expression'''" is sometimes used synonymously but includes any act of seeking, receiving, and imparting information or ideas, regardless of the medium used.

Freedom of expression is recognized as a human right under article 19 of the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] (UDHR) and recognized in [[international human rights law]] in the [[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights]] (ICCPR). Article 19 of the UDHR states that "everyone shall have the right to hold opinions without interference" and "everyone shall have the right to freedom of expression; this right shall include freedom to seek, receive and impart information and ideas of all kinds, regardless of frontiers, either orally, in writing or in print, in the form of art, or through any other media of his choice". The version of Article 19 in the ICCPR later amends this by stating that the exercise of these rights carries "special duties and responsibilities" and may "therefore be subject to certain restrictions" when necessary "[f]or respect of the rights or reputation of others" or "[f]or the protection of national security or of public order (order public), or of public health or morals".<ref>{{cite news |title= Article 19 |url= http://www2.ohchr.org/english/law/ccpr.htm |work= International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights |publisher= Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights; adopted and opened for signature, ratification and accession by UN General Assembly resolution 2200A (XXI) of 16 December 1966, entry into force 23 March 1976 |date=23 March 1976 |accessdate=13 March 2014 |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080705115024/http://www2.ohchr.org/english/law/ccpr.htm |archivedate=5 July 2008 |df=dmy }}</ref>

Freedom of speech and expression, therefore, may not be recognized as being absolute, and common limitations or boundaries to freedom of speech relate to [[libel]], [[slander]], [[obscenity]], [[pornography]], [[sedition]], [[incitement]], [[fighting words]], [[classified information]], [[copyright violation]], [[trade secrets]], [[List of food labeling regulations|food labeling]], [[non-disclosure agreements]], the [[right to privacy]], the [[right to be forgotten]], [[public security]], and [[perjury]]. Justifications for such include the [[harm principle]], proposed by [[John Stuart Mill]] in ''[[On Liberty]]'', which suggests that: "the only purpose for which power can be rightfully exercised over any member of a civilized community, against his will, is to prevent harm to others."<ref name="van Mill">{{Cite book|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/fall2016/entries/freedom-speech/|title=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|last=van Mill|first=David|date=1 January 2016 |editor-last=Zalta|editor-first=Edward N.|edition=Fall 2016}}</ref>

The idea of the "offense principle" is also used in the justification of speech limitations, describing the restriction on forms of expression deemed offensive to society, considering factors such as extent, duration, motives of the speaker, and ease with which it could be avoided.<ref name="van Mill"/> With the evolution of the [[digital age]], application of the freedom of speech becomes more controversial as new means of communication and restrictions arise, for example the [[Golden Shield Project]], an initiative by Chinese government's [[Ministry of Public Security of the People's Republic of China|Ministry of Public Security]] that filters potentially unfavorable data from foreign countries.

== Origins ==
Freedom of speech and expression has a long history that predates modern [[international human rights instruments]].<ref name="guardiantimeline" /> It is thought that ancient [[Athenian democracy|Athenian democratic principle]] of free speech may have emerged in the late 6th or early 5th century BC.<ref>{{cite book |title=Origins of democracy in ancient Greece|first=Kurt|last=Raaflaub|first2=Josiah|last2=Ober|first3=Robert|last3=Wallace|year=2007|publisher=[[University of California Press]]|isbn=0-520-24562-8|page=65|postscript=<!--None-->}}</ref> The values of the [[Roman Republic]] included freedom of speech and [[freedom of religion]].<ref>{{cite journal|journal=The Classical Review|volume=57|issue=1|date=March 1943|page=49|publisher=The Classical Association|url=http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract;jsessionid=9192DF339924E8290F982D7458AFBC06.tomcat1?fromPage=online&aid=4343064|author=M. P. Charlesworth|title=Freedom of Speech in Republican Rome|doi=10.1017/s0009840x00311283}}</ref>

Concepts of freedom of speech can be found in early human rights documents.<ref name="guardiantimeline">{{cite news | url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2006/feb/05/religion.news | work=The Guardian | location=London | title=Timeline: a history of free speech | first=David | last=Smith |date=5 February 2006 |accessdate=2 May 2010}}</ref> The [[Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen]], adopted during the [[French Revolution]] in 1789, specifically affirmed freedom of speech as an inalienable right.<ref name="guardiantimeline" /> The Declaration provides for freedom of expression in Article 11, which states that:

<blockquote>The free communication of ideas and opinions is one of the most precious of the rights of man. Every citizen may, accordingly, speak, write, and print with freedom, but shall be responsible for such abuses of this freedom as shall be defined by law.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.hrcr.org/docs/frenchdec.html|title=Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen|work=Hrcr.org|publisher=www.hrcr.org|accessdate=25 June 2013|author=Arthur W. Diamond Law Library at Columbia Law School|date=26 March 2008}}</ref></blockquote>

Article 19 of the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]], adopted in 1948, states that: <blockquote>Everyone has the right to freedom of opinion and expression; this right includes freedom to hold opinions without interference and to seek, receive and impart information and ideas through any media and regardless of frontiers.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.un.org/en/documents/udhr/ |title=The Universal Declaration of Human Rights|author=[[United Nations]]|work=UN.org|accessdate=25 June 2013|date=10 September 1948|publisher=www.un.org}}</ref></blockquote>

Today, freedom of speech, or the freedom of expression, is recognized in international and regional [[human rights law]]. The right is enshrined in Article 19 of the [[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights]], Article 10 of the [[European Convention on Human Rights]], Article 13 of the [[American Convention on Human Rights]] and Article 9 of the [[African Charter on Human and Peoples' Rights]].<ref name=autogenerated1>Andrew Puddephatt, Freedom of Expression, The essentials of Human Rights, Hodder Arnold, 2005, p. 128</ref> Based on [[John Milton]]'s arguments, freedom of speech is understood as a multi-faceted right that includes not only the right to express, or disseminate, information and ideas, but three further distinct aspects:
# the right to seek information and ideas;
# the right to receive information and ideas;
# the right to impart information and ideas

International, regional and national standards also recognize that freedom of speech, as the freedom of expression, includes any medium, be it orally, in written, in print, through the [[Internet]] or through art forms. This means that the protection of freedom of speech as a right includes not only the content, but also the means of expression.<ref name=autogenerated1 />

=== Relationship to other rights ===
The right to freedom of speech and expression is closely related to other rights, and may be limited when conflicting with other rights (see [[Freedom of speech#Limitations|limitations on freedom of speech]]).<ref name=autogenerated1 /> The right to freedom of expression is also related to the [[right to a fair trial]] and court proceeding which may limit access to the search for information, or determine the opportunity and means in which freedom of expression is manifested within court proceedings.<ref name=Limitstotolerance>{{cite book | last =Brett| first = Sebastian| title = Limits to tolerance: freedom of expression and the public debate in Chile| publisher = Human Rights Watch| year =1999| location =| page = xxv| url = https://books.google.com/?id=KGS_vAYDdtoC&dq=freedom+of+expression+limitations| doi =| id =| isbn =978-1-56432-192-3}}</ref> As a general principle freedom of expression may not limit the [[right to privacy]], as well as the honor and reputation of others. However greater latitude is given when criticism of public figures is involved.<ref name=Limitstotolerance/>

The right to freedom of expression is particularly important for [[News media|media]], which plays a special role as the bearer of the general right to freedom of expression for all.<ref name=autogenerated1 /> However, [[freedom of the press]] does not necessarily enable freedom of speech. Judith Lichtenberg has outlined conditions in which freedom of the press may constrain freedom of speech, for example where the media suppresses information or stifles the diversity of voices inherent in freedom of speech. Lichtenberg argues that [[freedom of the press]] is simply a form of [[property right]] summed up by the principle "no money, no voice".<ref>{{cite book |last= Sanders |first= Karen |title= Ethics & Journalism |publisher= Sage |year= 2003 |page= 68 |url= https://www.google.com/books?id=bnpliIUyO60C&dq=Areopagitica+freedom+of+speech+britain&as_brr=3|isbn= 978-0-7619-6967-9}}</ref>

== Democracy and social interaction ==
[[File:Free Speech Wall.jpg|thumb|Permanent Free Speech Wall in [[Charlottesville, Virginia]], U.S.]]
Freedom of speech is understood to be fundamental in a democracy. The norms on limiting freedom of expression mean that public debate may not be completely suppressed even in times of emergency.<ref name=Limitstotolerance /> One of the most notable proponents of the link between freedom of speech and [[democracy]] is [[Alexander Meiklejohn]]. He has argued that the concept of democracy is that of self-government by the people. For such a system to work, an informed electorate is necessary. In order to be appropriately knowledgeable, there must be no constraints on the free flow of information and ideas. According to Meiklejohn, democracy will not be true to its essential ideal if those in power are able to manipulate the electorate by withholding information and stifling criticism. Meiklejohn acknowledges that the desire to manipulate opinion can stem from the motive of seeking to benefit society. However, he argues, choosing manipulation negates, in its means, the democratic ideal.<ref>{{cite book |title= Propaganda and the Ethics of Persuasion |last=Marlin |first= Randal |authorlink= |year=2002 |publisher= Broadview Press |location= |isbn=978-1551113760 |pages=226–27 |url= https://books.google.com/?id=Zp38Ot2g7LEC&pg=PA226&dq=%22free+speech%22+democracy }}</ref>

[[Eric Barendt]] has called this defense of free speech on the grounds of democracy "probably the most attractive and certainly the most fashionable free speech theory in modern Western democracies".<ref>{{cite book |title=Propaganda and the Ethics of Persuasion |last=Marlin |first=Randal |authorlink= |year=2002 |publisher= Broadview Press |location= |isbn= 978-1551113760 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=Zp38Ot2g7LEC&pg=PA226&dq=%22free+speech%22+democracy |page=226 }}</ref> Thomas I. Emerson expanded on this defense when he argued that freedom of speech helps to provide a balance between stability and [[Social change|change]]. Freedom of speech acts as a "safety valve" to let off steam when people might otherwise be bent on [[revolution]]. He argues that "The principle of open discussion is a method of achieving a more adaptable and at the same time more stable community, of maintaining the precarious balance between healthy cleavage and necessary consensus." Emerson furthermore maintains that "Opposition serves a vital social function in offsetting or ameliorating (the) normal process of bureaucratic decay."<ref>{{cite book |title= Propaganda and the Ethics of Persuasion |last=Marlin |first=Randal |authorlink= |year=2002 |publisher=Broadview Press |location= |isbn= 978-1551113760  |pages=228–29 |url= https://books.google.com/?id=Zp38Ot2g7LEC&pg=PA226&dq=%22free+speech%22+democracy }}</ref>

Research undertaken by the [[Worldwide Governance Indicators]] project at the [[World Bank]], indicates that freedom of speech, and the process of accountability that follows it, have a significant impact in the quality of [[governance]] of a country. "Voice and Accountability" within a country, defined as "the extent to which a country's [[citizen]]s are able to participate in selecting their [[government]], as well as freedom of expression, [[freedom of association]], and [[Freedom of the press|free media]]" is one of the six dimensions of governance that the Worldwide Governance Indicators measure for more than 200 countries.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://info.worldbank.org/governance/wgi2007/pdf/booklet_decade_of_measuring_governance.pdf |title=A Decade of Measuring the Quality of Governance|publisher=World Bank|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080408193105/http://info.worldbank.org/governance/wgi2007/pdf/booklet_decade_of_measuring_governance.pdf|archivedate=8 April 2008}}</ref> Against this backdrop it is important that development agencies create grounds for effective support for a free press in developing countries.<ref>{{cite web|title = Freedom of expression promotes democracy|url =  http://www.dandc.eu/en/article/alexander-matschke-promoting-free-media-task-development-policy|first = Alexander|last = Matschke|date = 25 December 2014|website = D+C Development and Cooperation}}</ref>

Richard Moon has developed the argument that the value of freedom of speech and freedom of expression lies with social interactions. Moon writes that "by communicating an individual forms relationships and associations with others – family, friends, co-workers, church congregation, and countrymen. By entering into discussion with others an individual participates in the development of knowledge and in the direction of the community."<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=Zp38Ot2g7LEC&pg=PA226&dq=%22free+speech%22+democracy|title=Propaganda and the Ethics of Persuasion |last=Marlin |first=Randal |publisher=Broadview Press|year=2002|isbn=978-1551113760|location=|page=229|authorlink=}}</ref>

== Limitations ==

Legal systems sometimes recognize certain limits on or to the freedom of speech, particularly when freedom of speech conflicts with other rights and freedoms, such as in the cases of [[Defamation|libel]], [[Defamation|slander]], [[pornography]], [[obscenity]], [[fighting words]], and [[intellectual property]]. In Europe, blasphemy is a limitation to free speech.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Brennan |first1=David |title=Calling Prophet Muhammad a Pedophile Not Protected by Free Speech, Court Rules |url=https://www.newsweek.com/calling-prophet-muhammad-pedophile-not-protected-free-speech-court-rules-1189031 |accessdate=27 October 2018 |work=Newsweek |date=26 October 2018 |quote=The European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) ruled that calling the Prophet Muhammad a pedophile was not protected by freedom of speech laws.}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last1=Chase Winter |title=Calling Prophet Muhammad a pedophile does not fall within freedom of speech: European court |url=https://www.dw.com/en/calling-prophet-muhammad-a-pedophile-does-not-fall-within-freedom-of-speech-european-court/a-46050749 |accessdate=27 October 2018 |work=Deutsche Welle |date=26 October 2018 |quote=An Austrian woman's conviction for calling the Prophet Muhammad a pedophile did not violate her freedom of speech, the European Court of Human Rights ruled Thursday.}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last1=Lucia I.

[[Censorship of broadcasting in the United States|Limitations to freedom of speech]] may occur through legal sanction or social disapprobation, or both.<ref name="leeds1">{{cite web | title = Freedom of Speech| work = Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy| publisher = | date = 17 April 2008| url = http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/freedom-speech/ | accessdate = 29 May 2011}}</ref> Certain public institutions may also enact policies restricting the freedom of speech, for example [[speech code]]s at [[state school]]s.

In ''[[On Liberty]]'' (1859), [[John Stuart Mill]] argued that "...there ought to exist the fullest liberty of professing and discussing, as a matter of ethical conviction, any doctrine, however immoral it may be considered."<ref name="leeds1" /> Mill argues that the fullest liberty of expression is required to push arguments to their logical limits, rather than the limits of social embarrassment.<ref name="Mill 1859 1-5"/><ref name="Mill 1859 2-19"/><ref name="Ten Cate 2010"/><ref name="Wragg 2015"/>  However, Mill also introduced what is known as the harm principle, in placing the following limitation on free expression: "the only purpose for which power can be rightfully exercised over any member of a civilized community, against his will, is to prevent harm to others."<ref name="leeds1" />

In 1985, [[Joel Feinberg]] introduced what is known as the "offense principle", arguing that Mill's harm principle does not provide sufficient protection against the wrongful behaviors of others. Feinberg wrote "It is always a good reason in support of a proposed criminal prohibition that it would probably be an effective way of preventing serious offense (as opposed to injury or harm) to persons other than the actor, and that it is probably a necessary means to that end."<ref name="ref1">{{cite book|title = The Collapse of the Harm Principle|url = http://scholarlycommons.law.northwestern.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=7037&context=jclc|chapter = Conclusion|author = Harcourt|accessdate = 7 September 2015}}</ref> Hence Feinberg argues that the harm principle sets the bar too high and that some forms of expression can be legitimately prohibited by law because they are very offensive. But, as offending someone is less serious than harming someone, the penalties imposed should be higher for causing harm.<ref name="ref1" /> In contrast, Mill does not support legal penalties unless they are based on the harm principle.<ref name="leeds1" /> Because the degree to which people may take offense varies, or may be the result of unjustified prejudice, Feinberg suggests that a number of factors need to be taken into account when applying the offense principle, including: the extent, duration and social value of the speech, the ease with which it can be avoided, the motives of the speaker, the number of people offended, the intensity of the offense, and the general interest of the community at large.<ref name="leeds1" />

Along similar lines as Mill, Jasper Doomen argued that harm should be defined from the point of view of the individual citizen, not limiting harm to physical harm since nonphysical harm may also be involved; Feinberg's distinction between harm and offense is criticized as largely trivial.<ref>Doomen 2014, pp. 111, 112.</ref>

In 1999, [[Bernard Harcourt]] wrote of the collapse of the harm principle: "Today the debate is characterized by a cacophony of competing harm arguments without any way to resolve them. There is no longer an argument within the structure of the debate to resolve the competing claims of harm. The original harm principle was never equipped to determine the relative importance of harms."<ref>{{cite book|title=Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy|url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/l/law-phil.htm |chapter=Philosophy of Law|author=Kenneth Einar Himma|accessdate=13 March 2014}}</ref>

Interpretations of both the harm and offense limitations to freedom of speech are culturally and politically relative. For instance, in Russia, the harm and offense principles have been used to justify the [[Russian LGBT propaganda law]] restricting speech (and action) in relation to [[LGBT]] issues. A number of European countries that take pride in freedom of speech nevertheless outlaw speech that might be interpreted as [[Holocaust denial#Laws against Holocaust denial|Holocaust denial]]. These include Austria, Belgium, Czech Republic, France, Germany, Hungary, Israel, Liechtenstein, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Netherlands, Poland, Portugal, Slovakia, and Switzerland.<ref>Lechtholz-Zey, Jacqueline: Laws Banning Holocaust Denial.

In the U.S., the standing landmark opinion on political speech is ''[[Brandenburg v. Ohio]]'' (1969),<ref>''[[Brandenburg v. Ohio]]'', {{ussc|395|444|1969}}</ref> expressly overruling ''Whitney v. California''.{{sfn|Jasper|1999|p=32}} In ''Brandenburg'', the [[United States Supreme Court|US Supreme Court]] referred to the right even to speak openly of violent action and revolution in broad terms:{{quote|[Our] decisions have fashioned the principle that the constitutional guarantees of free speech and free press do not allow a State to forbid or proscribe advocacy of the use of force or law violation except where such advocacy is directed to inciting or producing [[imminent lawless action]] and is likely to incite or cause such action.<ref>''Brandenburg'', at 447</ref>}} The opinion in ''Brandenburg'' discarded the previous test of "clear and present danger" and made the right to freedom of (political) speech's protections in the United States almost absolute.<ref>''Brandenburg'', at 450–01</ref>{{sfn|Lewis|2007|p=124}} Hate speech is also protected by the First Amendment in the United States, as decided in ''[[R.A.V. v.

Jo Glanville, editor of the ''[[Index on Censorship]]'', states that "the Internet has been a revolution for [[censorship]] as much as for free speech".<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/nov/17/censorship-internet |title=The big business of net censorship |last=Glanville  |first=Jo |date=17 November 2008 |work= The Guardian | location=London|accessdate=26 March 2014}}</ref> International, national and regional standards recognise that freedom of speech, as one form of freedom of expression, applies to any medium, including the [[Internet]].<ref name=autogenerated1 /> The [[Communications Decency Act]] (CDA) of 1996 was the first major attempt by the [[United States Congress]] to regulate [[pornography|pornographic]] material on the Internet. In 1997, in the landmark [[cyberlaw]] case of ''[[Reno v. ACLU]]'', the [[United States Supreme Court|US Supreme Court]] partially overturned the law.<ref>{{cite book | last = Godwin | first = Mike | authorlink =Mike Godwin  | year = 2003 | title = [[Cyber Rights: Defending Free Speech in the Digital Age]] | publisher = MIT Press| isbn = 0-262-57168-4|pages=349–52}}</ref> Judge [[Stewart R.

<blockquote>The Internet is a far more speech-enhancing medium than [[Print media|print]], the [[village green]], or the [[mail]]s. Because it would necessarily affect the Internet itself, the CDA would necessarily reduce the speech available for adults on the medium. This is a constitutionally intolerable result. Some of the dialogue on the Internet surely tests the limits of conventional discourse. Speech on the Internet can be unfiltered, unpolished, and unconventional, even emotionally charged, sexually explicit, and vulgar – in a word, "indecent" in many communities. But we should expect such speech to occur in a medium in which citizens from all walks of life have a voice. We should also protect the autonomy that such a medium confers to ordinary people as well as media magnates.[...] My analysis does not deprive the Government of all means of protecting children from the dangers of Internet communication. The Government can continue to protect children from pornography on the Internet through vigorous enforcement of existing laws criminalizing obscenity and child pornography. [...] As we learned at the hearing, there is also a compelling need for public educations about the benefits and dangers of this new medium, and the Government can fill that role as well. In my view, our action today should only mean that Government's permissible supervision of Internet contents stops at the traditional line of unprotected speech. [...] The absence of governmental regulation of Internet content has unquestionably produced a kind of chaos, but as one of the plaintiff's experts put it with such resonance at the hearing: "What achieved success was the very chaos that the Internet is. The strength of the Internet is chaos." Just as the strength of the Internet is chaos, so that strength of our liberty depends upon the chaos and cacophony of the unfettered speech the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] protects.<ref name="rowland" /></blockquote>

The [[World Summit on the Information Society]] (WSIS) Declaration of Principles adopted in 2003 makes specific reference to the importance of the right to freedom of expression for the "[[Information society|Information Society]]" in stating:

<blockquote>We reaffirm, as an essential foundation of the Information society, and as outlined in Article 19 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, that everyone has the right to freedom of opinion and expression; that this right includes freedom to hold opinions without interference and to seek, receive and impart information and ideas through any media and regardless of frontiers. Communication is a fundamental social process, a basic human need and the foundation of all social organisation. It is central to the [[Information society|Information Society]].

According to Bernt Hugenholtz and Lucie Guibault the [[public domain]] is under pressure from the "[[commodification]] of information" as information with previously little or no economic value has acquired independent economic value in the information age. This includes factual data, [[personal data]], [[genetic information]] and pure [[idea]]s. The commodification of information is taking place through [[intellectual property]] law, [[contract law]], as well as broadcasting and telecommunications law.<ref>{{cite book | last = Guibault| first = Lucy|last2=Hugenholtz |first2=Bernt| title = The future of the public domain: identifying the commons in information law| publisher = Kluwer Law International| year = 2006| page = 1| url = https://www.google.com/books?id=KJmNGglq0nwC&dq=public+domain&as_brr=3| isbn = 9789041124357}}</ref>

=== Freedom of information ===
{{Main|Freedom of information}}
Freedom of information is an extension of freedom of speech where the medium of expression is the [[Internet]]. Freedom of information may also refer to the [[right to privacy]] in the context of the Internet and [[information technology]]. As with the right to freedom of expression, the right to privacy is a recognised [[human right]] and freedom of information acts as an extension to this right.<ref name=autogenerated2>{{cite magazine |url = http://freenetproject.org/papers/freenet-ieee.pdf |title = Protecting Free Expression Online with Freenet |magazine = Internet Computing|publisher =  IEEE|last1 = Clarke |first1 = Ian|last2 = Miller|first2 = Scott G.|last3= Hong|first3 = Theodore W.|last4 = Sandberg|first4= Oskar|last5 = Wiley|first5 = Brandon|date = 2002|pages =40–49}}</ref> Freedom of information may also concern [[censorship]] in an information technology context, i.e. the ability to access [[Web content]], without censorship or restrictions.<ref>{{cite news|last=Pauli|first=Darren|date=14 January 2008|url=http://www.thestandard.com/news/2008/01/14/industry-rejects-australian-govt-sanitized-internet-measure|title=Industry rejects Australian gov't sanitized Internet measure|work=[[The Industry Standard]]|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120912112920/http://www.thestandard.com/news/2008/01/14/industry-rejects-australian-govt-sanitized-internet-measure|archivedate=12 September 2012|df=dmy-all}}</ref>

{{Main |Internet censorship |Internet censorship by country}}
The concept of [[freedom of information]] has emerged in response to state sponsored censorship, monitoring and surveillance of the internet.

A widely publicized example of internet censorship is the "[[Great Firewall of China]]" (in reference both to its role as a [[firewall (networking)|network firewall]] and to the ancient [[Great Wall of China]]). The system blocks content by preventing [[IP address]]es from being routed through and consists of standard firewall and [[proxy server]]s at the [[Internet]] [[gateway (telecommunications)|gateways]]. The system also selectively engages in [[DNS poisoning]] when particular sites are requested. The government does not appear to be systematically examining Internet content, as this appears to be technically impractical.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/china/story/0,,1713317,00.html|author=Watts, Jonathan |date=20 February 2006 |title=War of the words |publisher=[[The Guardian]] | location=London}}</ref> [[Internet censorship in the People's Republic of China]] is conducted under a wide variety of laws and administrative regulations, including more than sixty regulations directed at the Internet.

Before the invention of the [[printing press]] a written work, once created, could only be physically multiplied by highly laborious and error-prone manual copying. No elaborate system of censorship and control over [[scribes]] existed, who until the 14th century were restricted to religious institutions, and their works rarely caused wider controversy. In response to the [[printing press]], and the ''[[heresies]]'' it allowed to spread, the [[Roman Catholic Church]] moved to impose censorship.<ref name="de Sola Pool 1983 14">{{Cite book | last = de Sola Pool| first = Ithiel | title = Technologies of freedom| publisher = Harvard University Press| year = 1983 | page = 14 | url = https://www.google.com/books?id=BzLXGUxV4CkC&pg=PA14&dq=%22Censorship+and+Control%22#v=onepage| isbn = 978-0-674-87233-2}}</ref> Printing allowed for multiple exact copies of a work, leading to a more rapid and widespread circulation of ideas and information (see [[print culture]]).<ref name="MacQueen 2007 34">{{Cite book | last = MacQueen | first = Hector L |last2=Waelde |first2=Charlotte |last3=Laurie |first3=Graeme T | title = Contemporary Intellectual Property: Law and Policy | publisher = Oxford University Press | year = 2007 | page = 34 | url = https://www.google.com/books?id=_Iwcn4pT0OoC&dq=contemporary+intellectual+property | isbn = 978-0-19-926339-4}}</ref> The origins of [[copyright law]] in most European countries lie in efforts by the Roman Catholic Church and governments to regulate and control the output of printers.<ref name="MacQueen 2007 34" />

In 1501 [[Pope Alexander VI]] issued a Bill against the unlicensed printing of books and in 1559 the [[Index Expurgatorius]], or ''List of Prohibited Books'', was issued for the first time.<ref name="de Sola Pool 1983 14" /> The Index Expurgatorius is the most famous and long lasting example of "bad books" catalogues issued by the Roman Catholic Church, which presumed to be in authority over private thoughts and opinions, and suppressed views that went against its doctrines. The Index Expurgatorius was administered by the [[Roman Inquisition]], but enforced by local government authorities, and went through 300 editions. Amongst others, it banned or [[censored]] books written by [[René Descartes]], [[Giordano Bruno]], [[Galileo Galilei]], [[David Hume]], [[John Locke]], [[Daniel Defoe]], [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]] and [[Voltaire]].<ref>{{cite book | last = Castillo| first = Anastasia| title = Banned Books: Censorship in Eighteenth-Century England| publisher = GRIN Verlag| year = 2010| page = 12| url = https://books.google.com/?id=CqaAGfL-IQIC&dq=Giordano+Bruno+censorship| isbn = 978-3-640-71688-3}}</ref> While governments and church encouraged printing in many ways because it allowed for the dissemination of [[Bible]]s and government information, works of dissent and criticism could also circulate rapidly.

Milton's defense of freedom of expression was grounded in a [[Protestantism|Protestant]] worldview and he thought that the English people had the mission to work out the truth of the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]], which would lead to the [[Age of Enlightenment|enlightenment]] of all people. But Milton also articulated the main strands of future discussions about freedom of expression. By defining the scope of freedom of expression and of "harmful" speech Milton argued against the principle of pre-censorship and in favor of tolerance for a wide range of views.<ref name="Sanders 2003 66" /> Freedom of the press ceased being regulated in England in 1695 when the Licensing Order of 1643 was allowed to expire after the introduction of the [[Bill of Rights 1689]] shortly after the Glorious Revolution.<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/journalists/gordon-rayner/8812486/Leveson-Inquiry-British-press-freedom-is-a-model-for-the-world-editor-tells-inquiry.html | title=Leveson Inquiry: British press freedom is a model for the world, editor tells inquiry | publisher=Telegraph Media Group Limited | work=The Telegraph | date=7 October 2011 | accessdate=9 May 2018 | author=Rayner, Gordon | quote=Mr Rusbridger said: “When people talk about licensing journalists or newspapers the instinct should be to refer them to history.

The last time this happened was under the Licensing Order of 1643, which was allowed to expire in 1695 after the introduction of the 1688 Bill of Rights shortly after the Glorious Revolution.

In 1557 the [[British Crown]] thought to stem the flow of seditious and heretical books by chartering the [[Stationers' Company]]. The right to print was limited to the members of that guild, and thirty years later the [[Star Chamber]] was chartered to curtail the "greate enormities and abuses" of "dyvers contentyous and disorderlye persons professinge the arte or mystere of pryntinge or selling of books." The right to print was restricted to two universities and to the 21 existing printers in the [[city of London]], which had 53 [[printing presses]]. As the British crown took control of type founding in 1637 printers fled to the [[Netherlands]]. Confrontation with authority made printers radical and rebellious, with 800 authors, printers and book dealers being incarcerated in the [[Bastille]] in Paris before it was stormed in 1789.<ref name="de Sola Pool 1983 15" />

A succession of English thinkers was at the forefront of early discussion on a right to freedom of expression, among them [[John Milton]] (1608–74) and [[John Locke]] (1632–1704). Locke established the [[individual]] as the unit of value and the bearer of rights to [[right to life|life]], [[right to liberty|liberty]], [[right to property|property]] and the [[pursuit of happiness]]. However Locke's ideas evolved primarily around the concept of the right to seek salvation for one's soul, and was thus primarily concerned with theological matters. Locke neither supported a universal toleration of peoples nor freedom of speech; according to his ideas, some groups, such as atheists, should not be allowed.<ref name="jonathanisrael">{{cite book|author=Jonathan Israel|title=Radical Enlightenment|publisher=Oxford University Press|year= 2002|pages= 265–67}}</ref>

[[John Stuart Mill]] (1806–1873) argued that without human freedom there can be no progress in science, law or politics, which according to Mill required free discussion of opinion. Mill's ''[[On Liberty]]'', published in 1859 became a classic defence of the right to freedom of expression.<ref name="Sanders 2003 66" /> Mill argued that [[truth]] drives out falsity, therefore the free expression of ideas, true or false, should not be feared. Truth is not stable or fixed, but evolves with time. Mill argued that much of what we once considered true has turned out false. Therefore, views should not be prohibited for their apparent falsity. Mill also argued that free discussion is necessary to prevent the "deep slumber of a decided opinion". Discussion would drive the onwards march of truth and by considering false views the basis of true views could be re-affirmed.<ref>{{cite book | last = Sanders| first = Karen| title = Ethics & Journalism| publisher = Sage| year = 2003| page = 67| url = https://www.google.com/books?id=bnpliIUyO60C&dq=Areopagitica+freedom+of+speech+britain&as_brr=3| isbn = 978-0-7619-6967-9}}</ref> Furthermore, Mill argued that an opinion only carries intrinsic value to the owner of that opinion, thus silencing the expression of that opinion is an injustice to a basic human right. For Mill, the only instance in which speech can be justifiably suppressed is in order to prevent harm from a clear and direct threat. Neither economic or moral implications, nor the speakers own well-being would justify suppression of speech.<ref>{{cite book | last = Warburton| first = Nigel| title = Free Speech: A Very Short Introduction| publisher = Oxford| year = 2009| pages = 24–29| url = https://books.google.com/?id=nJ0uf50ZtzsC&printsec=frontcover| isbn = 978-0-19-923235-2}}</ref>

However, critics argue that society should be concerned by those who directly deny or advocate, for example, [[genocide]] (see limitations above).<ref>{{cite book|first=Lee C.|last =  Bollinger|title=The Tolerant Society: Freedom of Speech and Extremist Speech in America|publisher=Oxford University Press|location= |year= 1986|isbn = 0195040007}}</ref>

The 1928 novel ''[[Lady Chatterley's Lover]]'' by [[D. H. Lawrence]] was banned for [[obscenity]] in a number of countries, including the United Kingdom, the United States, Australia and Canada. In the late 1950s and early 1960s, it was the subject of landmark court rulings which saw the ban for obscenity overturned. Dominic Sandbrook of ''[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]]'' in the UK wrote, "Now that public obscenity has become commonplace, it is hard to recapture the atmosphere of a society that saw fit to ban books such as ''Lady Chatterley’s Lover'' because it was likely to “deprave and corrupt” its readers."<ref>{{cite web |url= https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/books/8066784/Lady-Chatterley-trial-50-years-on.-The-filthy-book-that-set-us-free-and-fettered-us-forever.html |title= Lady Chatterley trial - 50 years on.

Although only half a century separates us from Harold Macmillan’s Britain, the world of 1960 can easily seem like ancient history. In a Britain when men still wore heavy grey suits, working women were still relatively rare and the Empire was still, just, a going concern, D H Lawrence’s book was merely one of many banned because of its threat to public morality.}}</ref> Fred Kaplan of ''[[The New York Times]]'' stated the overturning of the obscenity laws "set off an explosion of free speech" in the US.<ref>{{cite web | url= https://www.nytimes.com/2009/07/21/opinion/21kaplan.html |title= The Day Obscenity Became Art |work= The New York Times |date=July 20, 2009 |accessdate=May 9, 2018 |author= Kaplan, Fred |quote=TODAY is the 50th anniversary of the court ruling that overturned America’s obscenity laws, setting off an explosion of free speech — and also, in retrospect, splashing cold water on the idea, much discussed during Sonia Sotomayor’s Supreme Court confirmation hearings, that judges are “umpires” rather than agents of social change.}}</ref>
