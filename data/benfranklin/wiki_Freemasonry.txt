{{Freemasonry}}

'''Freemasonry''' or '''Masonry''' consists of [[Fraternity|fraternal organisations]] that trace their origins to the local fraternities of [[Stonemasonry|stonemasons]], which from the end of the fourteenth century regulated the qualifications of stonemasons and their interaction with authorities and clients. The degrees of Freemasonry retain the three grades of medieval craft [[guild]]s, those of [[Apprenticeship|Apprentice]], [[Journeyman]] or fellow (now called Fellowcraft), and [[Master craftsman|Master Mason]]. The candidate of these three degrees is progressively taught the meanings of the symbols of Freemasonry, and entrusted with grips, signs and words to signify to other members that he has been so initiated. The initiations are part allegorical [[morality play]] and part lecture. The three degrees are offered by Craft (or Blue Lodge) Freemasonry. Members of these organisations are known as '''Freemasons''' or '''Masons'''. There are additional degrees, which vary with locality and jurisdiction, and are usually administered by their own bodies (separate from those who administer the craft degrees).

The basic, local organisational unit of Freemasonry is the [[Masonic Lodge|Lodge]]. The Lodges are usually supervised and governed at the regional level (usually coterminous with either a state, province, or national border) by a [[Grand Lodge]] or Grand Orient. There is no international, worldwide Grand Lodge that supervises all of Freemasonry; each Grand Lodge is independent, and they do not necessarily recognise each other as being legitimate.

Modern Freemasonry broadly consists of two main recognition groups. [[Regular Freemasonry]] insists that a volume of scripture is open in a working lodge, that every member profess belief in a [[Supreme Being]], that no women are admitted (although, in some jurisdictions, those who transition to women after being initiated may stay; see below), and that the discussion of religion and politics is banned. [[Continental Freemasonry]] is now the general term for the jurisdictions which have removed some, or all, of these restrictions.

{{Main|Masonic Lodge}}
The [[Masonic Lodge]] is the basic organisational unit of Freemasonry.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.chevalierramsay.be/what-is-freemasonry/|title=What is Freemasonry|website=www.chevalierramsay.be|access-date=14 June 2017}}</ref> The Lodge meets regularly to conduct the usual formal business of any small organisation (pay bills, organise social and charitable events, elect new members, etc.). In addition to business, the meeting may perform a ceremony to confer a [[Masonic ritual and symbolism|Masonic degree]]<ref name="UGLEFAQ">[http://www.ugle.org.uk/what-is-freemasonry/frequently-asked-questions "Frequently Asked Questions"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131022154544/http://ugle.org.uk/what-is-freemasonry/frequently-asked-questions |date=22 October 2013 }} ''United Grand Lodge of England'' retrieved 30 October 2013</ref> or receive a lecture, which is usually on some aspect of Masonic history or ritual.<ref>[http://www.pglel.co.uk/Education&Development/materials/MasonicLecturersAndTopics.asp "Materials: Papers and Speakers"] ''Provincial Grand Lodge of East Lancashire'', retrieved 30 October 2013</ref> At the conclusion of the meeting, the Lodge might adjourn for a formal dinner, or ''festive board'', sometimes involving toasting and song.<ref>[http://freemasonry.bcy.ca/texts/toasts.html "Gentlemen, please be upstanding"] Toasts for the festive board, ''Grand Lodge of British Columbia and Yukon'' retrieved 30 October 2013</ref>

The bulk of [[Masonic ritual]] consists of degree ceremonies. Candidates for Freemasonry are progressively ''initiated'' into Freemasonry, first in the degree of Entered Apprentice. Some time later, in a separate ceremony, they will be ''passed'' to the degree of Fellowcraft, and finally they will be ''raised'' to the degree of Master Mason. In all of these ceremonies, the candidate is entrusted with passwords, signs and grips ([[secret handshakes]]) peculiar to his new rank.<ref>[http://www.sacred-texts.com/mas/syma/syma22.htm "Words, Grips and Signs"] H. L. Haywood, ''Symbolical Masonry'', 1923, Chapter XVIII, ''Sacred Texts'' website, retrieved 9 January 2014</ref> Another ceremony is the annual installation of the Master and officers of the Lodge.<ref name="UGLEFAQ"/> In some jurisdictions ''Installed Master'' is valued as a separate rank, with its own secrets to distinguish its members.<ref>[http://www.masonicdictionary.com/past.html "Past Master"] ''Masonic Dictionary'', retrieved 31 October 2013</ref> In other jurisdictions, the grade is not recognised, and no inner ceremony conveys new secrets during the installation of a new Master of the Lodge.<ref>[http://www.gadlu.info/macon-celebre-le-maitre-installe.html "Maçon célèbre : le Maître Installé"] ''GADLU blog Maçonnique'', 3 March 2013, retrieved 2 November 2013</ref>

Most Lodges have some sort of social calendar, allowing Masons and their partners to meet in a less ritualised environment.<ref>For instance [http://www.pglherts.org/about-freemasonry/introduction/ "Introduction into Freemasonry"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131109023055/http://www.pglherts.org/about-freemasonry/introduction/ |date=9 November 2013 }}, ''Provincial Grand Lodge of Hertfordshire'', retrieved 8 November 2013</ref> Often coupled with these events is the obligation placed on every Mason to contribute to charity. This occurs at both Lodge and Grand Lodge level. Masonic charities contribute to many fields, such as education or disaster relief.<ref>[http://www.ugle.org.uk/charity "Charitable work"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131022081813/http://www.ugle.org.uk/charity |date=22 October 2013 }}, ''UGLE'', retrieved 8 November 2013</ref><ref>(editors) John Hamill and Robert Gilbert, ''Freemasonry'', Angus, 2004, pp 214–220</ref>

These private local Lodges form the backbone of Freemasonry, and a Freemason will necessarily have been initiated into one of these. There also exist specialist Lodges where Masons meet to celebrate events, such as sport or Masonic research. The rank of Master Mason also entitles a Freemason to explore Masonry further through other degrees, administered separately from the Craft, or "Blue Lodge" degrees described here, but having a similar format to their meetings.<ref name="Johnstone">Michael Johnstone, ''The Freemasons'', Arcturus, 2005, pp 101–120</ref>

There is very little consistency in Freemasonry. Because each Masonic jurisdiction is independent, each sets its own procedures. The wording of the ritual, the number of officers present, the layout of the meeting room, etc. varies from jurisdiction to jurisdiction.<ref name="Johnstone"/><ref name="Maconnieke">[http://www.vrijmetselaarsgilde.eu/Maconnieke%20Encyclopedie/RMAP~1/Russmixte/officiers.htm "Les Officiers de Loge"] ''Maconnieke Encyclopedie'', retrieved 31 October 2013</ref>

The [[Masonic Lodge Officers|officers of the Lodge]] are elected or appointed annually. Every Masonic Lodge has a Master, two Wardens, a secretary and a treasurer. There is also a [[Tyler (Masonic)|Tyler]], or outer guard, who is always present outside the door of a working Lodge. Other offices vary between jurisdictions.<ref name="Johnstone" />

Each Masonic Lodge exists and operates according to a set of ancient principles known as the ''Landmarks of Freemasonry''. These principles have thus far eluded any universally accepted definition.<ref>[http://www.freemasons-freemasonry.com/bernheim27.html Alain Bernheim, "My Approach to Masonic History"], ''Pietre Stones'', from address of 2011, retrieved 8 November 2013</ref>

===Joining a lodge===
[[File:Washington Masonic print.jpg|thumb|alt=Worshipful Master George Washington|Print from 1870 portraying [[George Washington]] as Master of his Lodge]]

Candidates for Freemasonry will have met most active members of the Lodge they are joining before they are initiated. The process varies between jurisdictions, but the candidate will typically have been introduced by a friend at a Lodge social function, or at some form of open evening in the Lodge. In modern times, interested people often track down a local Lodge through the Internet. The onus is on candidates to ask to join; while candidates may be encouraged to ask, they are never invited. Once the initial inquiry is made, an interview usually follows to determine the candidate's suitability. If the candidate decides to proceed from here, the Lodge ballots on the application before he (or she, depending on the Masonic Jurisdiction) can be accepted.<ref name="MLoE">[http://www.masonic-lodge-of-education.com/become-a-free-mason.html "How to become a Freemason"], ''Masonic Lodge of Education'', retrieved 20 November 2013</ref>

The absolute minimum requirement of any body of Freemasons is that the candidate must be free, and considered to be of good character.<ref>[http://grande-loge.lu/?page_id=223 "Comment devenir franc-maçon?"], Grande Loge de Luxembourg, retrieved 23 November 2013</ref> There is usually an age requirement, varying greatly between Grand Lodges, and (in some jurisdictions) capable of being overridden by a dispensation from the Grand Lodge. The underlying assumption is that the candidate should be a mature adult.<ref name="MLoE"/>

Additionally, most Grand Lodges require the candidate to declare a belief in a [[Supreme Being]]. In a few cases, the candidate may be required to be of a specific religion. The form of Freemasonry most common in Scandinavia (known as the [[Swedish Rite]]), for example, accepts only Christians.<ref>[http://freemasonry.bcy.ca/texts/swedish_faq.html "Swedish Rite FAQ"], ''Grand Lodge of British Columbia & Yukon'', Accessed 19 November 2013</ref> At the other end of the spectrum, "Liberal" or [[Continental Freemasonry]], exemplified by the [[Grand Orient de France]], does not require a declaration of belief in any deity, and accepts atheists (a cause of discord with the rest of Freemasonry).<ref>[http://www.godf.org/index.php/pages/details/slug/foire-aux-questions "Faut-il croire en Dieu?"], Foire aux Questions, ''Grand Orient de France'', Retrieved 23 November 2013</ref><ref name="Buta">[http://www.freemasons-freemasonry.com/masonic_foreign_recognitions.html Jack Buta, "The God Conspiracy, The Politics of Grand Lodge Foreign Relations"], ''Pietre-Stones'', retrieved 23 November 2013</ref>

During the ceremony of initiation, the candidate is expected to swear (usually on a volume of sacred text appropriate to his personal religious faith) to fulfil certain obligations as a Mason. In the course of three degrees, new masons will promise to keep the secrets of their degree from lower degrees and outsiders, and to support a fellow Mason in distress (as far as practicality and the law permit).<ref name="Johnstone"/> There is instruction as to the duties of a Freemason, but on the whole, Freemasons are left to explore the craft in the manner they find most satisfying. Some will further explore the ritual and symbolism of the craft, others will focus their involvement on the social side of the Lodge, while still others will concentrate on the charitable functions of the lodge.<ref>[http://www.hampshirefreemasonry.com/social-events-and-activities "Social events and activities"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140109021223/http://www.hampshirefreemasonry.com/social-events-and-activities |date=9 January 2014 }}, ''Hampshire Province'', retrieved 20 November 2013</ref><ref>[http://www.masonic-lodges.com/masons.html "Who are Masons, and what do they do?"], ''MasonicLodges.com'', retrieved 20 November 2013</ref>

{{Main|Grand Lodge}}
Grand Lodges and Grand Orients are independent and sovereign bodies that govern Masonry in a given country, state, or geographical area (termed a ''jurisdiction''). There is no single overarching governing body that presides over worldwide Freemasonry; connections between different jurisdictions depend solely on mutual recognition.<ref>(editors) John Hamill and Robert Gilbert, ''Freemasonry'', Angus, 2004, Glossary, p247</ref><ref>[http://mastermason.com/rfire/masonry/difficult.html#conspiracy "Difficult Questions; Is Freemasonry a Global Conspiracy?"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150603033856/http://mastermason.com/rfire/masonry/difficult.html |date=3 June 2015 }} ''MasterMason.com'', retrieved 18 November 2013</ref>

Freemasonry, as it exists in various forms all over the world, has a membership estimated by the [[United Grand Lodge of England]] at around 6 million worldwide.<ref name="UGLEFAQ" /> The fraternity is administratively organis<!-- NOTE: THIS ARTICLE USES UK SPELLING ... which spells this word with an "s" and not a "z". -->ed into independent [[Grand Lodge]]s (or sometimes Grand Orients), each of which governs its own Masonic jurisdiction, which consists of subordinate (or ''constituent'') Lodges. The largest single jurisdiction, in terms of membership, is the [[United Grand Lodge of England]] (with a membership estimated at around a quarter million). The [[Grand Lodge of Scotland]] and [[Grand Lodge of Ireland]] (taken together) have approximately 150,000 members.<ref name="UGLEFAQ"/> In the United States, total membership is just under 2 million.<ref>Hodapp, Christopher. ''Freemasons for Dummies''. Indianapolis: Wiley, 2005. p. 52.</ref>

===Recognition, amity and regularity===
Relations between Grand Lodges are determined by the concept of ''Recognition''. Each Grand Lodge maintains a list of other Grand Lodges that it recognises.<ref>{{Cite book

}}</ref> When two Grand Lodges recognise and are in Masonic communication with each other, they are said to be ''[[wikt:amity|in amity]]'', and the brethren of each may visit each other's Lodges and interact Masonically. When two Grand Lodges are not in amity, inter-visitation is not allowed. There are many reasons one Grand Lodge will withhold or withdraw recognition from another, but the two most common are ''Exclusive Jurisdiction'' and ''Regularity''.<ref>[http://www.pilarlodge3freemasonry.freeservers.com/about_1.html Jim Bantolo, "On Recognition"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080314135120/http://www.pilarlodge3freemasonry.freeservers.com/about_1.html |date=14 March 2008 }}, Masonic Short Talk, ''Pilar lodge'', 2007, retrieved 25 November 2013</ref>

====Exclusive Jurisdiction====
Exclusive Jurisdiction is a concept whereby only one Grand Lodge will be recognised in any geographical area. If two Grand Lodges claim jurisdiction over the same area, the other Grand Lodges will have to choose between them, and they may not all decide to recognise the same one. (In 1849, for example, the Grand Lodge of New York split into two rival factions, each claiming to be the legitimate Grand Lodge. Other Grand Lodges had to choose between them until the schism was healed.<ref>[http://www.themasonictrowel.com/ebooks/fm_freemasonry/Lang_-_History_Of_Freemasonry_in_NewYork_1922_raw.pdf Ossian Lang, "History of Freemasonry in the State of New York" (pdf)], 1922, pp135-140, ''Masonic Trowel eBooks''</ref>) Exclusive Jurisdiction can be waived when the two overlapping Grand Lodges are themselves in Amity and agree to share jurisdiction (for example, since the Grand Lodge of Connecticut is in Amity with the Prince Hall Grand Lodge of Connecticut, the principle of Exclusive Jurisdiction does not apply, and other Grand Lodges may recognise both).<ref>[http://www.bessel.org/exclartl.htm "Exclusive Jurisdiction"], ''Paul M. Bessel'', 1998, retrieved 25 November 2013</ref>

====Regularity====
[[File:Microcosm of London Plate 038 - Freemasons' Hall (tone).jpg|thumb|alt=First Freemason's Hall, 1809|Freemasons' Hall, London, c. 1809]]
{{Main|Regular Masonic jurisdictions}}
Regularity is a concept based on adherence to [[Masonic Landmarks]], the basic membership requirements, tenets and rituals of the craft. Each Grand Lodge sets its own definition of what these landmarks are, and thus what is Regular and what is Irregular (and the definitions do not necessarily agree between Grand Lodges). Essentially, every Grand Lodge will hold that ''its'' landmarks (its requirements, tenets and rituals) are Regular, and judge other Grand Lodges based on those. If the differences are significant, one Grand Lodge may declare the other "Irregular" and withdraw or withhold recognition.<ref>[http://www.masonicum.lv/index.php?p=8857&lang=1506&pp=13574 "Regularity in Freemasonry and its Meaning"], ''Grand Lodge of Latvia'', retrieved 25 November 2013</ref><ref>[http://www.freemasons-freemasonry.com/pope4.html Tony Pope, "Regularity and Recognition"], from ''Freemasonry Universal'', by Kent Henderson & Tony Pope, 1998, ''Pietre Stones'' website, retrieved 25 November 2013</ref>

The most commonly shared rules for Recognition (based on Regularity) are those given by the United Grand Lodge of England in 1929:
* The Grand Lodge should be established by an existing regular Grand Lodge, or by at least three regular Lodges.
* A belief in a supreme being and scripture is a condition of membership.
* Initiates should take their vows on that scripture.
* Only men can be admitted, and no relationship exists with mixed Lodges.
* The Grand Lodge has complete control over the first three degrees, and is not subject to another body.
* All Lodges shall display a volume of scripture with the square and compasses while in session.
* There is no discussion of politics or religion.
* "Antient landmarks, customs and usages" observed.<ref>''UGLE Book of Constitutions'', "Basic Principles for Grand Lodge Recognition", any year since 1930, page numbers may vary.</ref>

==Other degrees, orders and bodies==
{{See also|Masonic bodies|List of Masonic Rites}}
Blue Lodge Freemasonry offers only three traditional degrees, and in most jurisdictions, the rank of past or installed master. Master Masons are also able to extend their Masonic experience by taking further degrees, in appendant bodies approved by their own Grand Lodge.<ref>Robert L.D. Cooper, ''Cracking the Freemason's Code'', Rider 2006, p229</ref>

The Ancient and Accepted [[Scottish Rite]] is a system of 33 degrees (including the three Blue Lodge degrees) administered by a local or national Supreme Council. This system is popular in North America and in Continental Europe. The [[York Rite]], with a similar range, administers three orders of Masonry, namely the [[Royal Arch Masonry|Royal Arch]], [[Cryptic Masonry]], and [[Knights Templar (Freemasonry)|Knights Templar]].<ref>Michael Johnstone, ''The Freemasons'', Arcturus, 2005, pp 95–98</ref>

In Britain, separate bodies administer each order. Freemasons are encouraged to join the [[Holy Royal Arch]], which is linked to [[Order of Mark Master Masons|Mark Masonry]] in Scotland and Ireland, but separate in England. Templar and Cryptic Masonry also exist.<ref>[http://www.freemasons-freemasonry.com/ward_HD_handbookfr.html J S M Ward, "The Higher Degrees Handbook"], ''Pietre Stones'', retrieved 11 November 2013</ref>

In the [[Nordic countries]], the [[Swedish Rite]] is dominant; a variation of it is also used in parts of [[Germany]].

==Ritual and symbolism==
{{Main|Masonic ritual and symbolism}}
Freemasonry describes itself as a "'beautiful system of morality, veiled in allegory and illustrated by symbols".<ref>[http://www.mhebf.com/freemasonry.html "What is Freemasonry?"] ''Grand Lodge of Alberta'' retrieved 7 November 2013</ref> The symbolism is mainly, but not exclusively, drawn from the manual tools of stonemasons – the [[square and compasses]], the level and plumb rule, the [[trowel]], among others. A moral lesson is attached to each of these tools, although the assignment is by no means consistent. The meaning of the symbolism is taught and explored through ritual.<ref name="Johnstone" />

All Freemasons begin their journey in the "craft" by being progressively ''initiated, passed ''and'' raised'' into the three degrees of Craft, or Blue Lodge Masonry. During these three rituals, the candidate is progressively taught the meanings of the Lodge symbols, and entrusted with grips, signs and words to signify to other Masons that he has been so initiated. The initiations are part allegory and part lecture, and revolve around the construction of the [[Temple of Solomon]], and the artistry and death of his chief architect, [[Hiram Abiff]]. The degrees are those of ''Entered apprentice, Fellowcraft'' and ''Master Mason''. While many different versions of these rituals exist, with at least two different lodge layouts and versions of the Hiram myth, each version is recognisable to any Freemason from any jurisdiction.<ref name="Johnstone" />

In some jurisdictions, the main themes of each degree are illustrated by [[tracing board]]s. These painted depictions of Masonic themes are exhibited in the lodge according to which degree is being worked, and are explained to the candidate to illustrate the legend and symbolism of each degree.<ref>[http://freemasonry.bcy.ca/texts/gmd1999/tb_history01.html Mark S. Dwor, "Some thoughts on the history of the Tracing Boards"], ''Grand Lodge of British Columbia and Yukon'', 1999, retrieved 7 November 2013</ref>

The idea of Masonic brotherhood probably descends from a 16th-century legal definition of a ''brother'' as one who has taken an oath of mutual support to another. Accordingly, Masons swear at each degree to keep the contents of that degree secret, and to support and protect their brethren unless they have broken the law.<ref>Robert L.D. Cooper, ''Cracking the Freemason's Code'', Rider 2006, p79</ref> In most Lodges the oath or obligation is taken on a ''[[Volume of Sacred Law]]'', whichever book of divine revelation is appropriate to the religious beliefs of the individual brother (usually the Bible in the Anglo-American tradition). In ''Progressive'' continental Freemasonry, books other than scripture are permissible, a cause of rupture between Grand Lodges.<ref>[http://bessel.org/masrec/france.htm "Masonic U.S. Recognition of French Grand Lodges in the 20th century"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060410074658/http://bessel.org/masrec/france.htm |date=10 April 2006 }}, ''Paul M.

==History==
{{Main|History of Freemasonry}}

===Origins===
[[File:Goose and Gridiron.jpg|thumb|alt=Goose and Gridiron|Goose and Gridiron, where the Grand Lodge of London and Westminster, later called the [[Premier Grand Lodge of England|Grand Lodge of England]] was founded]]
Since the middle of the 19th century, Masonic historians have sought the origins of the movement in a series of similar documents known as the [[Masonic manuscripts|Old Charges]], dating from the [[Masonic manuscripts|Regius Poem]] in about 1425<ref>[http://www.freemasons-freemasonry.com/prescott07.html Andrew Prescott, "The Old Charges Revisited"], from Transactions of the Lodge of Research No. 2429 (Leicester), 2006, ''Pietre-Stones Masonic Papers'', retrieved 12 October 2013</ref> to the beginning of the 18th century. Alluding to the membership of a lodge of operative masons, they relate a mythologised history of the craft, the duties of its grades, and the manner in which oaths of fidelity are to be taken on joining.<ref>A. F. A. Woodford, preface to William James Hughan, ''The Old Charges of British Freemasons'', London, 1872</ref> The 15th century also sees the first evidence of ceremonial regalia.<ref>{{Cite book | author = John Yarker | title = The Arcane Schools | location = Manchester | year = 1909 | pages = 341–342}}</ref>

There is no clear mechanism by which these local trade organisations became today's Masonic Lodges, but the earliest rituals and passwords known, from operative lodges around the turn of the 17th–18th centuries, show continuity with the rituals developed in the later 18th century by accepted or speculative Masons, as those members who did not practice the physical craft came to be known.<ref>Robert L.D. Cooper, ''Cracking the Freemason's Code'', Rider 2006, Chapter 4, p 53</ref> The minutes of the [[Lodge of Edinburgh (Mary's Chapel) No. 1]] in Scotland show a continuity from an operative lodge in 1598 to a modern speculative Lodge.<ref>David Murray Lyon, ''History of the Lodge of Edinburgh (Mary's Chapel) No 1'', Blackwood 1873, Preface</ref> It is reputed to be the oldest Masonic Lodge in the world.<ref>{{cite book|last=Stevenson|first=David|title=The Origins of Freemasonry|year=1988|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=0521396549|pages=38–44}}</ref>

Alternatively, [[Thomas De Quincey]] in his work titled; ''Rosicrucians and Freemasonry'', put forward the theory which suggested that Freemasonry was possibly an outgrowth of [[Rosicrucianism]]. The theory had also been postulated in 1803 by German professor; J. G. Buhle.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.masonicdictionary.com/rosicrucian.html|title=Rosicrucians and Freemasonry {{!}} Masonic Dictionary {{!}} www.masonicdictionary.com|last=Dafoe|first=Stephen|website=www.masonicdictionary.com|language=en|access-date=14 June 2017}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com.ng/books?id=-ffW5P6NW1kC&pg=PA395&lpg=PA395&dq=Freemasonry+is+an+outgrowth+of+rosicrucians#v=onepage&q=Freemasonry%20is%20an%20outgrowth%20of%20rosicrucians|title=The Secret Teachings of All Ages: An Encyclopedic Outline of Masonic, Hermetic, Qabbalistic and Rosicrucian Symbolical Philosophy|last=Hall|first=Manly P.|date=2010|publisher=Courier Corporation|isbn=9780486471433|language=en}}</ref>

The first Grand Lodge, the Grand Lodge of London and Westminster (later called the [[Premier Grand Lodge of England|Grand Lodge of England]] (GLE)), was founded on St John's Day, 24 June 1717,<ref>{{Cite website|URL=https://www.ugle.org.uk/about-freemasonry/history-of-freemasonry |title=History of Freemasonry timeline |publisher=United Grand Lodge of England |accessdate=12 June 2018}}</ref> when four existing London Lodges met for a joint dinner. Many English Lodges joined the new regulatory body, which itself entered a period of self-publicity and expansion. However, many Lodges could not endorse changes which some Lodges of the GLE made to the ritual (they came to be known as the Moderns), and a few of these formed a rival Grand Lodge on 17 July 1751, which they called the "[[Antient Grand Lodge of England]]." These two Grand Lodges vied for supremacy until the Moderns promised to return to the ancient ritual. They united on 27 December 1813 to form the [[United Grand Lodge of England]] (UGLE).<ref>{{Cite book|author=[[S.

The [[Grand Lodge of Ireland]] and the [[Grand Lodge of Scotland]] were formed in 1725 and 1736 respectively, although neither persuaded all of the existing lodges in their countries to join for many years.<ref>[http://www.freemasons-freemasonry.com/uk_grand_lodges.html H.

The earliest known American lodges were in [[Pennsylvania]]. The Collector for the port of Pennsylvania, John Moore, wrote of attending lodges there in 1715, two years before the formation of the first Grand Lodge in London.

====Prince Hall Freemasonry====
{{Main|Prince Hall Freemasonry}}

Prince Hall Freemasonry exists because of the refusal of early American lodges to admit [[African American]]s. In 1775, an African American named [[Prince Hall]],<ref>{{cite web

When the British military Lodge left North America after the end of the Revolution, those 15 men were given the authority to meet as a Lodge, but not to initiate Masons. In 1784, these individuals obtained a Warrant from the Premier Grand Lodge of England (GLE) and formed African Lodge, Number 459. When the [[UGLE]] was formed in 1813, all U.S.-based Lodges were stricken from their rolls&nbsp;– due largely to the [[War of 1812]]. Thus, separated from both UGLE and any concordantly recognised U.S. Grand Lodge, African Lodge retitled itself as the African Lodge, Number 1&nbsp;– and became a ''de facto'' Grand Lodge. (This lodge is not to be confused with the various Grand Lodges in [[Africa]].) As with the rest of U.S. Freemasonry, Prince Hall Freemasonry soon grew and organis<!-- NOTE: THIS ARTICLE USES UK SPELLING ... which spells this word with an "s" and not a "z". -->ed on a Grand Lodge system for each state.<ref>[http://www.princehall.org/History/Ray%20Colemans%20History.pdf "Prince Hall History Education Class" by Raymond T.

Widespread [[racial segregation]] in 19th- and early 20th-century North America made it difficult for African Americans to join Lodges outside of Prince Hall jurisdictions&nbsp;– and impossible for inter-jurisdiction recognition between the parallel U.S. Masonic authorities. By the 1980s, such discrimination was a thing of the past. Today most U.S. Grand Lodges recognise their Prince Hall counterparts, and the authorities of both traditions are working towards full recognition.<ref>{{cite web

===Emergence of Continental Freemasonry===
[[File:Freimaurer Initiation.jpg|thumb|alt=Masonic initiation, Paris, 1745|Masonic initiation, Paris, 1745]]
English Freemasonry spread to France in the 1720s, first as lodges of expatriates and exiled [[Jacobitism|Jacobites]], and then as distinctively French lodges which still follow the ritual of the [[Premier Grand Lodge of England|Moderns]]. From France and England, Freemasonry spread to most of Continental Europe during the course of the 18th century. The Grande Loge de France formed under the Grand Mastership of the Duke of Clermont, who exercised only nominal authority. His successor, the [[Louis Philippe II, Duke of Orléans|Duke of Orléans]], reconstituted the central body as the Grand Orient de France in 1773. Briefly eclipsed during the [[French Revolution]], French Freemasonry continued to grow in the next century,<ref>[http://www.godf.org/index.php/pages/details/slug/histoire-de-la-franc-maconnerie ''Histoire de la Franc-maçonnerie''], Grand Orient de France, retrieved 12 November 2013</ref> at first under the leadership of [[Alexandre Francois Auguste de Grasse]], Comte de Grassy-Tilly. A career Army officer, he had lived with his family in [[Charleston, South Carolina]] from 1793 to the early 1800s, after leaving [[Saint-Domingue]] (now Haiti) during the years of the [[Haitian Revolution]].

====Schism====

The ritual form on which the Grand Orient of France was based was abolished in England in the events leading to the formation of the [[United Grand Lodge of England]] in 1813. However the two jurisdictions continued in amity (mutual recognition) until events of the 1860s and 1870s drove a seemingly permanent wedge between them. In 1868 the ''Supreme Council of the Ancient and Accepted Scottish Rite of the State of Louisiana'' appeared in the jurisdiction of the Grand Lodge of Louisiana, recognised by the Grand Orient de France, but regarded by the older body as an invasion of their jurisdiction. The new Scottish Rite body admitted blacks. The resolution of the Grand Orient the following year that neither colour, race, nor religion could disqualify a man from Masonry prompted the Grand Lodge to withdraw recognition, and it persuaded other American Grand Lodges to do the same.<ref>[http://bessel.org/masrec/france.htm Paul Bessel, "U.S. Recognition of French Grand Lodges in the 1900s"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060410074658/http://bessel.org/masrec/france.htm |date=10 April 2006 }}, from ''Heredom: The Transactions of the Scottish Rite Research Society'', vol 5, 1996, pp 221–244, ''Paul Bessel'' website, retrieved 12 November 2013</ref>

A dispute during the [[Lausanne Congress of Supreme Councils of 1875]] prompted the Grand Orient de France to commission a report by a Protestant pastor which concluded that, as Freemasonry was not a religion, it should not require a religious belief. The new constitutions read, "Its principles are absolute liberty of conscience and human solidarity", the existence of God and the immortality of the soul being struck out. It is possible that the immediate objections of the United Grand Lodge of England were at least partly motivated by the political tension between France and Britain at the time. The result was the withdrawal of recognition of the Grand Orient of France by the United Grand Lodge of England, a situation that continues today.<ref name="Buta"/>

Not all French lodges agreed with the new wording. In 1894, lodges favouring the compulsory recognition of the Great Architect of the Universe formed the [[Grande Loge de France]].<ref>[http://www.gldf.org/gldf-obedience-maconnique/gldf-qui-sommes-nous/historique-de-la-gldf.html ''Historique de la GLDF''], Grande Loge de France, retrieved 14 November 2013</ref> In 1913, the United Grand Lodge of England recognised a new Grand Lodge of Regular Freemasons, a Grand Lodge that follows a similar rite to Anglo-American Freemasonry with a mandatory belief in a deity.<ref>[http://www.freemasons-freemasonry.com/bernheim27.html Alain Bernheim, "My approach to Masonic History"], Manchester 2011, ''Pietre-Stones'', retrieved 14 November 2013</ref>

There are now three strands of Freemasonry in France, which extend into the rest of Continental Europe:-
* Liberal (also adogmatic or progressive) – Principles of liberty of conscience, and laicity, particularly the separation of the Church and State.<ref>[http://www.frenchfreemasonry.org/grand-lodges/liberal-freemasonry "Liberal Grand Lodges"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150120051953/http://www.frenchfreemasonry.org/grand-lodges/liberal-freemasonry |date=20 January 2015 }}, ''French Freemasonry'', retrieved 14 November 2013</ref>
* Traditional – Old French ritual with a requirement for a belief in a Supreme Being.<ref>[http://www.frenchfreemasonry.org/grand-lodges/traditional-grand-lodges "Traditional Grand Lodges"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714115355/http://www.frenchfreemasonry.org/grand-lodges/traditional-grand-lodges |date=14 July 2014 }}, ''French Freemasonry'', retrieved 14 November 2013</ref> (This strand is typified by the [[Grande Loge de France]]).
* Regular – Standard Anglo-American ritual, mandatory belief in Supreme Being.<ref>[http://www.frenchfreemasonry.org/grand-lodges/regular-grand-lodges "Regular Grand Lodges"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150120052209/http://www.frenchfreemasonry.org/grand-lodges/regular-grand-lodges |date=20 January 2015 }}, ''French Freemasonry'', retrieved 14 November 2013</ref>

The term [[Continental Freemasonry]] was used in Mackey's 1873 ''Encyclopedia of Freemasonry'' to "designate the Lodges on the Continent of Europe which retain many usages which have either been abandoned by, or never were observed in, the Lodges of England, Ireland, and Scotland, as well as the United States of America".<ref>[http://encyclopediaoffreemasonry.com/c/continental-lodges/ "Continental Lodges"],''Mackey's Encyclopedia of Freemasonry'', retrieved 30 November 2013</ref> Today, it is frequently used to refer to only the Liberal jurisdictions typified by the Grand Orient de France.<ref>For instance [http://cornwineoil.blogspot.co.uk/2009/06/women-in-freemasonry-and-oriental.html "Women in Freemasonry, and Continental Freemasonry"], ''Corn Wine and Oil'', June 2009, retrieved 30 November 2013</ref>

The majority of Freemasonry considers the Liberal (Continental) strand to be Irregular, and thus withhold recognition. For the Continental lodges, however, having a different approach to Freemasonry was not a reason for severing masonic ties. In 1961, an umbrella organisation, [[Centre de Liaison et d'Information des Puissances maçonniques Signataires de l'Appel de Strasbourg]] (CLIPSAS) was set up, which today provides a forum for most of these Grand Lodges and Grand Orients worldwide. Included in the list of over 70 Grand Lodges and Grand Orients are representatives of all three of the above categories, including mixed and women's organisations. The United Grand Lodge of England does not communicate with any of these jurisdictions, and expects its allies to follow suit. This creates the distinction between Anglo-American and Continental Freemasonry.<ref>[http://www.freemasons-freemasonry.com/pope7.html Tony Pope, "At a Perpetual Distance: Liberal and Adogmatic Grand Lodges"], Presented to Waikato Lodge of Research No 445 at Rotorua, New Zealand, on 9 November 2004, as the annual Verrall Lecture, and subsequently published in the ''Transactions'' of the lodge, vol 14 #1, March 2005, ''Pietre-Stones'', retrieved 13 November 2013</ref><ref>[http://www.clipsas.com/en/membros-do-clipsas/ "Current members"] ''CLIPSAS'', retrieved 14 November 2014</ref>

===Italy===
In the early 20th century Freemasonry was an influential semi-secret force in Italian politics with a strong presence among professionals and the middle class across Italy, as well as among the leadership of the parliament, public administration, and the army. The two main organisation were the Grand Orient and the Grand Lodge of Italy. They had 25,000 members in 500 or more lodges. Freemasons took on the challenge of mobilizing the press, public opinion and the leading political parties in support of [[Italian entry into World War I|Italy's joining the Allies]] of the First World War in 1914-1915. Traditionally, they promoted Italian nationalism focused on unification, and undermining the power of the Catholic Church. In 1914-15 they dropped the traditional pacifistic rhetoric and used instead the powerful language of [[Italian nationalism]]. Freemasonry had always promoted cosmopolitan universal values, and by 1917 onwards they demanded a [[League of Nations]] to promote a new post-war universal order based upon the peaceful coexistence of independent and democratic nations.<ref>Fulvio Conti, "From Universalism to Nationalism: Italian Freemasonry and the Great War." ''Journal of Modern Italian Studies'' 20.5 (2015): 640-662.</ref>

===Freemasonry and women===
{{Main|Freemasonry and women|Co-Freemasonry}}

The status of women in the old guilds and corporations of mediaeval masons remains uncertain. The principle of "femme sole" allowed a widow to continue the trade of her husband, but its application had wide local variations, such as full membership of a trade body or limited trade by deputation or approved members of that body.<ref>Antonia Frazer, ''The Weaker Vessel'', Mandarin paperbacks, 1989, pp108-109</ref> In masonry, the small available evidence points to the less empowered end of the scale.<ref>for example, see David Murray Lyon, ''History of the lodge of Edinburgh'', Blackwood, Edinburgh, 1873, pp 121–123</ref>

At the dawn of the [[History of Freemasonry#Early Grand Lodge Period|Grand Lodge era]], during the 1720s, [[James Anderson (Freemason)|James Anderson]] composed the [[Anderson's Constitutions|first printed constitutions for Freemasons]], the basis for most subsequent constitutions, which specifically excluded women from Freemasonry.<ref name=AndersonCharge3>

[[Maria Deraismes]] was initiated into Freemasonry in 1882, then resigned to allow her lodge to rejoin their Grand Lodge. Having failed to achieve acceptance from any masonic governing body, she and [[Georges Martin (freemason)|Georges Martin]] started a mixed masonic lodge that worked masonic ritual.<ref>[http://www.droithumain-france.org/node/151 "Maria Deraismes (1828–1894)"], ''Droit Humain'', retrieved 5 March 2013.

Meanwhile, the French had re-invented Adoption as an all-female lodge in 1901, only to cast it aside again in 1935. The lodges, however, continued to meet, which gave rise, in 1959, to a body of women practising continental Freemasonry.<ref name="Thames" />

In general, Continental Freemasonry is sympathetic to Freemasonry amongst women, dating from the 1890s when French lodges assisted the emergent co-masonic movement by promoting enough of their members to the 33rd degree of the [[Ancient and Accepted Scottish Rite]] to allow them, in 1899, to form their own grand council, recognised by the other Continental Grand Councils of that Rite.<ref name="DHHistoire">[https://web.archive.org/web/20111021235404/http://www.droithumain-france.org/contenu/identite-histoire/histoire/les-grandes-figures/histoire-du-droit-humain "Histoire du Droit Humain"], ''Droit Humain'', retrieved 12 August 2013</ref> The United Grand Lodge of England issued a statement in 1999 recognising the two women's grand lodges there to be regular in all but the participants.

''Anti-Masonry'' (alternatively called ''Anti-Freemasonry'') has been defined as "opposition to Freemasonry",<ref>"Anti-Masonry" – ''Oxford English Dictionary (Compact Edition)'', Oxford University Press, 1979, p.369</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.webster-dictionary.net/d.aspx?w=Antimasonry |title=Antimasonry – Definition of Antimasonry by Webster Dictionary |publisher=Webster-dictionary.net |accessdate=8 September 2011}}</ref> but there is no homogeneous anti-Masonic movement. Anti-Masonry consists of widely differing criticisms from diverse (and often incompatible) groups who are hostile to Freemasonry in some form.

These hoaxes and exposés have often become the basis for criticism of Masonry, often religious or political in nature or are based on suspicion of corrupt conspiracy of some form. The political opposition that arose after the "[[William Morgan (anti-Mason)#The Morgan affair|Morgan Affair]]" in 1826 gave rise to the term ''Anti-Masonry'', which is still in use today, both by Masons in referring to their critics and as a self-descriptor by the critics themselves.<ref>[http://dictionary.infoplease.com/anti-mason "Anti-mason"] ''infoplease.com'' retrieved 9 January 2014</ref>

===Religious opposition===
Freemasonry has attracted criticism from [[theocracy|theocratic]] states and organised religions for supposed competition with religion, or supposed [[heterodoxy]] within the fraternity itself, and has long been the target of [[Masonic conspiracy theories|conspiracy theories]], which assert Freemasonry to be an [[occult]] and evil power.<ref>Morris, S.

====Christianity and Freemasonry====
{{Main|Opposition to Freemasonry within Christianity}}

Although members of various faiths cite objections, certain Christian [[religious denomination|denominations]] have had high-profile negative attitudes to Masonry, banning or discouraging their members from being Freemasons.

The denomination with the longest history of objection to Freemasonry is the [[Catholic Church]]. The objections raised by the Catholic Church are based on the allegation that Masonry teaches a naturalistic [[deistic]] religion which is in conflict with Church [[doctrine]].<ref>{{cite web| url = http://www.catholicculture.org/library/view.cfm?recnum=5285 | title = Letter of 19 April 1985 to U.S. Bishops Concerning Masonry | last = Cardinal Law | first = Bernard | authorlink = Bernard Francis Law | accessdate = 9 July 2007 | date = 19 April 1985 | work = CatholicCulture.org }}</ref> A number of Papal pronouncements have been issued against Freemasonry. The first was [[Pope Clement XII]]'s ''[[In eminenti apostolatus]],'' 28 April 1738; the most recent was [[Pope Leo XIII]]'s ''[[Ab apostolici]],'' 15 October 1890. The ''[[1917 Code of Canon Law]]'' explicitly declared that joining Freemasonry entailed automatic [[excommunication]], and banned books favouring Freemasonry.<ref name="canon2335">Canon 2335, 1917 Code of Canon Law from {{cite web| url = http://freemasonry.bcy.ca/anti-masonry/canon.html | title = Canon Law regarding Freemasonry, 1917–1983 | publisher = Grand Lodge of British Columbia and Yukon }}</ref>

In 1983, the Church issued a new code of [[Canon law (Catholic Church)|canon law]]. Unlike its predecessor, the ''[[1983 Code of Canon Law]]'' did not explicitly name Masonic orders among the [[secret societies]] it condemns. It states: "A person who joins an association which plots against the Church is to be punished with a just penalty; one who promotes or takes office in such an association is to be punished with an [[Interdict (Roman Catholic Church)|interdict]]." This named omission of Masonic orders caused both Catholics and Freemasons to believe that the ban on Catholics becoming Freemasons may have been lifted, especially after the perceived liberalisation of [[Second Vatican Council|Vatican II]].<ref name="RCLaw">{{Cite journal| last = McInvale | first = Reid | year = 1991 | title = Roman Catholic Church Law Regarding Freemasonry | journal = Transactions of Texas Lodge of Research | volume = 27 | pages = 86–97 | url = http://bessel.org/cathtlor.htm | issn = | oclc = 47204246 }}</ref> However, the matter was clarified when Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger (later [[Pope Benedict XVI]]), [[Joseph Ratzinger as Prefect of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith|as the Prefect]] of the [[Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith]], issued a [[Declaration on Masonic Associations]], which states: "...&nbsp;the Church's negative judgment in regard to Masonic association remains unchanged since their principles have always been considered irreconcilable with the doctrine of the Church and therefore membership in them remains forbidden.

In contrast to Catholic allegations of rationalism and naturalism, Protestant objections are more likely to be based on allegations of [[mysticism]], [[occultism]], and even [[Satanism]].<ref name=Satanism >{{cite web|url=http://www.chick.com/reading/tracts/0093/0093_01.asp |title=The Curse of Baphomet |accessdate=29 September 2007 |author=Jack Chick }}</ref> Masonic scholar [[Albert Pike]] is often quoted (in some cases misquoted) by Protestant anti-Masons as an authority for the position of Masonry on these issues.<ref>{{cite book|author=Arturo de Hoyos and S.

[[Free Methodist Church]] founder [[B.T. Roberts]] was a vocal opponent of Freemasonry in the mid 19th century. Roberts opposed the society on moral grounds and stated, "The god of the lodge is not the God of the Bible." Roberts believed Freemasonry was a "[[Greco-Roman mysteries|mystery]]" or "alternate" religion and encouraged his church not to support ministers who were Freemasons. Freedom from secret societies is one of the "frees" upon which the Free Methodist Church was founded.<ref>{{Cite book| last = Snyder | first = Howard | title = Populist Saints | location = [[Grand Rapids, Michigan]]| publisher = William B.

Since the founding of Freemasonry, many Bishops of the [[Church of England]] have been Freemasons, such as [[Archbishop]] [[Geoffrey Fisher]].<ref>{{Cite journal| last = Beresiner | first = Yasha |date=July 2006 | title = Archbishop Fisher&nbsp;– A Godly man and a Brother | journal = Masonic Quarterly Magazine | issue = 18 | url = http://www.mqmagazine.co.uk/issue-18/p-07.php?PHPSESSID=c59cd231db419873a6a6 | accessdate = 7 May 2007 }}</ref> In the past, few members of the Church of England would have seen any incongruity in concurrently adhering to Anglican Christianity and practising Freemasonry. In recent decades, however, reservations about Freemasonry have increased within Anglicanism, perhaps due to the increasing prominence of the evangelical wing of the church. The former [[Archbishop of Canterbury]], [[Rowan Williams|Dr Rowan Williams]], appeared to harbour some reservations about Masonic ritual, whilst being anxious to avoid causing offence to Freemasons inside and outside the Church of England. In 2003 he felt it necessary to apologise to British Freemasons after he said that their beliefs were incompatible with Christianity and that he had barred the appointment of Freemasons to senior posts in his diocese when he was Bishop of Monmouth.<ref>{{Cite news | url = https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2003/04/20/nmason20.xml&sSheet=/news/2003/04/20/ixhome.html | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071123132655/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=%2Fnews%2F2003%2F04%2F20%2Fnmason20.xml&sSheet=%2Fnews%2F2003%2F04%2F20%2Fixhome.html | archivedate = 23 November 2007 | title = Rowan Williams apologises to Freemasons | first = Chris | last = Hastings | author2 = Elizabeth Day | work = [[The Daily Telegraph]] | date = 20 April 2003 | accessdate = 9 July 2007 | deadurl = yes | df = dmy-all }}</ref>

In 1933, the [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox]] [[Church of Greece]] officially declared that being a Freemason constitutes an act of [[Apostasy in Christianity|apostasy]] and thus, until he repents, the person involved with Freemasonry cannot partake of the [[Eucharist]]. This has been generally affirmed throughout the whole Eastern Orthodox Church. The Orthodox critique of Freemasonry agrees with both the Catholic and Protestant versions: "Freemasonry cannot be at all compatible with Christianity as far as it is a secret organisation, acting and teaching in mystery and secret and deifying rationalism."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.orthodoxinfo.com/ecumenism/masonry.aspx |title=Freemasonry: Official Statement of the Church of Greece (1933) |publisher=Orthodoxinfo.com |date=12 October 1933 |accessdate=15 January 2011}}</ref>

Regular Freemasonry has traditionally not responded to these claims, beyond the often repeated statement that those Grand Lodges in amity with UGLE explicitly adhere to the principle that "Freemasonry is not a religion, nor a substitute for religion. There is no separate 'Masonic deity,' and there is no separate proper name for a deity in Freemasonry."<ref name="a religion?">{{cite web|url=http://grandlodgeofiowa.org/docs/Freemasonry_Religion/FreemasonryAndReligion.pdf |title=Freemasonry and Religion |accessdate=2 November 2013 |publisher=United Grand Lodge of England}}</ref>

Christian men, who were discouraged from joining the Freemasons by their Churches or who wanted a more religiocentric society, joined similar fraternal organisations, such as the [[Knights of Columbus]] for Catholic Christians, and the [[Orange Order|Loyal Orange Institution]] for Protestant Christians,<ref name="Jeffers2005">{{cite book|last=Jeffers|first=H.

====Islam and Freemasonry====
Many [[Islamic]] anti-Masonic arguments are closely tied to both [[antisemitism]] and [[Anti-Zionism]], though other criticisms are made such as linking Freemasonry to [[Al-Masih ad-Dajjal]] (the false Messiah in Islamic Scripture).<ref name="freemasonryinSHIraq"/><ref name="SFMNAD">{{Cite book| url = http://www.freemasons-freemasonry.com/prescott03.html| title = The Study of Freemasonry as a New Academic Discipline | pages = 13–14 | first = Andrew | last = Prescott | accessdate = 18 December 2008 }}</ref> Some Muslim anti-Masons argue that Freemasonry promotes the interests of the [[Jews]] around the world and that one of its aims is to destroy the [[Al-Aqsa Mosque]] in order to rebuild the [[Temple of Solomon]] in [[Jerusalem]].<ref>[http://wakeupfromyourslumber.com/node/4119 "Can a Muslim be a Freemason"] ''Wake up from your slumber'', 2007, retrieved 8 January 2014</ref> In article 28 of its Covenant, [[Hamas]] states that Freemasonry, [[Rotary International|Rotary]], and other similar groups "work in the interest of Zionism and according to its instructions ..."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://avalon.law.yale.edu/20th_century/hamas.asp |title=Hamas Covenant 1988 |publisher=Avalon.law.yale.edu |date=18 August 1988 |accessdate=15 January 2011}}</ref>

Many countries with a majority Muslim population do not allow Masonic establishments within their borders. However, countries such as [[Turkey]] and [[Morocco]] have established Grand Lodges,<ref>Leyiktez, Celil. [http://www.freemasons-freemasonry.com/layiktez1.html "Freemasonry in the Islamic World"], ''Pietre-Stones'' Retrieved 2 October 2007.</ref> while in countries such as [[Malaysia]]<ref>[http://dglea.org/ "Home Page", ''District Grand Lodge of the Eastern Archipelago''], retrieved 9 January 2014</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thestar.com.my/Story.aspx/?file=%2F2005%2F4%2F17%2Ffocus%2F10649415&sec=focus |date=17 April 2005 |accessdate=13 February 2014 |title=Mystery unveiled |publisher = The Star Online}}</ref> and [[Lebanon]]<ref>[http://freemasonlb.net/Lodges.html ''Freemasonry in Lebanon''] Lodges linked to the Grand Lodge of Scotland, retrieved 22 August 2013</ref> there are District Grand Lodges operating under a warrant from an established Grand Lodge.

In Pakistan in 1972, [[Zulfikar Ali Bhutto|Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto]], then [[Prime Minister of Pakistan]], placed a ban on Freemasonry. Lodge buildings were confiscated by the government.<ref>[http://www.dawn.com/news/508406/masonic-mystique Peerzada Salman, "Masonic Mystique"], December 2009, ''Dawn.com'' (News site), retrieved 3 January 2012</ref>

Masonic lodges existed in [[Iraq]] as early as 1917, when the first lodge under the [[United Grand Lodge of England]] (UGLE) was opened. Nine lodges under UGLE existed by the 1950s, and a Scottish lodge was formed in 1923. However, the position changed following the revolution, and all lodges were forced to close in 1965.<ref>[http://www.freemasons-freemasonry.com/freemasonry-islamic-countries.html Kent Henderson, "Freemasonry in Islamic Countries"], 2007 paper, ''Pietre Stones'', retrieved 4 January 2014</ref> This position was later reinforced under [[Saddam Hussein]]; the death penalty was "prescribed" for those who "promote or acclaim Zionist principles, including freemasonry, or who associate [themselves] with Zionist organisations."<ref name="freemasonryinSHIraq" />

===Political opposition===
{{See also|Anti-Masonry|Suppression of Freemasonry}}

In 1799, English Freemasonry almost came to a halt due to Parliamentary proclamation. In the wake of the [[French Revolution]], the [[Unlawful Societies Act]] banned any meetings of groups that required their members to take an [[oath]] or obligation.<ref name="USA1799">[http://www.freemasons-freemasonry.com/prescott15.html Andrew Prescott, "The Unlawful Societies Act"], First published in M. D. J.

The Grand Masters of both the Moderns and the Antients Grand Lodges called on Prime Minister [[William Pitt the Younger|William Pitt]] (who was not a Freemason) and explained to him that Freemasonry was a supporter of the law and lawfully constituted authority and was much involved in charitable work. As a result, Freemasonry was specifically exempted from the terms of the Act, provided that each private lodge's Secretary placed with the local "Clerk of the Peace" a list of the members of his lodge once a year. This continued until 1967, when the obligation of the provision was rescinded by [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament]].<ref name="USA1799" />

Freemasonry in the United States faced political pressure following the 1826 kidnapping of [[William Morgan (anti-Mason)|William Morgan]] by Freemasons and his subsequent disappearance. Reports of the "Morgan Affair", together with opposition to [[Jacksonian democracy]] (Andrew Jackson was a prominent Mason), helped fuel an Anti-Masonic movement. The short-lived [[Anti-Masonic Party]] was formed, which fielded candidates for the presidential elections of 1828 and 1832.<ref>[http://freemasonry.bcy.ca/texts/morgan_affair.html "The Morgan Affair"], Reprinted from ''The Short Talk Bulletin'' – Vol. XI, March 1933 No. 3, ''Grand Lodge of British Columbia and Yukon'', retrieved 4 January 2014</ref>

In Italy, Freemasonry has become linked to a scandal concerning the [[Propaganda Due]] lodge (a.k.a. P2). This lodge was chartered by the [[Grande Oriente d'Italia]] in 1877, as a lodge for visiting Masons unable to attend their own lodges. Under [[Licio Gelli]]'s leadership, in the late 1970s, P2 became involved in the financial scandals that nearly bankrupted the [[Vatican Bank]]. However, by this time the lodge was operating independently and irregularly, as the Grand Orient had revoked its charter and expelled Gelli in 1976.<ref>{{cite web| first = Edward L. | last = King | url = http://www.masonicinfo.com/p2_lodge.htm | title = P2 Lodge | year = 2007 | accessdate = 31 October 2006 }}</ref>

[[Conspiracy theorists]] have long associated Freemasonry with the [[New World Order (conspiracy theory)|New World Order]] and the [[Illuminati]], and state that Freemasonry as an organisation is either bent on world domination or already secretly in control of world politics. Historically, Freemasonry has attracted criticism—and suppression—from both the politically [[far right]] (e.g., [[Nazi Germany]])<ref>{{Cite book| first = James | last = Wilkenson |author2=H.

Freemasonry is both successful and controversial in France. As of the early 21st century, membership is rising, but reporting in the popular media is often negative.<ref name=Hodapp86 />

In some countries anti-Masonry is often related to [[antisemitism]] and anti-[[Zionism]]. For example, in 1980 the [[Iraq]]i [[Law of Iraq|legal]] and [[Iraqi Penal Code|penal code]] was changed by [[Saddam Hussein]]'s ruling [[Ba'ath Party (Iraq)|Ba'ath Party]], making it a felony to "promote or acclaim Zionist principles, including Freemasonry, or who associate [themselves] with Zionist organisations".<ref name="freemasonryinSHIraq">{{Cite news| url = http://washingtontimes.com/world/20040701-120129-6565r.htm | title = Saddam to be formally charged | first = David R | last = Sands | work = [[The Washington Times]] | date = 1 July 2004 | accessdate = 18 June 2006 }}</ref> Professor Andrew Prescott of the [[University of Sheffield]] writes: "Since at least the time of the [[The Protocols of the Elders of Zion|Protocols of the Elders of Zion]], antisemitism has gone hand in hand with anti-masonry, so it is not surprising that allegations that [[11 September 2001 attacks|11 September]] was a Zionist plot have been accompanied by suggestions that the attacks were inspired by a masonic world order".<ref>Prescott, pp. 13–14, 30, 33.</ref>

The preserved records of the ''[[RSHA|Reichssicherheitshauptamt]]'' (the Reich Security Main Office) show the persecution of Freemasons during [[the Holocaust]].<ref>{{cite web | url = http://mill-valley.freemasonry.biz/persecution.htm | title = World War II Documents showing the persecution of Freemasonry | publisher = Mill Valley Lodge #356 | accessdate = 21 May 2006 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20121210071945/http://mill-valley.freemasonry.biz/persecution.htm | archivedate = 10 December 2012 | df = dmy-all }}</ref> RSHA Amt VII (Written Records) was overseen by Professor [[Franz Six]] and was responsible for "ideological" tasks, by which was meant the creation of antisemitic and anti-Masonic propaganda.

The small blue [[forget-me-not]] flower was first used by the Grand Lodge ''Zur Sonne'', in 1926, as a Masonic emblem at the annual convention in [[Bremen (city)|Bremen]], Germany. In 1938 a forget-me-not badge—made by the same factory as the Masonic badge—was chosen for the annual Nazi Party ''[[Winterhilfswerk]]'', the annual charity drive of the [[National Socialist People's Welfare]], the welfare branch of the Nazi party. This coincidence enabled Freemasons to wear the forget-me-not badge as a secret sign of membership.<ref>{{cite web| url = http://www.internetloge.de/arst/forgetd.htm | title = Das Vergißmeinnicht-Abzeichen und die Freimaurerei, Die wahre Geschichte | language = German | publisher = Internetloge.de | accessdate = 8 July 2006 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web| url = http://www.freemasons-freemasonry.com/bernheim3.html | first = Alain | last = Bernheim | title = The Blue Forget-Me-Not: Another Side Of The Story | work = Pietre-Stones Review of Freemasonry | publisher = | date = 10 September 2004 | accessdate = 8 July 2006 }}</ref><ref>{{Cite book| title = Die Freimaurer-Logen Deutschlands und deren Grosslogen 1737–1972 | first = Karl Heinz | last = Francke |author2=Ernst-Günther Geppert | location = Bayreuth | publisher = Quatuor Coronati | year = 1974 | language = German | isbn = | oclc = | edition = Second rev.}}Also in: {{Cite book| title = Die Freimaurer-Logen Deutschlands und deren Grosslogen 1737 – 1985 : Matrikel und Stammbuch; Nachschlagewerk über 248 Jahre Geschichte der Freimaurerei in Deutschland | first = Karl Heinz | last = Francke |author2=Ernst-Günther Geppert | location = Bayreuth | publisher = Quatuor Coronati | year = 1988 | language = German | isbn = 978-3-925749-05-6 | oclc = 75446479 }}</ref>
