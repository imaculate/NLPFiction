'''Prevailing winds''' are winds that blow predominantly from an individual direction over a particular point on the [[Earth|Earth's]] surface. The dominant winds are the trends in direction of wind with the highest speed over a particular point on the Earth's surface. A region's prevailing and dominant winds are enacted by global patterns of movement in the [[Earth's atmosphere]].<ref>URS (2008).

Retrieved on 2009-04-26.</ref>  In general, easterly flow occurs at low and medium latitudes globally. In the mid-latitudes, westerly winds are the rule and their strength is largely determined by the [[polar cyclone]]. In areas where winds tend to be light, the [[sea breeze]]/land breeze cycle is the most important to the prevailing wind; in areas which have variable terrain, [[Mountain breeze and valley breeze|mountain and valley breezes]] dominate the wind pattern. Highly elevated surfaces can induce a [[thermal low]], which then augments the environmental wind flow.

[[Wind rose]]s are tools used to determine the direction of the prevailing wind. Knowledge of the prevailing wind allows the development of prevention strategies for [[Soil erosion#Wind erosion|wind erosion]] of agricultural land, such as across the [[Great Plains]]. [[Sand dune]]s can orient themselves perpendicular to the prevailing wind regime within coastal and desert locations. Insects drift along with the prevailing wind, while birds are able to fly more independently of it. Prevailing winds in mountain locations can lead to significant [[precipitation (meteorology)|rainfall]] gradients within the topography, ranging from wet across windward-facing slopes to [[desert]]-like conditions along their lee slopes. Prevailing winds can have differences due to the uneven heating of the Earth.

{{Main|Wind rose}}
A [[wind rose]] is a graphic tool used by [[meteorologist]]s to give a succinct view of how [[wind speed]] and direction are typically distributed at a particular location.  Presented in a [[polar coordinate system|polar coordinate]] grid, the wind rose shows the frequency of winds blowing from particular directions.  The length of each spoke around the circle is related to the frequency that the wind blows from a particular direction per unit time.  Each concentric circle represents a different frequency, emanating from zero at the center to increasing frequencies at the outer circles. A wind rose plot may contain additional information, in that each spoke is broken down into color-coded bands that show wind direction ranges.  Wind roses typically use 8 or 16 [[cardinal direction]]s, such as north (N), NNE, NE, etc.,<ref>Glossary of Meteorology (2009).

Together with the [[trade wind]]s, the westerlies enabled a round-trip trade route for sailing ships crossing the Atlantic and Pacific oceans, as the westerlies lead to the development of strong ocean currents in both hemispheres.  The westerlies can be particularly strong, especially in the southern hemisphere, where there is less land in the middle latitudes to cause the flow pattern to amplify, which slows the winds down.  The strongest westerly winds in the middle latitudes are called the [[Roaring Forties]], between [[40th parallel south|40]] and [[50th parallel south|50 degrees south]] latitude, within the Southern Hemisphere.<ref>{{cite book|last=Walker|first=Stuart|title=The sailor's wind |publisher=W.

The westerlies explain why coastal North America tends to be wet, especially from Northern California to Alaska, during the winter. Differential heating from the sun between the land which is quite cool and the ocean which is relatively warm causes areas of low pressure to develop over land. This results in moisture rich air from the Pacific Ocean to flow from the west, resulting in frequent rainstorms and wind on the coast. This moisture continues to flow eastward until [[orographic lift]] caused by the Coast, Cascade, Columbia and Rocky Mountains cause a [[rain shadow]] effect which limits further penetration of these systems and associated rainfall eastward. This trend reverses in the summer when strong heating of the land causes high pressure and tends to block moisture-rich air from the Pacific from reaching land. This explains why most of coastal North America in the middle latitudes experiences dry summers, despite abundant rainfall in the winter.<ref name="Glossary of Meteorology 2009"/><ref name="Sue Ferguson"/>

===Polar easterlies===
{{Main|Polar easterlies}}
The [[polar easterlies]] (also known as Polar Hadley cells) are the dry, cold prevailing winds that blow from the [[high-pressure area]]s of the [[polar high]]s at the [[North Pole|North]] and [[South Pole]]s towards the low-pressure areas within the westerlies at high latitudes.  Like trade winds and unlike the westerlies, these prevailing winds blow from the [[east]] to the [[west]], and are often weak and irregular.<ref>Glossary of Meteorology (2009).

===Sea and land breezes===
{{Main|Sea breeze}}
[[Image:Diagrama de formacion de la brisa-breeze.svg|thumb|250px|A: Sea breeze, B: Land breeze]]
In areas where the wind flow is light, sea breezes and land breezes are important factors in a location's prevailing winds. The [[ocean|sea]] is warmed by the sun to a greater depth than the land due to its greater [[specific heat]].<ref>Dr. Steve Ackerman (1995). [http://cimss.ssec.wisc.edu/wxwise/seabrz.html Sea and Land Breezes.] [[University of Wisconsin]]. Retrieved on 2006-10-24.</ref>  The sea therefore has a greater capacity for absorbing heat than the land, so the surface of the sea warms up more slowly than the land's surface.  As the temperature of the surface of the [[landform|land]] rises, the land heats the air above it.  The warm air is less dense and so it rises.  This rising air over the land lowers the [[sea level pressure]] by about 0.2%.  The cooler air above the sea, now with higher sea level pressure, flows towards the land into the lower pressure, creating a cooler breeze near the coast.

The strength of the sea breeze is directly proportional to the temperature difference between the land mass and the sea.  If an off-shore wind of {{convert|8|kn|km/h}} exists, the sea breeze is not likely to develop.  At night, the land cools off more quickly than the ocean due to differences in their [[specific heat]] values, which forces the daytime sea breeze to dissipate.  If the temperature onshore cools below the temperature offshore, the pressure over the water will be lower than that of the land, establishing a land breeze, as long as an onshore wind is not strong enough to oppose it.<ref name="Jet">JetStream:  An Online School For Weather (2008).

If there is a [[mountain pass|pass]] in the mountain range, winds will rush through the pass with considerable speed due to the [[Bernoulli principle]] that describes an inverse relationship between speed and pressure.

Daytime heating and nighttime cooling of the hilly slopes lead to day to night variations in the airflow, similar to the relationship between sea breeze and land breeze.  At night, the sides of the hills cool through radiation of the heat.  The air along the hills becomes cooler and denser, blowing down into the valley, drawn by gravity.  This is known a [[katabatic wind]] or mountain breeze.  If the slopes are covered with ice and snow, the katabatic wind will blow during the day, carrying the cold dense air into the warmer, barren valleys.  The slopes of hills not covered by snow will be warmed during the day. The air that comes in contact with the warmed slopes becomes warmer and less dense and flows uphill. This is known as an [[anabatic]] wind or valley breeze.<ref>ALLSTAR Network (2009).

[[Orographic]] precipitation occurs on the [[windward]] side of mountains and is caused by the rising air motion of a large-scale flow of moist air across the mountain ridge, resulting in [[Adiabatic lapse rate|adiabatic]] cooling and [[condensation]].  In mountainous parts of the world subjected to consistent winds (for example, the [[trade wind]]s), a more moist [[climate]] usually prevails on the windward side of a mountain than on the [[leeward]] or downwind side. Moisture is removed by orographic lift, leaving drier air (see [[katabatic wind]]) on the descending and generally warming, leeward side where a [[rain shadow]] is observed.<ref name="MT">Dr. Michael Pidwirny (2008).
