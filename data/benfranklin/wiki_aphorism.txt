An '''aphorism''' (from [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] ἀφορισμός: ''aphorismos'', denoting "delimitation", "distinction", and "definition") is a concise, terse, [[laconic]], and/or memorable expression of a general truth or principle.<ref>[http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=aphorism Definition of ''Aphorism''] from the [[Online Etymology Dictionary]]</ref> They are often handed down by [[tradition]] from generation to generation. The concept is distinct from those of an [[adage]], [[brocard (law)|brocard]], [[chiasmus]], [[epigram]], maxim ([[legal maxim|legal]] or [[maxim (philosophy)|philosophical]]), [[principle]], [[proverb]], and [[saying]]; some of these concepts are species of aphorism.

==History==
The word was first used in the ''[[s:Aphorisms|Aphorisms]]'' of [[Hippocrates]], a long series of [[proposition]]s concerning the symptoms and diagnosis of [[disease]] and the art of healing and [[medicine]].<ref name="EB1911">{{EB1911|inline=y|wstitle=Aphorism|volume=2|page=165}}</ref> The often cited first sentence of this work (see [[Ars longa, vita brevis]]) is:
{{quote|Life is short, art long, opportunity fleeting, experience deceptive, judgment difficult.}}

This aphorism was later applied or adapted to physical science and then morphed into multifarious aphorisms of philosophy, morality, and literature. Presently an aphorism is generally understood to be a concise and [[eloquence|eloquent]] statement of [[truth]].

Aphorisms are distinct from [[axiom]]s. Aphorisms generally originate from experience and [[Norm (social)|custom]], whereas axioms are self-evident truths and therefore require no additional proof. Aphorisms have been especially used in subjects to which no methodical or scientific treatment was originally applied, such as [[agriculture]], [[medicine]], [[jurisprudence]] and [[politics]].<ref name="EB1911"/>

A famous example is:

{{quote|Power tends to corrupt, and absolute power corrupts absolutely. |[[John Dalberg-Acton, 1st Baron Acton|Lord Acton]]}}

==Literature==
Aphoristic collections, sometimes known as [[wisdom literature]], have a prominent place in the canons of several ancient societies, such as the [[Sutra]] literature of [[India]], the [[bible|Biblical]] [[Ecclesiastes]], [[Islam]]ic [[hadith]]s, [[the golden verses of Pythagoras]], [[Hesiod]]'s ''Works and Days'', the Delphic maxims, and [[Epictetus]]' Handbook.  Aphoristic collections also make up an important part of the work of some modern authors. A 1559 oil–on–oak-panel painting, ''[[Netherlandish Proverbs]]'' (also called ''The Blue Cloak'' or ''The Topsy Turvy World'') by [[Pieter Bruegel the Elder]], artfully depicts a land populated with literal renditions of Flemish aphorisms ([[proverb]]s) of the day.

The first noted published collection of aphorisms is ''[[Adagia]]'' by [[Erasmus]]. Other important early aphorists were [[Baltasar Gracián]], [[François de La Rochefoucauld (writer)|François de La Rochefoucauld]] and [[Blaise Pascal]].

Two influential collections of aphorisms published in the twentieth century were ''The Uncombed Thoughts'' by [[Stanisław Jerzy Lec]] (in Polish), and ''Itch of Wisdom'' by [[Mikhail Turovsky]] (in Russian and English).<ref>{{cite web|author=Заголовок: |url=http://www.peoples.ru/art/painter/turovskiy/ |script-title=ru:ЗАЛОЖНИК ВЕЧНОСТИ Михаил Туровский/ЗАЛОЖНИК ВЕЧНОСТИ Михаил Туровский |publisher=Peoples.ru |date=2003-06-30 |accessdate=2013-10-15|language=ru}}</ref>

==Society==
Many societies have traditional sages or [[culture hero]]es to whom aphorisms are commonly attributed, such as the [[Seven Sages of Greece]], [[Confucius]] or [[King Solomon]].

Misquoted or misadvised aphorisms are frequently used as a source of humour; for instance, wordplays of aphorisms appear in the works of [[P. G. Wodehouse]], [[Terry Pratchett]] and [[Douglas Adams]]. Aphorisms being misquoted by sports players, coaches, and commentators form the basis of [[Private Eye]]'s [[Colemanballs]] section.
