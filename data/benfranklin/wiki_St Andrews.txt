St Andrews has a recorded population of 16,800 in 2011, making it Fife's fourth largest settlement and [[List of towns and cities in Scotland by population|45th most populous settlement in Scotland]].

The town is home to the [[University of St Andrews]], the third oldest university in the [[English-speaking world]] and the oldest in [[Scotland]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/about/history/|title=History {{!}} University of St Andrews|website=www.st-andrews.ac.uk|access-date=2016-06-11}}</ref> According to some rankings, it is ranked as the third best university in the [[United Kingdom]], behind [[Oxbridge]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/education/universityeducation/11153780/The-top-10-universities-in-the-UK-2015.html|title=The top 10 universities in the UK 2015|website=Telegraph.co.uk|access-date=2016-03-16}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/education/ng-interactive/2015/may/25/university-league-tables-2016|title=University league tables 2016|last=Osborn|first=Matt|date=2015-05-25|last2=Franklin|first2=Will|newspaper=The Guardian|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077|last3=Osborn|first3=Matt|last4=Franklin|first4=Will|access-date=2016-03-16}}</ref> The University is an integral part of the burgh and during term time students make up approximately one third of the town's population.{{Citation needed|date=March 2016}} 

The town is named after [[Andrew the Apostle|Saint Andrew]] the [[Twelve apostles|Apostle]]. There has been an important church in St Andrews since at least the 747 AD when it was mentioned in the Annals of Tigernach, and a bishopric since at least the 11th century.{{Citation needed|date=March 2016}} The settlement grew to the west of [[St Andrew's Cathedral, St Andrews|St Andrews cathedral]] with the southern side of the Scores to the north and the Kinness burn to the south. The burgh soon became the ecclesiastical capital of Scotland, a position which was held until the [[Scottish Reformation]]. The famous [[cathedral]], the largest in Scotland, now lies in ruins.

St Andrews is also known worldwide as the "[[home of golf]]". This is in part because [[The Royal and Ancient Golf Club of St Andrews]], founded in 1754, which until 2004<ref>{{Cite journal|date=2017-09-15|title=The Royal and Ancient Golf Club of St Andrews|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=The_Royal_and_Ancient_Golf_Club_of_St_Andrews&oldid=800820074|journal=Wikipedia|language=en}}</ref> exercised legislative authority over the game worldwide (except in the United States and Mexico). It is also because the famous [[St Andrews Links]] (acquired by the town in 1894) are the most frequent venue for [[The Open Championship]], the oldest of [[golf]]'s four [[Men's major golf championships|major championships]]. Visitors travel to St Andrews in great numbers for several courses ranked amongst the finest in the world, as well as for the sandy beaches.

The Martyrs Memorial, erected to the honour of [[Patrick Hamilton (martyr)|Patrick Hamilton]], [[George Wishart]], and other martyrs of the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]] epoch, stands at the west end of the Scores on a cliff overlooking the sea. The civil parish has a population of 18,421 (in 2011).<ref name= KS101SC>Census of Scotland 2011, Table KS101SC – Usually Resident Population, publ. by National Records of Scotland.

The town also contains numerous museums, a botanic garden and an aquarium.

== Name ==
The earliest recorded name of the area is ''Cennrígmonaid''. This is [[Old Irish|Old Gaelic]] and composed of the elements ''cenn'' (head, peninsula), ''ríg'' (king) and ''monaid'' (moor). This became ''Cell Rígmonaid'' (''cell'' meaning church) and was Scoticised to ''Kilrymont''. The modern Gaelic spelling is ''Cill Rìmhinn''. The name ''St Andrews'' derives from the town's claim to be the resting place of bones of the apostle [[Andrew the Apostle|Andrew]]. According to legend, [[St Regulus]] (or Rule) brought the relics to Kilrymont, where a shrine was established for their safekeeping and veneration while Kilrymont was renamed in honour of the saint.<ref>Gifford,J., ''The Buildings of Scotland:Fife'' (Yale UP, 1988), p. 357.</ref> This is the origin of a third name for the town ''Kilrule''.

== History ==
[[File:Hill & Adamson (Scottish, active 1843 - 1848) - St. Regulus Tower and the East Gable of St. Andrews from the Northwest. - Google Art Project.jpg|thumbnail|left|St Andrews Cathedral in 1845]]
The first inhabitants who settled on the estuary fringes of the rivers [[River Tay|Tay]] and [[River Eden, Fife|Eden]] during the mesolithic (middle stone age) came from the plains in Northern Europe between 10,000 and 5,000 BCE.<ref name="Lamont-Brown pp1–2">Lamont-Brown ''St Andrews – City by The Northern Sea'' pp.1–2.</ref> This was followed by the nomadic people who settled around the modern town around 4,500 BCE as farmers clearing the area of woodland and building monuments.<ref name="Lamont-Brown pp1–2" />

In the mid-eighth century a monastery was established by the Pictish king [[Oengus I]], traditionally associated with the relics of [[Andrew the Apostle|Saint Andrew]], a number of bones supposed to be the saints's arm, kneecap, three fingers and a tooth believed to have been brought to the town by St Regulus.<ref name="Gifford p357">Gifford ''Buildings of Scotland – Fife'' p.357.</ref> In AD 877, king [[Causantín mac Cináeda]] (Constantine I or II) built a new church for the Culdees at St Andrews and later the same year was captured and executed (or perhaps killed in battle) after defending against Viking raiders.<ref>Raymond Lamont-Brown, ''St Andrews: City by the Northern Sea'' (Edinburgh: Berlinn, 2006), 9.</ref>

In AD 906, the town became the seat of the bishop of Alba, with the boundaries of the see being extended to include land between the [[River Forth]] and [[River Tweed]].<ref name="Lamont-Brown p16">Lamont-Brown ''St Andrews – City by The Northern Sea'' p.16.</ref> In 940 [[Constantine III of Scotland|Constantine III]] abdicated and took the position of abbot of the monastery of St Andrews.<ref>Gifford, Buildings of Scotland:Fife p.357</ref>

[[File:The Martyrs Memorial, the Scores, St. Andrews Scotland.JPG|thumb|upright|The Martyrs Memorial]]
The establishment of the present town began around 1140 by Bishop Robert on an L-shaped vill, possibly on the site of the ruined [[St Andrews Castle]].<ref name="Lamont-Brown p71">Lamont-Brown ''Fife in History and Legend'' p.71.</ref> According to a charter of 1170, the new burgh was built to the west of the Cathedral precinct, along Castle Street and possibly as far as what is now known as North Street.<ref name="Gifford p357" /> This means that the lay-out may have led to the creation of two new streets (North Street and South Street) from the foundations of the new St Andrews [[Cathedral]] filling the area inside a two-sided triangle at its apex.<ref name="Gifford p357" /> The northern boundary of the burgh was the southern side of the Scores (the street between North Street and the sea) with the southern by the Kinness Burn and the western by the West Port.<ref name="Gifford p359">Gifford ''The Buildings of Scotland: Fife'' p.359.</ref> The burgh of St Andrews was first represented at the great council at [[Scone Palace]] in 1357.<ref name="Gifford p359" />

St Andrews, in particular the large cathedral built in 1160, was the most important centre of pilgrimage in medieval Scotland and one of the most important in Europe. Pilgrims from all over Scotland came in large numbers hoping to be blessed, and in many cases to be cured, at the shrine of Saint Andrew. The presence of the pilgrims brought about increased trade and development.<ref>Omand,D. (ed.) ''The Fife Book'', Birlinn Ltd, 2000, p.118</ref> Recognised as the ecclesiastical capital of Scotland, the town now had vast economic and political influence within Europe as a cosmopolitan town.<ref name="Cook p3">Cook ''Old St Andrews'' p.3.</ref> In 1559, the town fell into decay after the violent [[Scottish Reformation]] and the [[Wars of the Three Kingdoms]] losing the status of ecclesiastical capital of Scotland.<ref name="Lamont-Brown p76">Lamont-Brown ''Fife in History and Legend'' p.76.</ref> Even the University of St Andrews was considering relocating to [[Perth, Scotland|Perth]] around 1697 and 1698.<ref name="Cook p3" /> Under the authorisation of the [[bishop of St Andrews]], the town was made a burgh of barony in 1614. [[Royal Burgh]] was then granted as a charter by King [[James I of England|James VI]] in 1620.<ref name="Lamont-Brown p19">Lamont-Brown ''St Andrews –City by The Northern Sea'' p.19.</ref><ref name="Omand p109">Omand ''The Fife Book'' p.109.</ref> In the 18th century, the town was still in decline, but despite this the town was becoming known for having links 'well known to golfers'.<ref name="Cook p3" /> By the 19th century, the town began to expand beyond the original medieval boundaries with streets of new houses and town villas being built.<ref name="Cook p3" /> Today, St Andrews is served by education, golf and the tourist and conference industry.<ref name="Cook p3" />

== Governance ==
{{further information|History of local government in Scotland}}
[[File:St Andrews Town Hall.jpg|thumb|upright|St Andrews Town Hall]]
St Andrews is represented by several tiers of elected government. The Royal Burgh of St Andrews Community Council, meeting on the first Monday of the month in the Council Chamber of the Town Hall, forms the lowest tier of governance whose statutory role is to communicate local opinion to local and central government. The current Chairman is Mr Callum MacLeod.

Fife Council, the unitary [[local authority]] for St Andrews, based in [[Glenrothes]] is the [[Executive (government)|executive]], [[Deliberation|deliberative]] and [[legislative]] body responsible for [[local government in Scotland|local governance]].<ref name="devolvedmatters">{{cite web|url=http://www.scotlandoffice.gov.uk/what-we-do/reserved-and-devolved-matters.html |title=Reserved and devolved matters |publisher=Scotland Office |accessdate=6 January 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081021065923/http://www.scotlandoffice.gov.uk/what-we-do/reserved-and-devolved-matters.html |archivedate=21 October 2008 }}</ref> The [[Scottish Parliament]] is responsible for [[devolution|devolved matters]] such as [[education in Scotland|education]], [[health in Scotland|health]] and [[Scots law|justice]] while [[reserved matters]] are dealt with by the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland]].<ref name="devolvedmatters" />

The first parliament to take place in the town was in 1304, when King [[Edward I of England|Edward I]] came to be received by [[Bishop William de Lamberton]] as overlordship of Scotland. As many as 130 landowners turned up to witness the event ranging from Sir John of Combo to Sir William Murray of Fort.<ref name="Lamont-Brown p188">Lamont-Brown ''St Andrews – The City By The Northern Sea'' p.188.</ref> In the early days of the [[Acts of Union 1707|union of 1707]], St Andrews elected one member of parliament along with [[Cupar]], [[Perth, Scotland|Perth]], [[Dundee]] and [[Forfar]].<ref name="Lamont-Brown p190">Lamont-Brown ''St Andrews – The City By The Northern Sea'' p.190.</ref> The first elected parliament was introduced on 17 November 1713 as St Andrews Burgh, which merged with [[Anstruther]], the result of a reform bill in 1832.<ref name="Lamont-Brown p190" /> The act of reformation seats in 1855, would find one MP sitting for St Andrews Burgh (which would include Anstruther Easter, Anstruther Wester, [[Crail]], Cupar, [[Kilrenny]] and Pittenweem).<ref name="Lamont-Brown p190" /> Prior to 1975 the town was governed by a council, [[provost (civil)|provost]] and [[baillie]]s. In 1975, St Andrews came under Fife Regional Council and North East Fife District Council. The latter was abolished when a single-tier authority was introduced in 1996 as Fife Council based in [[Glenrothes]].

St Andrews forms part of the [[North East Fife (UK Parliament constituency)|North East Fife]] constituency, electing one [[Member of Parliament]] (MP) to the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] of the Parliament of the United Kingdom by the first past the post system. The constituency is represented by [[Stephen Gethins]], [[Member of Parliament|MP]] of the [[Scottish National Party]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/politics/constituencies/S14000049|title=Fife North East|work=bbc.co.uk|accessdate=8 May 2015}}</ref> For the purposes of the [[Scottish Parliament]], St Andrews forms part of the [[North East Fife (Scottish Parliament constituency)|North East Fife]] constituency. The North East Fife Scottish Parliament (or ''Holyrood'') constituency created in 1999 is one of nine within the Mid Scotland and Fife electoral region. Each constituency elects one [[Member of the Scottish Parliament]] (MSP) by the first past the post system of election, and the region elects seven additional members to produce a form of proportional representation. The seat was won at the [[Scottish Parliament election, 2016|2016 Scottish Parliament Election]] by [[Willie Rennie]], for the [[Scottish Liberal Democrats]].<ref name="Roderick Campbell MSP">{{cite web|url=http://www.parliament.scot/msps/currentmsps/willie-rennie-msp.aspx|title=Willie Rennie MSP|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=Scottish Parliament|access-date=|accessdate=6 September 2016}}</ref><ref name="North East Fife results">{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/election-2016-scotland-36219201|title=Holyrood 2016: Liberal Democrat leader Willie Rennie takes seat from SNP|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=BBC News|access-date=|accessdate=6 September 2016}}</ref>

St Andrews has a [[temperate]] [[maritime climate]], which is relatively mild despite its northerly [[latitude]]. Winters are not as cold as one might expect, considering that Moscow and [[Labrador]] in Newfoundland lie on the same latitude. Daytime temperatures can fall below freezing and average around 4&nbsp;°C. However, the town is subject to strong winds. Night-time frosts are common; however, snowfall is more rare.
The nearest official Met Office weather station for which data are available is at Leuchars, about {{convert|3.3|mi|km}} northwest of St Andrews town centre.

Rainfall, at little more than 650&nbsp;mm per year makes St Andrews one of the driest parts of Scotland, shielded from Atlantic weather systems by several mountain ranges. Over 1&nbsp;mm of rain is recorded on just under 117 days of the year.

Sunshine, averaging in excess of 1,500 hours a year is amongst the highest for Scotland, and comparable to inland parts of Southern England. St Andrews is about the furthest north annual levels of above 1500 hours are encountered.

All averages refer to the 1971–2000 observation period.

== Transport ==
The [[St Andrews Railway]] provided a connection to the main [[Edinburgh to Aberdeen Line]] at [[Leuchars railway station]]. This service was ended in 1969. The [[St Andrews Rail Link]] project aims at realising a new high-speed twin-cord mainline rail link via Cupar to the south and west and via Leuchars to the north.

Nowadays, the only public transport to reach trains at Leuchars or to connect other towns in [[Fife]] is the [[Stagecoach Group|Stagecoach]] bus station located near the town centre. Route 99 (and its alternate routes 99A, 99B, 99C, 99D) connects St Andrews to [[Dundee]] via [[Leuchars]] with buses up to every ten minutes.

[[File:St A's Bandstand.jpg|thumb|right| St Andrew's bandstand]]

The castle was occupied, besieged and stormed during [[The Rough Wooing]] and was severely damaged in the process.

The majority of the castle seen today dates to between 1549 and 1571. The work was commissioned by [[John Hamilton (archbishop of St Andrews)]] in a renaissance style which made the building a comfortable, palatial residence while still remaining well-fortified.<ref name="Walker and Ritchie pp115–116" />
After the Reformation, the castle passed to several owners, who could not maintain its structure and the building deteriorated into a ruin.
The castle is now administered by [[Historic Scotland]]
