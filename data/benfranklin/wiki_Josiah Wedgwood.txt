'''Josiah Wedgwood''' (12 July 1730 – 3 January 1795) was an English [[pottery|potter]] and [[entrepreneur]]. He founded the [[Wedgwood]] company. He is credited with the [[List of industrial processes|industrialisation]] of the manufacture of [[pottery]]; "it was by intensifying the division of labour that Wedgwood brought about the reduction of cost which enabled his pottery to find markets in all parts of Britain, and also of Europe and America."<ref>T. S. Ashton (1948).

Meeting the demands of the consumer revolution and growth in wealth of the middle classes that helped drive the [[Industrial Revolution]] in Britain, Wedgwood is credited as the inventor of modern [[marketing]].<ref name="Black">{{cite news|title=Why the Industrial Revolution Happened Here|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b01pz9d6|publisher=BBC|date=11 January 2017}}</ref> He pioneered [[direct marketing|direct mail]], [[money back guarantee]]s, [[Door-to-door|travelling salesmen]], carrying pattern boxes for display, [[self-service]], free delivery, [[Buy one, get one free|buy one get one free]], and illustrated catalogues.<ref name="Marketing"/>

A prominent [[Abolitionism|abolitionist]], Wedgwood is remembered too for his "''Am I Not a Man And a Brother?''" anti-slavery medallion. He was a member of the [[Darwin–Wedgwood family]], and he was the grandfather of [[Charles Darwin|Charles]] and [[Emma Darwin]].

== Biography ==

=== Early life ===
Born in [[Burslem]], [[Staffordshire]], the eleventh and last child of potter [[Thomas Wedgwood III|Thomas Wedgwood]] (d. 1739) and Mary Wedgwood (''née'' Stringer; d. 1766), Josiah was raised within a family of [[English Dissenters]], he was the grandson of a Unitarian minister and was an active Unitarian. By the age of nine, he was proving himself to be a skilled potter. He survived a childhood bout of [[smallpox]] to serve as an apprentice potter under his eldest brother [[Thomas Wedgwood IV]].<ref name="Distillations">{{cite journal|last1=Meyer|first1=Michal |title=Old Friends|url=https://www.sciencehistory.org/distillations/magazine/old-friends|journal=Distillations|publisher=[[Science History Institute]]|date=2018|volume=4|issue=1|pages=6-9|accessdate=June 26, 2018 }}</ref> Smallpox left Josiah with a permanently weakened knee, which made him unable to work the foot pedal of a [[potter's wheel]]. As a result, he concentrated from an early age on designing pottery and then making it with the input of other potters. The pottery created in his father's and brother's business was inexpensive and low quality, black and mottled in color.<ref name="Distillations"/>

In his early twenties, Wedgwood began working with the most renowned English pottery-maker of his day, [[Thomas Whieldon]], who eventually became his business partner in 1754.  Wedgwood also began to study the new science of [[chemistry]], seeking to understand the [[materials science]] of fire, clay, and minerals and to develop better clays and glazes for potter-making. Following an accident in 1762, Wedgwood met [[Joseph Priestley]], another Dissenter and a chemist who gave Wedgwood advice on chemistry.<ref name="Distillations"/>
Wedgwood's experimentation with a wide variety of techniques coincided with the burgeoning of the nearby industrial city of [[Manchester]]. Inspired, Wedgwood leased the Ivy Works in the town of Burslem. From 1768 to 1780 he partnered with [[Thomas Bentley (manufacturer)|Thomas Bentley]], a potter of sophistication and astute taste.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Thomson|first=Gary|date=November 1995|title=Josiah Wedgwood. (cover story)|url=|journal=Antiques & Collecting Magazine|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}</ref> Over the course of the next decade, his experimentation (and a considerable injection of capital from his marriage to a richly endowed distant cousin) transformed the sleepy artisan works into the first true pottery [[factory]].

=== Marriage and children ===

In January 1764 Wedgwood married Sarah Wedgwood (1734–1815), his third cousin. They had eight children:

* Susannah Wedgwood (3 January 1765 – 1817) married [[Robert Darwin]] and became the mother of the English naturalist [[Charles Darwin]]. Charles married [[Emma Wedgwood]], his cousin. The doubled family inheritance of Wedgwood wealth created by his grandfather gave Charles Darwin the leisure time to formulate his [[theory of evolution]].
* [[John Wedgwood (horticulturist)|John Wedgwood]] (1766–1844)
* Richard Wedgwood (1767–1768) (died as a child)
* [[Josiah Wedgwood II]] (1769–1843) (father of [[Emma Darwin]], cousin and wife of Charles Darwin)
* [[Thomas Wedgwood (photographer)|Thomas Wedgwood]] (1771–1805) (no children)
* Catherine Wedgwood (1774–1823) (no children)

Wedgwood was keenly interested in the scientific advances of his day and it was this interest that underpinned his adoption of its approach and methods to revolutionize the quality of his pottery. His unique glazes began to distinguish his wares from anything else on the market.

By 1763, he was receiving orders from the highest levels of the [[British nobility]], including [[Charlotte of Mecklenburg-Strelitz|Queen Charlotte]]. Wedgwood convinced her to let him name the line of pottery she had purchased "[[Creamware|Queen's Ware]]", and trumpeted the royal association in his paperwork and stationery. Anything Wedgwood made for the Queen was automatically exhibited before it was delivered.<ref name="auto">Neil McKendrick ''Josiah Wedgwood and the Commercialization of the Potteries'', p. 121.</ref> In 1764 he received his first order from abroad. Wedgwood marketed his Queen's Ware at affordable prices, everywhere in the world British trading ships sailed. In 1767 he wrote, "The demand for this sd. Creamcolour, Alias, Queen Ware, Alias, Ivory, still increases -- It is amazing how rapidly the use of it has spread all most [sic] over the whole Globe."<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Thomson|first=Gary|date=November 1995|title=Josiah Wedgwood.

[[File:BLW Tea and coffee service, Staffordshire.jpg|thumb|left|Wedgwood tea and coffee service, 1765, on display at the [[Victoria and Albert Museum]], London. Wedgwood's creamware revolutionised ceramic decoration worldwide.]]
He first opened a warehouse at [[Charles Street, Mayfair]] in London as early as 1765 and it soon became an integral part of his sales organization. In two years his trade had outgrown his rooms in [[Grosvenor Square]].<ref>Neil McKendrick ''Josiah Wedgwood and the Commercialization of the Potteries'', p. 118.</ref> In 1767 Wedgwood and Bentley drew up an agreement to divide decorative wares between them, the domestic wares being sold on Wedgwood's behalf.<ref name="auto1">The Art of Ceramics.

His man had to work day and night to satisfy the demand and the crowds of visitors showed no sign of abating.<ref>Neil McKendrick ''Josiah Wedgwood and the Commercialization of the Potteries'', p. 119.</ref> The proliferating decoration, the exuberant colours, and the universal gilding of [[rococo]] were banished, the splendours of [[baroque]] became distasteful; the intricacies of ''[[chinoiserie]]'' lost their favour. The demand was for purity, simplicity and antiquity.<ref name="auto2">Neil McKendrick ''Josiah Wedgwood and the Commercialization of the Potteries'', p. 114.</ref> To encourage this outward spread of fashion and to speed it on its way Wedgwood set up warehouses and showrooms at Bath, Liverpool and Dublin in addition to his showrooms at Etruria and in [[Westminster]].<ref>Neil McKendrick ''Josiah Wedgwood and the Commercialization of the Potteries'', p. 120.</ref> Great care was taken in timing the openings, and new goods were held back to increase their effect.<ref name="auto"/>

The most important of Wedgwood's early achievements in vase production was the perfection of the black stoneware body, which he called 'basalt'. This body could imitate the colour and shapes of Etruscan or Greek vases which were being excavated in Italy. In 1769 'vases was all the cry' in London; he opened a new factory called [[Etruria Works|Etruria]], north of Stoke. Wedgwood became what he wished to be: 'Vase Maker General to the Universe'.<ref>Neil McKendrick ''Josiah Wedgwood and the Commercialization of the Potteries'', p. 140.</ref> Around 1771 he started to experiment with [[Jasperware]], but he did not advertise this new product for a couple of years.

Sir George Strickland, 6th Baronet was asked for advice on getting models from Rome.<ref>Neil McKendrick ''Josiah Wedgwood and the Commercialization of the Potteries'', p. 110-111.</ref> Gilding was to prove unpopular, and around 1772 Wedgwood reduced the amount of 'offensive gilding' in response to suggestions from [[William Hamilton (diplomat)|Sir William Hamilton]].<ref>The Art of Ceramics. European Ceramic Design 1500-1830 by Howard Coutts, p. 181.</ref>  When English society found the uncompromisingly naked figure of the classics 'too warm' for their taste, and the ardor of the Greek gods too easily apparent, Wedgwood was quick to cloak their pagan immodesty - gowns for the girls and [[Fig leaf|fig leaves]] for the gods were usually sufficient.<ref>Neil McKendrick ''Josiah Wedgwood and the Commercialization of the Potteries'', p. 113.</ref> Just as he felt that his flowerpots would sell more if they were called 'duches of Devonshire flowerpots', his creamware more if called Queensware, so he longed for Brown, [[James Wyatt]], and the [[Robert Adam|brothers Adam]] to lead the architect in the use of his chimney pieces and for George Stubbs to lead the way in the use of Wedgwood plaques.

Wedgwood hoped to monopolize the aristocratic market, and thus win for his wares a special distinction, a social ''cachet'' which would filter to all classes of society. Wedgwood fully realized the value of such a lead and made the most of it by giving his pottery the name of its patron; Queensware, Royal Pattern, Russian pattern, [[Duke of Bedford|Bedford]], Oxford and [[Viscount Chetwynd|Chetwynd]] vases for instance. Whether they owned the original or merely possessed a Wedgwood copy mattered little to Wedgwood's customers.<ref>Neil McKendrick ''Josiah Wedgwood and the Commercialization of the Potteries'', p. 112.</ref> In 1773 they published the first ''Ornamental Catalogue'', an illustrated catalogue of shapes.<ref name="auto1"/> A plaque, in Wedgwood's blue pottery style, marking the site of his London showrooms between 1774 and 1795 in Wedgwood Mews, is located at 12, [[Greek Street]], London, [[W postcode area|W1]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.londonremembers.com/memorials/josiah-wedgwood |title=Plaque: Josiah Wedgwood |publisher=londonremembers.com |year=2013 |accessdate=18 October 2013}}</ref>

In 1773, [[Catherine the Great]] of [[Imperial Russia]] ordered the Green Frog Service from Wedgwood, consisting of 952 pieces and over a thousand original paintings, for one of its palaces — the Kekerekeksinen Palace (''palace on a frog swamp'' {{fi}}), later known as [[Chesme Palace]]. Most of the painting was carried out in Wedgwood's decorating studio at Chelsea.<ref>The Art of Ceramics.

As a leading industrialist, Wedgwood was a major backer of the [[Trent and Mersey Canal]] dug between the [[River Trent]] and [[River Mersey]], during which time he became friends with [[Erasmus Darwin]]. Later that decade, his burgeoning business caused him to move from the smaller Ivy Works to the newly built [[Etruria Works]], which would run for 180 years. The factory was so-named after the [[Etruria]] district of Italy, where black [[porcelain]] dating to [[Etruscan civilization|Etruscan]] times was being excavated. Wedgwood found this porcelain inspiring, and his first major commercial success was its duplication with what he called "Black Basalt". He combined experiments in his art and in the technique of mass production with an interest in improved roads, canals, schools and living conditions. At Etruria, he even built a village for his workers.

Not long after the new works opened, continuing trouble with his smallpox-afflicted knee made necessary the [[amputation]] of his right leg. In 1780, his long-time business partner [[Thomas Bentley (manufacturer)|Thomas Bentley]] died, and Wedgwood turned to Darwin for help in running the business. As a result of the close association that grew up between the Wedgwood and Darwin families, Josiah's eldest daughter would later marry Erasmus' son.

To clinch his position as leader of the new fashion he sought out the famous Barberini vase as the final test of his technical skill.<ref name="auto2"/> Wedgwood's obsession was to duplicate the [[Portland Vase]], a blue and white glass vase dating to the first century BC. For three years he worked on the project, eventually producing what he considered a [[Portland Vase#Copies|satisfactory copy]] in 1789.

In 1784 Wedgwood was exporting nearly 80% of his total produce. By 1790 he had sold to every city in Europe.<ref>Neil McKendrick ''Josiah Wedgwood and the Commercialization of the Potteries'', p. 134-135.</ref>  To give his customers a greater sense of the rarity of his goods, he strictly limited the number of jaspers on display in his rooms at any given time.

After passing on his company to his sons, Wedgwood died at home, probably of cancer of the jaw, in 1795. He was buried three days later in the [[Stoke Minster|parish church of Stoke-on-Trent]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://stokeminster.org/heritage/ |title=History & Heritage |publisher=stokeminster.org/ |year= |accessdate=18 October 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131019163906/http://stokeminster.org/heritage/ |archive-date=19 October 2013 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}</ref> Seven years later a marble memorial tablet commissioned by his sons was installed there.<ref>[http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-z-jXj8PfPzQ/TqL1pzRCuKI/AAAAAAAAG3Q/Uior8ncnYRE/s1600/Stoke+Minster+-+Josiah+Wedgwood+Memorial.jpg]</ref>

One of the wealthiest [[entrepreneurs]] of the 18th century, Wedgwood created goods to meet the demands of the [[consumer]] revolution and growth in wealth of the middle classes that helped drive the [[Industrial Revolution]] in Britain.<ref name="Black"/> He is credited as the inventor of modern [[marketing]], specifically [[direct marketing|direct mail]], [[money back guarantee]]s, [[Door-to-door|travelling salesmen]], carrying pattern boxes for display, [[self-service]], free delivery, [[Buy one, get one free|buy one get one free]], and illustrated catalogues.<ref name="Marketing">{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/10/opinion/10flanders.html?_r=2|title=They Broke It|newspaper= New York Times|date= 9 January 2009}}</ref>  Wedgwood is also noted as an early adopter/founder of managerial accounting principles in Anthony Hopwood's "Archaeology of Accounting Systems."

He was a friend, and commercial rival, of the potter [[Turner (potters)|John Turner the elder]]; their works have sometimes been misattributed.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.thepotteries.org/allpotters/1008.htm |website=thepotteries.org |title=John Turner |accessdate=2 June 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.thepotteries.org/works/hanley/new_hall_works.htm |website=thepotteries.org |title=New Hall Works, Shelton |accessdate=2 June 2016}}</ref> For the further comfort of his foreign buyers he employed French-, German-, Italian- and Dutch-speaking clerks and answered their letters in their native tongue.<ref>Neil McKendrick ''Josiah Wedgwood and the Commercialization of the Potteries'', p. 134.</ref>

Wedgwood belonged to the fourth generation of a family of potters whose traditional occupation continued through another five generations. [[Wedgwood|Wedgwood's company]] is still a famous name in pottery today (as part of Waterford Wedgwood; see [[Waterford Crystal]]), and "Wedgwood China" is sometimes used as a term for his [[Jasperware]], the coloured stoneware with applied relief decoration (usually white), still common throughout the world.

==Abolitionism==
[[File:BLAKE10.JPG|thumb|upright|left|''Am I Not a Man and a Brother?'' Design of the medallion created as part of [[anti-slavery]] campaign by Wedgwood, 1787]]

Wedgwood was a prominent slavery [[abolitionist]]. His friendship with [[Thomas Clarkson]] – abolitionist campaigner and the first historian of the British abolition movement – aroused his interest in slavery. Wedgwood mass-produced cameos depicting the seal for the [[Society for Effecting the Abolition of the Slave Trade]] and had them widely distributed, which thereby became a popular and celebrated image. The Wedgwood medallion was the most famous image of a black person in all of 18th-century art.<ref>{{cite web

From 1787 until his death in 1795, Wedgwood actively participated in the abolition-of-slavery cause.

Thepotteries.org. Retrieved on 2011-01-02.</ref>  Wedgwood reproduced the design in a cameo with the black figure against a white background and donated hundreds to the society for distribution. Thomas Clarkson wrote; "ladies wore them in bracelets, and others had them fitted up in an ornamental manner as pins for their hair. At length the taste for wearing them became general, and thus fashion, which usually confines itself to worthless things, was seen for once in the honorable office of promoting the cause of justice, humanity and freedom".<ref>{{cite web
