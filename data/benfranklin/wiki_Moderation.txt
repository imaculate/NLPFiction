'''Moderation''' is the process of eliminating or lessening extremes.  It is used to ensure [[Assimilation (sociology)|normality]] throughout the medium on which it is being conducted.  Common uses of moderation include:
*Ensuring consistency and accuracy in the marking of [[Test (student assessment)|student assessments]].
*A [[Forum moderator|moderator]] may remove unsuitable contributions from the [[website]], [[Internet forum|forum]] or [[IRC channel]] they represent in accordance with their [[moderation system]].
*A more proactive nuance is found in the [[Methodist]] church's use of the term for the heads of its conferences.
*A [[neutron moderator]] is used to slow down [[neutron]]s in a [[nuclear reactor]].
*A way of life emphasizing perfect amounts of everything, not indulging in too much of one thing, hence moderation.

== History ==

=== Ancient Greece ===

Moderation is also a principle of life. In ancient Greece, the temple of Apollo at [[Delphi]] bore the inscription ''Meden Agan'' ({{lang|grc|μηδὲν ἄγαν}}) - 'Nothing in excess'. Doing something "in moderation" means not doing it excessively. For instance, someone who moderates their food consumption tries to eat all food groups, but limits their intake of those that may cause deleterious effects to harmless levels.

According to the [[history of science and technology|historian]] and [[sociology of science|sociologist of science]] [[Steven Shapin]]:<ref>[[Steven Shapin]], ''Never Pure: Historical Studies of Science as if It Was Produced by People with Bodies, Situated in Time, Space, Culture, and Society, and Struggling for Credibility and Authority'', second edition, [[Johns Hopkins University Press]], 2010, 568 pages, page 245 ({{ISBN|978-0801894213}}).</ref>

=== Christianity ===

Similarly, in [[Christianity]], ''moderationism'' is the position that drinking [[alcoholic beverage]]s temperately is permissible, though [[drunkenness]] is forbidden (see [[Christianity and alcohol]]).

In the [[Book of Wisdom]] moderation is listed among the greatest virtues. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.usccb.org/bible/wisdom/8#7|title=scripture|website=www.usccb.org}}</ref>
===Islam===
{{Main|Wasatiyyah (Islamic term)}}
Wasat, also called wasatiyyah (وسطية) is the [[Arabic]] word for ''best'', ''middle'', ''centered'', ''balanced''. In the [[Islamic]] context, it refers to the ''"middle way"'' or ''"moderation"'', a justly balanced way of life, avoiding extremes and experiencing things in moderation.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Kamali |first1=Mohammad Hashim |title=The Middle Path of Moderation in Islam: The Qurʼānic Principle of Wasaṭiyyah |date=2015 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=9780190226831 |url=https://books.google.com.bd/books?id=HffzCAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Moderation+in+Islam&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiL___UhrrfAhXLqY8KHR0cAgoQ6AEIJjAA#v=onepage&q=Moderation%20in%20Islam&f=false |language=en}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |title=Moderation in Islam: In the Contex[t] of Muslim Community in Singapore : a Compilation of Working Papers Presented in the PERGAS Ulama Convention 2003, Held on 13th and 14th September 2003, which Carried the Theme of Moderation in Islam |date=2004 |publisher=PERGAS |isbn=9789810510329 |url=https://books.google.com.bd/books?id=R__XAAAAMAAJ&dq=Moderation+in+Islam&focus=searchwithinvolume&q=Moderation |language=en}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last1=Hashem |first1=Ahmad Omar |title=Moderation in Islam |date=1999 |publisher=United Printing Publishing and Distributing |pages=177 |url=https://books.google.com.bd/books?id=EGnltQEACAAJ&dq=Moderation+in+Islam&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiL___UhrrfAhXLqY8KHR0cAgoQ6AEIOzAE |language=en}}</ref>
[[Islamic Modernism|Moderate Muslims]] adhere to the concept of contextual relativism as a way to grasp meaning from the [[Quran]].

=== Taoism ===

Moderation is considered a key part of one's personal development in Chinese [[Taoist]] philosophy and religion and is one of the three jewels of Taoist thought. There is nothing that cannot be moderated including one's actions, one's desires and even one's thoughts. It is believed that by doing so one achieves a more natural state, faces less resistance in life and recognises one's limits.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.taoism.net/articles/mason/ethics.htm#Moderation|title=Taoist Ethics|website=www.taoism.net}}</ref> Taken to the extreme, moderation is complex and can be difficult to not only accept, but also understand and implement. It can also be recursive in that one should moderate how much one moderates (i.e. to not be too worried about moderating everything or not to try too hard in finding a middle ground)

Moderation as a principle of Taoist philosophy turns up in all three of its main texts. 

=== Others ===

Moderation is a characteristic of the [[Sweden|Swedish]] national psyche, more specifically described by the Swedish synonym [[Lagom]]. 

In an [[internet forum]] a moderator is one who enforces the rules.
