}} Quote: Montreal "is second only to Paris as the largest primarily French-speaking city in the world".</ref><ref>Kinshasa and Abidjan are sometimes said to rank ahead of Montreal as francophone cities, since they have larger populations and are in countries with French as the sole official language.

===Early European settlement (1600–1760)===
Seventy years later, the French explorer [[Samuel de Champlain]] reported that the St&nbsp;Lawrence Iroquoians and their settlements had disappeared altogether from the St&nbsp;Lawrence valley. This is believed to be due to outmigration, epidemics of European diseases, or intertribal wars.<ref name="Tremblay"/><ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=T3NQ1lsaHs0C&pg=PA214 Bruce G.

[[File:Capitulation Montreal.jpg|thumb|French authorities surrender the city of Montreal to the British after the [[Articles of Capitulation of Montreal|Articles of Capitulation]] was signed in 1760.]]
[[Jérome le Royer de la Dauversiere|Dauversiere]] hired [[Paul Chomedey de Maisonneuve]], then 30, to lead a group of colonists to build a mission on his new seigneury. The colonists left France in 1641 for Quebec, and arrived on the island the following year. On May 17, 1642, Ville-Marie was founded on the southern shore of Montreal island, with Maisonneuve as its first governor. The settlement included a chapel and a hospital, under the command of [[Jeanne Mance]].<ref name="Miquelon">{{cite web|url=https://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.com/en/article/ville-marie-colony/|title=Ville-Marie (Colony)|last=Miquelon|first=Dale|publisher=[[The Canadian Encyclopedia]]|accessdate=March 29, 2009}}</ref> By 1643, Ville-Marie had already been attacked by Iroquois raids. In the spring of 1651, the Iroquois attacks became so frequent and so violent that Ville Marie thought its end had come. Maisonneuve made all the settlers take refuge in the fort. By 1652 the colony at Montreal had been so reduced that he was forced to return to France to raise 100 volunteers to go with him to the colony the following year. If the effort had failed, Montreal was to be abandoned and the survivors re-located downriver to Quebec City. Before these 100 arrived in the fall of 1653, the population of Montreal was barely 50 people.

By 1685 Ville Marie was home to some 600 colonists, most of them living in modest wooden houses. Ville Marie became a centre for the [[fur trade]] and a base for further [[French colonization of the Americas|exploration]].<ref name="Miquelon"/> In 1689 the English-allied Iroquois attacked [[Lachine massacre|Lachine]] on the Island of Montreal, committing the worst massacre in the history of New France.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=L6yBv0obAV4C|title=Battlefields of Canada|last=Beacock Fryer|first=Mary|year=1986|publisher=Dundurn Press Ltd|isbn=1-55002-007-2|page=247|accessdate=November 26, 2011}}</ref> By the early 18th century, the [[Sulpician Order]] was established there. To encourage French settlement, they wanted the Mohawk to move away from the fur trading post at Ville Marie. They had a mission village, known as [[Kahnewake]], south of the St Lawrence River. The fathers persuaded some Mohawk to make a new settlement at their former hunting grounds north of the Ottawa River. This became [[Kanesatake]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nfb.ca/film/kanehsatake_270_years_of_resistance/ |title=Alanis Obomsawin, ''Kanesatake: 270 Years of Resistance'', National Film Board of Canada, 1993, accessed Jan 30, 2010 |publisher=National Film Board of Canada |date=February 5, 2010 |accessdate=April 13, 2010}}</ref> In 1745 several Mohawk families moved upriver to create another settlement, known as [[Akwesasne]].

In the 19th century maintaining Montreal's drinking water became increasingly difficult with the rapid increase in population. A majority of the drinking water was still coming from the city's harbor, which was busy and heavily trafficked leading to the deterioration of the water within. In the mid 1840s the City of Montreal installed a water system that would pump water from the St. Lawrence and into cisterns. The cisterns would then be transported to the desired location. This was not the first water system of its type in Montreal as there had been one in private ownership since 1801. In the middle of the 19th century water distribution was carried out by "fontainiers". The fountainiers would open and close water valves outside of buildings, as directed, all over the city. As they lacked modern plumbing systems it was impossible to connect all buildings at once and it also acted as a conservation method. The population was not finished rising yet however, from 58,000 in 1852 it rose to 267,000 by 1901.<ref>Anderson, Letty. "Water-supply." Building Canada: A History of Public Works. By Norman R. Ball.

Montreal was the capital of the [[Province of Canada]] from 1844 to 1849, but lost its status when a [[Tories#Canada|Tory]] mob [[Burning of the Parliament Buildings in Montreal|burnt down the Parliament]] building to protest the passage of the [[Rebellion Losses Bill]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.vehiculepress.com/montreal/oldmontreal.html |title=Walking Tour of Old Montreal |work=Vehicule Press |accessdate=January 30, 2008}}</ref> For strategic reasons, Queen Victoria herself established [[Ottawa]] as the capital. The reasons were twofold; as it was located more in the interior of the nation, it was less susceptible to US attack. Perhaps more importantly, as it lay on the border between French and English Canada, the small town of Ottawa was seen as a compromise between Montreal, Toronto, Kingston and Quebec City, who were all vying to become the young nation's official capital.

Montreal was [[Montreal Merger|merged]] with the 27 surrounding municipalities on the [[Island of Montreal]] on January 1, 2002, creating a unified city covering the entire island. There was great resistance from the suburbs to the merger, with the perception being that it was forced on the mostly English suburbs by the [[Parti Québécois]]. As expected, this move proved unpopular and several mergers were later rescinded. Several former municipalities, totalling 13% of the population of the island, voted to leave the unified city in separate [[referendum]]s in June 2004. The demerger took place on January 1, 2006, leaving 15 municipalities on the island, including Montreal. De-merged municipalities remain affiliated with the city through an agglomeration council that collects taxes from them to pay for numerous shared services.<ref name="Agglomeration council">{{cite web |title=Agglomeration council |url=http://ville.montreal.qc.ca/portal/page?_pageid=5977,42239628&_dad=portal&_schema=PORTAL |publisher=Ville de Montréal |accessdate=November 23, 2010}}</ref> The 2002 mergers were not the first in the city's history. Montreal annexed 27 other cities, towns, and villages beginning with [[Mercier–Hochelaga-Maisonneuve#History|Hochelaga]] in 1883 with the last prior to 2002 being [[Pointe-aux-Trembles]] in 1982.

The 21st century has brought with it a revival of the city's economic and cultural landscape. The construction of new residential skyscrapers, two super-hospitals (the [[Centre hospitalier de l'Université de Montréal]] and [[McGill University Health Centre]]), the creation of the [[Quartier des Spectacles]], reconstruction of the [[Turcot Interchange]], reconfiguration of the Decarie and Dorval interchanges, construction of the new [[Réseau électrique métropolitain]], gentrification of [[Griffintown]], subway line extensions and the purchase of new subway cars, the complete revitalization and expansion of [[Montreal-Trudeau International Airport|Trudeau International Airport]], the completion of [[Quebec Autoroute 30]], the reconstruction of the [[Champlain Bridge, Montreal|Champlain Bridge]], and the construction of a new toll bridge to Laval are helping Montreal continue to grow.{{Citation needed|date=May 2015}}

===Climate===
Montreal is classified as a [[humid continental climate|humid continental]] climate ([[Köppen climate classification]]: Dfa/Dfb).<ref name="Köppen">{{cite web|url = http://geogratis.gc.ca/api/en/nrcan-rncan/ess-sst/09ffaeb5-ec8f-5bb5-bdcb-3436ccf26f58.html |title = Climatic Regions [Köppen] |work = Atlas of Canada |publisher = Natural Resources Canada |date = June 2003|accessdate = September 28, 2013}}</ref><ref name="Climate-Data.org">{{cite web|title=Climate: Montreal – Climate graph, Temperature graph, Climate table|url=http://en.climate-data.org/location/3704/|publisher=Climate-Data.org|accessdate=September 13, 2013}}</ref>
Summers are, on the whole, warm and humid with a daily maximum average of {{convert|26|to|27|°C|°F|0}} in July; temperatures in excess of {{convert|30|°C|0|abbr=on}} are common. Conversely, cold fronts can bring crisp, drier and windy weather in the early and later parts of summer.
[[File:Montreal Winter Snowing.jpg|thumb|Winters in Montreal bring cold, snowy, windy, and at times, icy weather.]]
Winter brings cold, snowy, windy, and, at times, icy weather, with a daily average ranging from {{convert|-9|to|-10.5|°C|°F|0}} in January. However, some winter days rise above freezing, allowing for rain on an average of 4 days in January and February each. Usually, snow covering some or all bare ground lasts on average from the first or second week of December until the last week of March.<ref name="CurrentResults.com">{{cite web|title=Montréal Snowfall Totals & Accumulation Averages|url=http://www.currentresults.com/Weather/Canada/Quebec/Places/montreal-snowfall-totals-snow-accumulation-averages.php|accessdate=July 28, 2014}}</ref> While the air temperature does not fall below {{convert|-30|°C}} every year,<ref name="Montreal Weather Data">{{cite web|title=Montréal Weather over the Last 5 Years|url=http://montreal.weatherstats.ca/periods/5years.html|accessdate=July 28, 2014}}</ref> the [[wind chill]] often makes the temperature feel this low to exposed skin.

However, snow can fall in early to mid-October as well as early to mid-May on rare occasions.

The lowest temperature in Environment Canada's books was {{convert|−37.8|°C|0}} on January 15, 1957, and the highest temperature was {{convert|37.6|°C|abbr=on}} on August 1, 1975, both at [[Montréal–Pierre Elliott Trudeau International Airport|Dorval International Airport]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.climate.weatheroffice.gc.ca/climate_normals/results_1961_1990_e.html?stnID=1191&prov=QC&lang=e&StationName=MONTREAL&SearchType=Contains&province=ALL&provBut=&month1=0&month2=12|title=Canadian Climate Normals 1961–1990 Station Data|work=weatheroffice.gc.ca}}</ref>

Annual precipitation is around {{convert|1000|mm|0|abbr=on}}, including an average of about {{convert|210|cm|in|0|abbr=on}} of snowfall, which occurs from November through March. Thunderstorms are common in the period beginning in late spring through summer to early fall; additionally, tropical storms or their remnants can cause heavy rains and gales. Montreal averages 2,050 hours of sunshine annually, with summer being the sunniest season, though slightly wetter than the others in terms of total precipitation—mostly from thunderstorms.<ref name="PET stats">.{{cite web

==Architecture==
{{Main|Architecture of Montreal}}
[[File:Vieux-Montréal (525744602).jpg|thumb|Many colonial era buildings can be found in [[Old Montreal]] with several dating as far back as the late 17th century.]]
For over a century and a half, Montreal was the industrial and financial centre of Canada.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://digital.library.mcgill.ca/industrial/intro.html|title=Welcome to Industrial Montreal|publisher=[[McGill University]]|accessdate=February 26, 2009}}</ref> This legacy has left a variety of buildings including factories, [[Grain elevators|elevators]], [[warehouses]], [[mill (factory)|mills]], and [[refineries]], that today provide an invaluable insight into the city's history, especially in the downtown area and the Old Port area. There are 50 [[List of National Historic Sites of Canada in Montreal|National Historic Sites of Canada]], more than any other city.<ref>{{cite web|title=Montréal|url=http://www.pc.gc.ca/apps/lhn-nhs/page3_E.asp?locateinp=Montr%E9al&nhsprov=Quebec&nhschoice=nhsdesig&list4=Generate+List|work=Directory of Designations of National Historic Significance of Canada|publisher=[[Parks Canada]]|accessdate=July 31, 2011}}{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>

Some of the city's earliest still-standing buildings date back to the late 17th and early 18th centuries. Although most are clustered around the Old Montreal area, such as the Sulpician Seminary adjacent to Notre Dame Basilica that dates back to 1687, and Château Ramezay, which was built in 1705, examples of early colonial architecture are dotted throughout the city. Situated in Lachine, the Le Ber-Le Moyne House is the oldest complete building in the city. In Point St. Charles visitors can see the Maison Saint-Gabriel, which can trace its history back to 1698.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.taylornoakes.com/2013/01/01/the-oldest-buildings-in-montreal/|title=The Oldest Buildings in Montréal|first=Taylor C.|last=Noakes|date=January 1, 2013|publisher=}}</ref> There are many historic buildings in Old Montreal in their original form: [[Notre-Dame de Montréal Basilica|Notre Dame of Montreal Basilica]], [[Bonsecours Market]], and the 19th‑century headquarters of all major Canadian banks on [[Saint Jacques Street|St. James Street]] (French: Rue Saint Jacques). Montreal's earliest buildings are characterized by their uniquely French influence and grey stone construction.
[[File:Habitat-67 side view with holes visible in the structure.jpg|thumb|left|[[Habitat 67]] is a model community and housing complex developed for [[Expo 67]] [[World Fair]].]]
[[Saint Joseph's Oratory]], completed in 1967, [[Ernest Cormier]]'s [[Art Deco]] [[Université de Montréal]] main building, the landmark [[Place Ville Marie]] office tower, the controversial [[Olympic Stadium (Montreal)|Olympic Stadium]] and surrounding structures, are but a few notable examples of the city's 20th-century architecture. Pavilions designed for the 1967 International and Universal Exposition, popularly known as [[Expo&nbsp;67]], featured a wide range of architectural designs. Though most pavilions were temporary structures, several have become landmarks, including Buckminster Fuller's [[geodesic dome]] U.S.&nbsp;Pavilion, now the [[Montreal Biosphere]], and [[Moshe Safdie]]'s striking [[Habitat&nbsp;67]] apartment complex.

The [[Montreal Metro]] has public artwork by some of the biggest names in [[Culture of Quebec|Quebec culture]].

In 2006 Montreal was named a [[UNESCO]] City of Design, only one of three design capitals of the world (the others being [[Berlin]] and [[Buenos Aires]]).<ref name="UNESCO"/> This distinguished title recognizes Montreal's design community.

The [[Underground City, Montreal|Underground City]] (officially RESO) is an important tourist attraction. It is the set of interconnected shopping complexes (both above and below ground). This impressive network connects pedestrian thoroughfares to universities, as well as hotels, restaurants, bistros, subway stations and more, in and around downtown with {{convert|32|km|mi|abbr=off}} of tunnels over {{convert|12|km2|sqmi|spell=in|lk=out|abbr=off}} of the most densely populated part of Montreal.

==Neighbourhoods==
{{Main|List of neighbourhoods in Montreal}}
{{See also|Boroughs of Montreal}}
[[File:ArrondissementsQuartiersMontreal.svg|thumb|275px|Map of neighbourhoods on the island of Montreal.]]
The city is composed of 19 large [[Boroughs of Montreal|boroughs]], subdivided into neighbourhoods.<ref name="Bits">{{cite web|url=http://www.montrealbits.com/neighbourhoods.html|title=Neighbourhoods|date=2005–2009|work=Gromco, Inc.|publisher=Montreal Bits|accessdate=March 25, 2009}}</ref>
The boroughs are:
[[Côte-des-Neiges–Notre-Dame-de-Grâce|Côte-des-Neiges–Notre-Dame-de-Grace]], [[Le Plateau-Mont-Royal|The Plateau Mount Royal]], [[Outremont (borough)|Outremont]] and [[Ville-Marie (Montreal)|Ville Marie]] in the centre; [[Mercier–Hochelaga-Maisonneuve]], [[Rosemont–La Petite-Patrie]] and [[Villeray–Saint-Michel–Parc-Extension]] in the east; [[Anjou (borough)|Anjou]], [[Montréal-Nord]], [[Rivière-des-Prairies–Pointe-aux-Trembles]] and [[Saint-Leonard, Quebec|Saint-Leonard]] in the northeast; [[Ahuntsic-Cartierville]], [[L'Île-Bizard–Sainte-Geneviève]], [[Pierrefonds-Roxboro]] and [[Saint-Laurent (borough)|Saint-Laurent]] in the northwest; and [[Lachine (borough)|Lachine]], [[LaSalle (borough)|LaSalle]], [[Le Sud-Ouest|The South West]] and [[Verdun (borough)|Verdun]] in the south.

Many of these boroughs were independent cities that were forced to be merged with Montreal in January 2002 following the [[2002-2006 municipal reorganization of Montreal|2002 Municipal Reorganization of Montreal]].
[[File:Montreal August 2017 05.jpg|thumb|left|A view of [[Downtown Montreal]] from [[Mont Royal]]. Many neighbourhoods, including downtown, are located in the borough of [[Ville-Marie, Montreal|Ville-Marie]].]]
The borough with the most neighbourhoods is Ville Marie, which includes [[Downtown Montreal|downtown]], the historical district of [[Old Montreal]], [[Chinatown (Montreal)|Chinatown]], the [[Gay Village, Montreal|Gay Village]], the [[Quartier Latin, Montreal|Latin Quarter]], the gentrified [[Quartier international de Montréal|Quartier international]] and [[Cité Multimédia]] as well as the [[Quartier des Spectacles]] which is under development. Other neighbourhoods of interest in the borough include the affluent [[Golden Square Mile]] neighbourhood at the foot of [[Mount Royal]] and the [[Shaughnessy Village]]/[[Quartier Concordia|Concordia U]] area home to thousands of students at [[Concordia University (Montreal)|Concordia University]]. The borough also comprises most of [[Mount Royal Park]], [[Saint Helen's Island]], and [[Île Notre-Dame|Notre-Dame Island]].

The [[Plateau]] Mount Royal borough was a working class francophone area. The largest neighbourhood is [[the Plateau]] (not to be confused with the whole borough), which is undergoing considerable gentrification,<ref>{{cite web|last=Barbonne|first=Rémy|title=Gentrification, nouvel urbanisme et évolution de la mobilité quotidienne : vers un développement plus durable ?

The [[McGill Ghetto]] is in the extreme southwestern portion of the borough, its name being derived from the fact that it is home to thousands of [[McGill University]] students and faculty members.

The South West borough was home to much of the city's industry during the late 19th and early-to-mid 20th century. The borough included [[Goose Village, Montreal|Goose Village]] and is home to the traditionally working-class [[Irish Quebecer|Irish]] neighbourhoods of [[Griffintown]] and [[Pointe-Saint-Charles|Point Saint Charles]] as well as the low-income neighbourhoods of [[Saint-Henri|Saint Henri]] and [[Little Burgundy]].

Other notable neighbourhoods include the multicultural areas of [[Notre-Dame-de-Grâce]] and [[Côte-des-Neiges]] in the Côte-des-Neiges–Notre-Dame-de-Grace borough, and [[Little Italy, Montreal|Little Italy]] in the borough of Rosemont–La Petite-Patrie and [[Hochelaga-Maisonneuve]], home of the [[Olympic Stadium, Montreal|Olympic Stadium]] in the borough of Mercier–Hochelaga-Maisonneuve.

===Old Montreal===
{{Main|Old Montreal}}
[[File:Place Jacques-Cartier Jan 2006.jpg|thumb|[[Place Jacques-Cartier]] is a major [[public square]] and attraction in [[Old Montreal]].]]
Old Montreal is a historic area southeast of downtown containing many attractions such as the [[Old Port of Montreal]], [[Place Jacques-Cartier]], [[Montreal City Hall]], the [[Bonsecours Market]], Place d'Armes, [[Pointe-à-Callière Museum]], the [[Notre-Dame de Montréal Basilica]], and the [[Montreal Science Centre]].

Architecture and cobbled streets in Old Montreal have been maintained or restored and are frequented by horse-drawn [[calèche|buggies]] carrying tourists. Old Montreal is accessible from the downtown core via the [[underground city, Montreal|underground city]] and is served by several [[Société de transport de Montréal|STM]] bus routes and Metro stations, ferries to the South Shore and a network of bicycle paths.

The riverside area adjacent to Old Montreal is known as the Old Port. The Old Port was the site of the [[Port of Montreal]], but its shipping operations have been moved to a larger site downstream, leaving the former location as a recreational and historical area maintained by [[Parks Canada]]. The new Port of Montreal is Canada's largest container port and the largest inland port on Earth.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.port-montreal.com/news/fr_62_1.pdf|title=The Growing Importance of the Container Trade for the Port of Montreal and the Accompanying Business Concentration; How to Diversify its Operational and Financial Risk|last=Taddeo|first=D.J.|date=December 23, 1996|publisher=[[Port of Montreal]]|accessdate=August 3, 2008|format=PDF|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080819220327/http://www.port-montreal.com/news/fr_62_1.pdf|archivedate=August 19, 2008|df=mdy-all}}</ref>

===Mount Royal===
{{Main|Mount Royal}}
The mountain is the site of Mount Royal Park, one of Montreal's largest [[Open space reserve|greenspaces]]. The park, most of which is wooded, was designed by [[Frederick Law Olmsted]], who also designed New York's [[Central Park]], and was inaugurated in 1876.<ref name="LesAmisDeLaMontagne">{{cite web|url=http://www.lemontroyal.qc.ca/en/learn-about-mount-royal/short-history-of-mount-royal.sn|title=Short History of Mount Royal|last=Berryman |first=Tom|publisher=Les amis de la montagne|accessdate=February 26, 2009}}</ref>
[[File:Mtroyal.jpg|thumb|left|View of [[Mont-Royal]]'s eastern slope from the [[George-Étienne Cartier]] monument. The park is one of Montreal's largest [[open space reserve]]s.]]
The park contains two [[belvedere (structure)|belvederes]], the more prominent of which is the Kondiaronk Belvedere, a semicircular plaza with a [[chalet]] overlooking Downtown Montreal. Other features of the park are Beaver Lake, a small man-made lake, a short [[skiing|ski]] [[Ski slope|slope]], a [[sculpture garden]], Smith House, an [[interpretive centre]], and a well-known monument to Sir [[George-Étienne Cartier]]. The park hosts athletic, tourist and cultural activities.

The mountain is home to two major cemeteries, Notre-Dame-des-Neiges (founded in 1854) and Mount Royal (1852). [[Mount Royal Cemetery]] is a {{convert|165|acre|ha}} terraced cemetery on the north slope of Mount Royal in the borough of Outremont. [[Notre Dame des Neiges Cemetery]] is much larger, predominantly French-Canadian and officially Catholic.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cimetierenddn.org/en/cemetery/mission.aspx |title=Notre-Dame-des-Neiges Cemetery Mission |publisher=Cimetière Notre-Dame-des-Neiges |accessdate=September 1, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091223013938/http://www.cimetierenddn.org/en/cemetery/mission.aspx |archivedate=December 23, 2009 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> More than 900,000 people are buried there.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lemontroyal.qc.ca/carte/en/html//The-cemeteries-of-Mount-Royal-38.html|title=The cemeteries of Mount Royal|publisher=Les amis de la montagne |accessdate=February 26, 2009}}</ref>

Mount Royal Cemetery contains more than 162,000 graves and is the final resting place for a number of notable Canadians. It includes a veterans section with several soldiers who were awarded the [[British Empire]]'s highest military honour, the [[Victoria Cross]]. In 1901 the Mount Royal Cemetery Company established the first crematorium in Canada.<ref name="MountRoyalCemetery">{{cite web|url=http://www.mountroyalcem.com/index.php/en/canadas-first-crematorium.html|title=Mount Royal Crematorium|year=2010|publisher=[[Mount Royal Cemetery]]|accessdate=August 12, 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130117011634/http://mountroyalcem.com/index.php/en/canadas-first-crematorium.html|archivedate=January 17, 2013|df=mdy-all}}</ref>

The first [[Mount Royal Cross|cross]] on the mountain was placed there in 1643 by [[Paul Chomedey de Maisonneuve]], the founder of the city, in fulfilment of a vow he made to the [[Mary, mother of Jesus|Virgin Mary]] when [[prayer|praying]] to her to stop a disastrous flood.<ref name="LesAmisDeLaMontagne"/> Today, the mountain is crowned by a 31.4 m-high (103&nbsp;ft) illuminated cross, installed in 1924 by the [[Société Saint-Jean-Baptiste|John the Baptist Society]] and now owned by the city.<ref name="LesAmisDeLaMontagne"/> It was converted to [[optical fibre|fibre optic]] light in 1992.<ref name="LesAmisDeLaMontagne"/> The new system can turn the lights red, blue, or purple, the last of which is used as a sign of mourning between the death of the Pope and the election of the next.<ref name="Hour">{{cite web|url=http://www.hour.ca/news/brief.aspx?iIDArticle=3438|title=The future of the Mount Royal cross|last=Silverman|first=Craig|date=June 14, 2004|publisher=[[Hour (magazine)|Hour]]|accessdate=February 26, 2009|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100105013920/http://www.hour.ca/news/brief.aspx?iIDArticle=3438|archivedate=January 5, 2010|df=mdy-all}}</ref>

==Culture==
{{Main|Culture of Montreal}}
Montreal was referred to as "Canada's Cultural Capital" by [[Monocle (2007 magazine)|''Monocle'' magazine]].<ref name="Monocle"/> The city is Canada's centre for French-language television productions, radio, theatre, film, multimedia, and print publishing. Montreal's many cultural communities have given it a distinct local culture.
[[File:Montreal Clock Tower, Fireworks.jpg|left|thumb|[[L'International des Feux Loto-Québec|Montreal Fireworks Festival]] is the world's largest annual fireworks festival. The city hosts a number of festivals annually.]]
As a [[North American]] city, Montreal shares many cultural characteristics with the rest of the continent. It has a tradition of producing both jazz and rock music. The city has also produced much talent in the fields of visual arts, theatre, music, and dance. Yet, being at the confluence of the French and the English traditions, Montreal has developed a unique and distinguished cultural face. Another distinctive characteristic of cultural life is the animation of its [[Downtown Montreal|downtown]], particularly during summer, prompted by cultural and social events, particularly festivals. The city's largest festival is the [[Montreal International Jazz Festival]], which is the largest jazz festival in the world. Other popular festivals include the [[Just for Laughs]] (largest comedy festival in the world), [[Montreal World Film Festival]], [[Les FrancoFolies de Montréal]], [[Nuits d'Afrique]], [[Pop Montreal]], [[Divers/Cité]], [[Fierté Montréal]] and the [[Montreal Fireworks Festival]]. There are many smaller festivals, totalling over 100 each year in Montreal.

A cultural heart of classical art and the venue for many summer festivals, the [[Place des Arts]] is a complex of different concert and theatre halls surrounding a large square in the eastern portion of downtown. Place des Arts has the headquarters of one of the world's foremost orchestras, the [[Montreal Symphony Orchestra]]. The [[Orchestre Métropolitain du Grand Montréal]] and the chamber orchestra [[I Musici de Montréal]] are two other well-regarded Montreal orchestras. Also performing at Place des Arts are the [[Opéra de Montréal]] and the city's chief ballet company [[Les Grands Ballets Canadiens]]. Internationally recognized avant-garde dance troupes such as [[Compagnie Marie Chouinard]], [[La La La Human Steps]], [[O Vertigo]], and the [[Jean-Pierre Perreault|Fondation Jean-Pierre Perreault]] have toured the world and worked with international popular artists on videos and concerts. The unique choreography of these troupes has paved the way for the success of the world-renowned [[Cirque du Soleil]].

Nicknamed ''{{lang|fr|la ville aux cent clochers}}'' (the city of a hundred steeples), Montreal is renowned for its churches. As [[Mark Twain]] noted, "This is the first time I was ever in a city where you couldn't throw a brick without breaking a church window."<ref>{{cite news |first=Mark |last=Twain |title=MARK TWAIN IN MONTREAL |url=http://www.twainquotes.com/18811210.html |work=New York Times |publisher=twainquotes.com |date=December 10, 1881 |accessdate=February 2, 2008}}</ref> The city has four Roman Catholic [[basilica]]s: [[Mary, Queen of the World Cathedral]], the aforementioned [[Notre-Dame de Montréal Basilica|Notre-Dame Basilica]], [[St. Patrick's Basilica, Montreal|St Patrick's Basilica]], and [[Saint Joseph's Oratory]].

===Sports===
{{Main|Sports in Montreal}}
The most popular sport is [[ice hockey]]. The professional hockey team, the [[Montreal Canadiens]], is one of the [[Original Six]] teams of the [[National Hockey League]] (NHL), and has won an NHL-record 24 [[Stanley Cup]] championships. The Canadiens' most recent Stanley Cup victory came in [[1993 Stanley Cup Finals|1993]]. They have major rivalries with the [[Toronto Maple Leafs]] and [[Boston Bruins]], both of which are also Original Six hockey teams, and with the [[Ottawa Senators]], the closest team geographically. The Canadiens have played at the [[Bell Centre]] since 1996. Prior to that they played at the [[Montreal Forum]].
[[File:CentreBell.jpg|thumb|left|Opened in 1996, the [[Bell Centre]] is a sports and entertainment complex, and also serves as the home arena for the [[Montreal Canadiens]].]]
The [[Montreal Alouettes]] of the [[Canadian Football League]] (CFL) play at [[Molson Stadium]] on the campus of [[McGill University]] for their regular-season games. Late season and playoff games are played at the much larger, enclosed Olympic Stadium, which also played host to the [[2008 Grey Cup]]. The Alouettes have won the Grey Cup seven times, most recently in [[98th Grey Cup|2010]]. The Alouettes has had two periods on hiatus. During the second one, the [[Montreal Machine]] played in the [[World League of American Football]] in 1991 and 1992. The [[McGill Redmen]], [[Concordia Stingers]], and [[Université de Montréal]] [[Montreal Carabins|Carabins]] play in the [[CIS football|CIS university football]] league.

Montreal has a storied baseball history. The city was the home of the minor-league [[Montreal Royals]] of the [[International League]] until 1960.

Montreal is the site of a high-profile [[auto racing]] event each year: the [[Canadian Grand Prix]] of [[Formula One]] (F1) racing. This race takes place on the famous [[Circuit Gilles Villeneuve]] on [[Île Notre-Dame]].

==Media==
{{Main|Media in Montreal}}
Montreal is Canada's second-largest media market, and the centre of francophone Canada's media industry.

There are four [[Terrestrial television|over-the-air]] English-language television stations: [[CBMT-DT]] ([[CBC Television]]), [[CFCF-DT]] ([[CTV Television Network|CTV]]), [[CKMI-DT]] ([[Global Television Network|Global]]) and [[CJNT-DT]] ([[City (TV network)|City]]). There are also five over-the-air French-language television stations: [[CBFT-DT]] ([[Télévision de Radio-Canada|Radio-Canada]]), [[CFTM-DT]] ([[TVA (Canada)|TVA]]), [[CFJP-DT]] ([[V (TV network)|V]]), CIVM-DT ([[Télé-Québec]]), and [[CFTU-DT]] (Canal Savoir).

Montreal has three daily newspapers, the English-language ''[[Montreal Gazette]]'' and the French-language ''[[Le Journal de Montréal]]'', and ''[[Le Devoir]]''; another French-language daily, ''[[La Presse (Canadian newspaper)|La Presse]]'', became an online daily in 2018. There are two free French dailies, ''[[Metro International|Métro]]'' and ''[[24 Hours (newspaper)|24 Heures]]''. Montreal has numerous weekly tabloids and community newspapers serving various neighbourhoods, ethnic groups and schools.

==Government==
{{Main|Montreal City Council|Mayor of Montreal}}
The head of the [[city government in Montreal]] is the mayor, who is [[first among equals]] in the city council.
[[File:Hotel de ville de Montreal 03.jpg|thumb|left|Completed in 1878, [[Montreal City Hall]] is the [[Montreal City Council|seat of local government]].]]
The city council is a democratically elected institution and is the final decision-making authority in the city, although much power is centralized in the executive committee. The Council consists of 65 members from all [[Boroughs of Montreal|boroughs]].<ref name="councillors">{{cite web|url=http://ville.montreal.qc.ca/portal/page?_pageid=133,1297433&_dad=portal&_schema=PORTAL|title=City Council|work=City Hall|publisher=Ville de Montréal|accessdate=August 2, 2008}}</ref> The Council has jurisdiction over many matters, including public security, agreements with other governments, subsidy programs, the [[natural environment|environment]], [[urban planning]], and a three-year capital expenditure program. The Council is required to supervise, standardize or approve certain decisions made by the borough councils.

Reporting directly to the council, the executive committee exercises decision-making powers similar to those of the cabinet in a [[parliamentary system]] and is responsible for preparing various documents including [[budget]]s and [[by-law]]s, submitted to the council for approval. The decision-making powers of the executive committee cover, in particular, the awarding of contracts or grants, the management of human and financial resources, supplies and buildings. It may also be assigned further powers by the city council.

Standing committees are the prime instruments for public consultation. They are responsible for the public study of pending matters and for making the appropriate recommendations to the council. They also review the annual budget forecasts for departments under their jurisdiction. A public notice of meeting is published in both French and English daily newspapers at least seven days before each meeting. All meetings include a public question period. The standing committees, of which there are seven, have terms lasting two years. In addition, the City Council may decide to create special committees at any time. Each standing committee is made up of seven to nine members, including a chairman and a vice-chairman. The members are all elected municipal officers, with the exception of a representative of the government of [[Quebec]] on the public security committee.

The city is only one component of the larger [[Greater Montreal|Montreal Metropolitan Community]] (Communauté Métropolitaine de Montréal, CMM), which is in charge of planning, coordinating, and financing economic development, public transportation, garbage collection and [[waste management]], etc., across the metropolitan area. The president of the CMM is the mayor of Montreal. The CMM covers {{convert|4360|km2|sqmi}}, with 3.6&nbsp;million inhabitants in 2006.<ref name="CMM">{{cite web |url= http://www.cmm.qc.ca/index.php?id=334 |title=The CMM at a Glance |work=Statistics |publisher=[[Greater Montreal Area|Montreal Metropolitan Community]] |accessdate=August 2, 2008}}</ref>

Two separate institutions are affiliated to the university: the ''[[École Polytechnique de Montréal]]'' (School of Engineering) and ''[[HEC Montréal]]'' (School of Business). HEC Montreal was founded in 1907 and is considered as one of the best business schools in Canada.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.topmba.com/mba-programs/10-top-business-schools-canada-201415|title=top business schools in Canada}}</ref>
*''[[Université du Québec à Montréal]]'' (''UQaM'') is the Montreal campus of ''[[Université du Québec]]''. ''UQaM'' generally specializes in liberal-arts, although many programs related to the sciences are available.
** The ''[[Université du Québec]]'' network also has three separately run schools in Montréal, notably the ''[[École de technologie supérieure]] (ETS)'', the ''[[École nationale d'administration publique]] (ÉNAP)'' and the ''[[Institut national de la recherche scientifique]] (INRS)''.

==Transportation==
{{Main|Transportation in Montreal}}
[[File:Montreal autoroute.jpg|thumb|Montreal serves as a hub for Quebec's [[Autoroutes of Quebec|autoroute]] system of [[controlled-access highway]]s.]]
Like many major cities, Montreal has a problem with vehicular traffic congestion. Commuting traffic from the cities and towns in the [[West Island]] (such as [[Dollard-des-Ormeaux]] and [[Pointe-Claire]]) is compounded by commuters entering the city that use twenty-four road crossings from numerous off-island suburbs on the [[North Shore (Laval)|North]] and [[South Shore (Montreal)|South Shores]]. The width of the [[Saint Lawrence River]] has made the construction of fixed links to the south shore expensive and difficult. There are presently four road bridges (including two of the country's busiest) along with one bridge-tunnel, two railway bridges, and a [[Montreal Metro|Metro]] line. The far narrower [[Rivière des Prairies]] to the city's north, separating Montreal from Laval, is spanned by nine road bridges (seven to the city of [[Laval, Quebec|Laval]] and two that span directly to the [[North Shore (Laval)|north shore]]) and a Metro line. The island of Montreal is a hub for the Quebec [[Autoroute (Quebec)|Autoroute]] system, and is served by Quebec Autoroutes [[Quebec Autoroute 10|A-10]] (known as the Bonaventure Expressway on the island of Montreal), [[Quebec Autoroute 15|A-15]] (aka the Decarie Expressway south of the A-40 and the Laurentian Autoroute to the north of it), [[Quebec Autoroute 13|A-13]] (aka Chomedey Autoroute), [[Quebec Autoroute 20|A-20]], [[Quebec Autoroute 25|A-25]], [[Quebec Autoroute 40|A-40]] (part of the [[Trans-Canada Highway]] system, and known as "The Metropolitan" or simply "The Met" in its elevated mid-town section), [[Quebec Autoroute 520|A-520]] and [[Quebec Autoroute 720|A-720]] (aka the Ville-Marie Autoroute). Many of these Autoroutes are frequently congested at [[rush hour]].<ref name="epomm">{{cite web|url=http://www.epomm.org/ecomm2004/workshops/anglais/Brun.pdf |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5lnDvYz4x?url=http://www.epomm.org/ecomm2004/workshops/anglais/Brun.pdf |archivedate=December 5, 2009 |title=The keys to success for Smart Commuting Montreal, the Downtown Montreal Transportation Management Centre |year=2004 |publisher=European Platform on Mobility Management |accessdate=March 26, 2009 |deadurl=yes |df=mdy }}</ref> However, in recent years, the government has acknowledged this problem and is working on long-term solutions to alleviate the congestion. One such example is the extension of [[Quebec Autoroute 30]] on Montreal's [[South Shore (Montreal)|south shore]], which will serve as a [[bypass (road)|bypass]].<ref name="TransportsQuebec">{{cite web|url=http://www.autoroute30.qc.ca/en/a30-objectifs.asp|title=The completion of Autoroute 30|date=August 1, 2008|work=Objectives|publisher=[[Transports Québec]]|accessdate=August 3, 2008|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080316051744/http://autoroute30.qc.ca/en/a30-objectifs.asp|archivedate=March 16, 2008|df=mdy-all}}</ref>

The CPR's flagship train, ''[[The Canadian]]'', ran daily from Windsor Station to [[Vancouver]], but all passenger services have since been transferred to Via Rail Canada. Since 1990, ''[[The Canadian]]'' has terminated in Toronto.

Montreal-based [[Canadian National Railways]] (CN) was formed in 1919 by the Canadian government following a series of country-wide rail bankruptcies. It was formed from the [[Grand Trunk Pacific Railway|Grand Trunk]], Midland and [[Canadian Northern Railway]]s, and has risen to become CPR's chief rival in freight carriage in Canada.<ref name="CN-History">{{cite web|url=http://www.cn.ca/companyinfo/history/en_AboutBirthofCanadianNational19161923.htm|title=Birth of Canadian National 1916–1923|work=Canadian National History|publisher=[[Canadian National Railway]]|accessdate=August 2, 2008}}</ref> Like the CPR, CN has divested itself of passenger services in favour of Via Rail Canada.<ref name="CN-Hist2">{{cite web|url=http://www.cn.ca/companyinfo/history/en_AboutProfitsandpassengers19601979.htm|title=Profits and Passengers – 1960–1979|work=Canadian National History|publisher=[[Canadian National Railway]]|accessdate=August 2, 2008}}</ref> CN's flagship train, the ''[[Super Continental]]'', ran daily from [[Central Station (Montreal)|Central Station]] to [[Vancouver]] and subsequently became a Via train in the late 1970s. It was eliminated in 1990 in favour of rerouting ''[[The Canadian]]''.

The [[commuter rail]] system is managed and operated by [[Exo (public transit)|Exo]], and reaches the outlying areas of Greater Montreal with six lines. It carried an average of 79,000 daily passengers in 2014, making it the seventh busiest in North America following New York, Chicago, Toronto, Boston, Philadelphia, and Mexico City.<ref name="EMTA">{{cite web|url=http://www.emta.com/article.php3?id_article=620|title=Montréal Public Transport System|date=February 2008|publisher=European Metropolitan Transport Authorities|accessdate=March 26, 2009}}</ref>

On 22 April 2016 the forthcoming automated [[rapid transit]] system, the [[Réseau express métropolitain]], was unveiled. Groundbreaking occurred 12 April 2018, and construction of the {{Convert|67|km|mi|adj=mid|-long}} network - consisting of three branches, 26 stations, and the conversion of the region's busiest commuter railway - commenced the following month. To be opened in three phases as of 2021, the REM will be completed by mid-2023, becoming the fourth largest automated rapid transit network after the [[Dubai Metro]], the [[Mass Rapid Transit (Singapore)|Singapore Mass Rapid Transit]], and the [[SkyTrain (Vancouver)|Vancouver SkyTrain]]. Most of it will be financed by pension fund manager [[Caisse de dépôt et placement du Québec]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/public-transit-update-for-montreals-west-island-south-shore|title=Electric light-rail train network to span Montreal by 2020|date=April 23, 2016|publisher=}}</ref>
