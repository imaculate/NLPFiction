'''Daylight saving time''' ('''DST'''), also '''daylight savings time''' or '''daylight time''' ([[United States]]), also '''summer time''' ([[United Kingdom]] and others), is the practice of advancing [[clock]]s during summer months so that evening daylight lasts longer, while sacrificing normal sunrise times. Typically, regions that use daylight saving time adjust clocks forward one hour close to the start of spring and adjust them backward in the autumn to standard time.<ref name="Downing-Prerau" /> In effect, DST causes a lost hour of sleep in the spring and an extra hour of sleep in the fall.<ref>{{cite web |title=Daylight Saving Time "fall back" doesn’t equal sleep gain |url=https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/daylight-saving-time-fall-back-doesnt-equal-sleep-gain-201311016836 |website=Harvard Health Publishing |publisher=Harvard Health Publishing |accessdate=14 October 2018}}</ref>

[[George Hudson (entomologist)|George Hudson]] proposed the idea of daylight saving in 1895.<ref name="DNZB-Hudson" /> The [[German Empire]] and [[Austria-Hungary]] organized the first nationwide implementation, starting on April 30, 1916. Many [[daylight saving time by country|countries have used it at various times]] since then, particularly since the [[1970s energy crisis|energy crisis of the 1970s]].

DST is generally not observed near the equator, where sunrise times do not vary enough to justify it. Some countries observe it only in some regions; for example, southern [[Brazil]] observes it while equatorial Brazil does not.<ref>{{cite web |title=Decretos sobre o Horário de Verão no Brasil |url=http://pcdsh01.on.br/DecHV.html |date=September 16, 2008 |language=Portuguese |publisher=Time Service Dept., National Observatory, Brazil }}</ref> Only a minority of the world's population uses DST, because Asia and Africa generally do not observe it.

DST clock shifts sometimes complicate timekeeping and can disrupt travel, billing, record keeping, medical devices, heavy equipment,<ref name=Neumann /> and sleep patterns.<ref name=Lahti /> Computer software often adjusts clocks automatically, but policy changes by various jurisdictions of DST dates and timings may be confusing.<ref name=Tong />

==Rationale==
[[Industrial society|Industrialized societies]] generally follow a clock-based schedule for daily activities that do not change throughout the course of the year. The time of day that individuals begin and end work or school, and the coordination of [[Public transport|mass transit]], for example, usually remain constant year-round. In contrast, an [[agrarian society]]'s daily routines for work and personal conduct are more likely governed by the length of daylight hours<ref name=Minnesota>{{cite news |title= Daylight savings time |url= http://www.house.leg.state.mn.us/hinfo/swkly/1995-96/select/time.txt |work= Session Weekly |publisher= Minnesota House Public Information Office |year= 1991 |accessdate= August 7, 2013 }}</ref><ref name=RoSPA>{{cite web |title= Single/Double Summer Time policy paper |date= October 2006 |publisher= Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20120913125519/http://www.rospa.com/RoadSafety/info/summertime_paper2006v2.pdf|archivedate=September 13, 2012 |url= http://www.rospa.com/roadsafety/info/summertime_paper2006v2.pdf|format= PDF }}</ref> and by [[solar time]], which change [[season]]ally because of the Earth's [[axial tilt]]. North and south of the tropics daylight lasts longer in summer and shorter in winter, with the effect becoming greater the further one moves away from the tropics.

By synchronously resetting all clocks in a region to one hour ahead of [[standard time]], individuals who follow such a year-round schedule will wake an hour earlier than they would have otherwise; they will begin and complete daily work routines an hour earlier, and they will have available to them an extra hour of daylight after their workday activities.<ref name=Hudson_1895_p734>{{cite journal |author= G.

While the times of sunrise and sunset change at roughly equal rates as the seasons change, proponents of Daylight Saving Time argue that most people prefer a greater increase in daylight hours after the typical [[Working time#Workweek structure|"nine to five"]] workday.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.snopes.com/science/daylight.asp|last= Mikkelson|first= David|title= Daylight Saving Time|website= Snopes|date= March 13, 2016|accessdate= October 17, 2016}}</ref><ref name=Willett100>{{cite web |title= 100 years of British Summer Time |url= http://www.nmm.ac.uk/explore/astronomy-and-time/time-facts/british-summer-time/ |year= 2008 |publisher= National Maritime Museum |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20141228021630/http://www.nmm.ac.uk/explore/astronomy-and-time/time-facts/british-summer-time |archivedate= December 28, 2014 |df= mdy-all }}</ref> Supporters have also argued that DST decreases [[energy consumption]] by reducing the need for lighting and heating, but the actual effect on overall energy use is [[#Dispute over benefits and drawbacks|heavily disputed]].

The manipulation of time at higher latitudes (for example [[Iceland]], [[Nunavut]] or [[Alaska]]) has little impact on daily life, because the length of day and night changes more extremely throughout the seasons (in comparison to other latitudes), and thus sunrise and sunset times are significantly out of phase with standard working hours regardless of manipulations of the clock.<ref>{{cite news|title= Bill would do away with daylight savings time in Alaska|url= http://peninsulaclarion.com/stories/031702/leg_031702ala0060001.shtml|accessdate= January 5, 2013|newspaper= Peninsula Clarion|date= March 17, 2002|quote= "Because of our high latitudinal location, the extremities in times for sunrise and sunset are more exaggerated for Alaska than anywhere else in the country," Lancaster said.

Ancient [[water clock]] that lets hour lengths vary with season]]

Although they did not fix their schedules to the clock in the modern sense, ancient civilizations adjusted daily schedules to the sun more flexibly than DST does, often dividing daylight into twelve hours regardless of daytime, so that (for example) each daylight hour became progressively longer during spring and shorter during autumn.<ref>{{cite journal |title= Daylight saving in ancient Rome |author= Berthold |journal= The Classical Journal |volume= 13 |issue= 6 |pages= 450–451 |year= 1918 }}</ref> For example, the [[Roman timekeeping|Romans kept time]] with [[water clock]]s that had different scales for different months of the year: at Rome's latitude the third hour from sunrise, [[terce|''hora tertia'']], started by modern standards at 09:02 [[solar time]] and lasted 44 minutes at the winter [[solstice]], but at the summer solstice it started at 06:58 and lasted 75 minutes.<ref>{{cite book |title =Daily Life in Ancient Rome: The People and the City at the Height of the Empire |author =Jérôme Carcopino |publisher =Yale University Press |chapter =The days and hours of the Roman calendar |isbn =0-300-00031-6 |year =1968 |authorlink =Jérôme Carcopino }}</ref> From the fourteenth century onwards, equal-length civil hours supplanted unequal ones, so [[civil time]] no longer varies by season.

In 1810, the Spanish National Assembly, [[Cortes of Cádiz]], issued a regulation that moved the sitting of certain meeting times forward by one hour from 1 May to 30 September in recognition of seasonal changes but did not actually change the clocks.

The first states to adopt DST ({{lang-de|[[:de:Sommerzeit|Sommerzeit]]}}) nationally were those of the [[German Empire]] and its [[World War I]] ally [[Austria-Hungary]] commencing April 30, 1916  as a way to conserve coal during wartime. Britain, most of its [[Allies of World War I|allies]], and many European neutrals soon followed. Russia and a few other countries waited until the next year, and the [[United States]] adopted daylight saving in 1918.

Broadly speaking, most jurisdictions abandoned daylight saving time in the years after the war ended in 1918 (with some notable exceptions including Canada, the UK, France, Ireland, and the United States). However, many different places adopted it for periods of time during the following decades and it became common during [[World War II]]. It became widely adopted, particularly in North America and Europe, starting in the 1970s as a result of the [[1970s energy crisis]].

Since then, the world has seen many enactments, adjustments, and repeals.<ref>

Clock shifts are usually scheduled at, or soon after, midnight and on a weekend to lessen disruption to weekday schedules.<ref>{{cite web |title=Information for visitors |url=http://www.lordhoweisland.info/important-info.htm |publisher=Lord Howe Island Tourism Association |accessdate=April 20, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090503074945/http://www.lordhoweisland.info/important-info.htm |archivedate=May 3, 2009 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> A one-hour shift is customary but twenty minute and two hour shifts have been used in the past. In all countries that use daylight saving, the clock is advanced in spring and set back in autumn; the spring change reduces the length of that day and the autumn change increases it. For a midnight shift in spring, a digital display of local time would appear to jump from 11:59:59.9 to 01:00:00.0.

The time at which clocks are to be shifted differs across jurisdictions. The [[European Union]] has a coordinated shift, shifting all zones at the same instant, at 01:00 [[Coordinated Universal Time]] (UTC), which means that it changes at 02:00 [[Central European Time]] (CET) or 03:00 [[Eastern European Time]] (EET), the result is that the time differences across European time zone remain constant.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.npl.co.uk/reference/faqs/at-what-time-should-clocks-go-forward-or-back-for-summer-time-faq-time|last=National Physical Laboratory|title=At what time should clocks go forward or back for summer time (FAQ – Time)|date=March 31, 2016|accessdate=October 17, 2016|quote=The time at which summer time begins and ends is given in the relevant EU Directive and UK Statutory Instrument as 1&nbsp;am. Greenwich Mean Time (GMT) ... All time signals are based on Coordinated Universal Time (UTC), which can be almost one second ahead of, or behind, GMT so there is a brief period in the UK when the directive is not being strictly followed.}}</ref><ref name=Myers /> North America shifts at 02:00 but at the local time and is consequently uncoordinated so that, for example, [[Mountain Time Zone|Mountain Time]] is, for one hour, zero hours ahead of Pacific Time instead of one hour ahead in the autumn and two hours instead of one ahead of [[Pacific Time Zone|Pacific Time]] in the spring.

The dates on which clocks are to be shifted also vary with location and year; consequently, the time differences between regions also vary throughout the year. For example, Central European Time is usually six hours ahead [[Eastern Time Zone|North American Eastern Time]], except for a few weeks in March and October/November, while the United Kingdom and mainland Chile could be five hours apart during the northern summer, three hours during the southern summer, and four hours a few weeks per year. Since 1996, [[European Summer Time]] has been observed from the last Sunday in March to the last Sunday in October; previously the rules were not uniform across the European Union.<ref name=Myers /> Starting in 2007, most of the United States and Canada observe DST from the second Sunday in March to the first Sunday in November, almost two-thirds of the year.<ref>{{cite news |author=Tom Baldwin |date=March 12, 2007 |url=https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/us-gets-summertime-blues-as-the-clocks-go-forward-3-weeks-early-d5rjglj28bx |title=US gets summertime blues as the clocks go forward 3 weeks early |work=The Times |location=London }}</ref> Moreover, the beginning and ending dates are roughly reversed between the northern and southern hemispheres because spring and autumn are displaced six months. For example, mainland [[Time in Chile|Chile]] observes DST from the second Saturday in October to the second Saturday in March, with transitions at [[24-hour clock#Midnight 00:00 and 24:00|24:00]] local time.<ref>{{cite web |title=Historia de la hora oficial de Chile |date=October 1, 2008 |publisher=Chilean Hydrographic and Oceanographic Service |language=Spanish |url=http://www.horaoficial.cl/historia_hora.html}}</ref> In some countries time is governed by regional jurisdictions within the country so that some jurisdictions shift and others do not; this is currently the case in Australia, Brazil, Canada, Mexico, and the United States.<ref>{{cite book |title=[[#Seize|Seize the Daylight]] |pages=179–180 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation-now/2017/03/09/arizona-no-daylight-saving-time/98964644/|title=Why Arizona doesn't observe daylight-saving time|work=usatoday.com}}</ref>

From year to year, the shift dates may change for political and social reasons. The 2007 U.S. change was part of the [[Energy Policy Act of 2005]]; previously, from 1987 through 2006, the start and end dates were the first Sunday in April and the last Sunday in October, and [[United States Congress|Congress]] retains the right to go back to the previous dates now that an energy-consumption study has been done.<ref>{{cite web |title=Energy Policy Act of 2005, Public Law 109-58 §&nbsp;110 |url=http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/getdoc.cgi?dbname=109_cong_public_laws&docid=f:publ058.109 |date=August 8, 2005 }}</ref> Proponents for permanently retaining November as the month for ending DST point to [[Halloween]] as a reason to delay the change—to provide extra daylight on October 31. In the past, [[Australia Central Daylight Time|Australian]] state jurisdictions not only changed at different local times but sometimes on different dates; for example, in 2008 most DST-observing states shifted clocks forward on October 5 but [[Western Australia]] shifted on October 26.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bom.gov.au/climate/averages/tables/dst_times.shtml |title=Implementation dates of daylight saving time within Australia |publisher=Bureau of Meteorology |date=September 22, 2009 }}</ref>

After many hearings the proposal was narrowly defeated in a [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|parliamentary]] committee vote in 1909.

After Germany led the way with starting DST ({{lang-de|[[:de:Sommerzeit|Sommerzeit]]}}) during [[World War I]] on April 30, 1916 together with its allies to alleviate hardships from wartime coal shortages and air raid blackouts, the political equation changed in other countries; the United Kingdom used DST first on May 21, 1916.<ref name="Prerau-51-70">{{cite book |title=[[#Seize|Seize the Daylight]] |pages=51–70 }}</ref> U.S. retailing and manufacturing interests led by [[Pittsburgh]] industrialist Robert Garland soon began lobbying for DST, but were opposed by railroads.

The war's end swung the pendulum back. Farmers continued to dislike DST, and many countries repealed it after the war. Britain was an exception: it retained DST nationwide but over the years adjusted transition dates for several reasons, including special rules during the 1920s and 1930s to avoid clock shifts on Easter mornings. Now under a European Community directive summer time begins annually on the last Sunday in March, which may be Easter Sunday (as in 2016).<ref name=Myers>{{cite web |author=Joseph Myers |title=History of legal time in Britain |url=http://jsm28.user.srcf.net/british-time/ |date=July 17, 2009 }}</ref> The U.S. was more typical: Congress repealed DST after 1919.

Proponents of DST generally argue that it saves energy, promotes outdoor leisure activity in the evening (in summer), and is therefore good for physical and psychological health, reduces traffic accidents, reduces crime or is good for business. Groups that tend to support DST are urban workers, retail businesses, outdoor sports enthusiasts and businesses, tourism operators, and others who benefit from having more hours of light after the end of a typical workday in the warmer months.

Some areas may adopt DST simply as a matter of coordination with others rather than for any direct benefits.

The savings in electricity may also be offset by extra use of other types of energy, such as heating fuel.

The period of Daylight Saving Time before the longest day is shorter than the period after, in several countries including the United States and Europe. For example, in the U.S. the period of Daylight Saving Time is defined by the Energy Policy Act of 2005. The period for Daylight Saving Time was extended by changing the start date from the first Sunday of April to the second Sunday of March, and the end date from the last Sunday in October to the first Sunday in November.

DST's potential to save energy comes primarily from its effects on residential lighting, which consumes about 3.5% of electricity in the United States and Canada.<ref name="Aries" /> (For comparison, air conditioning uses 16.5% of energy in the United States.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.wired.com/2013/10/an-ingenious-wristband-that-keeps-your-body-at-the-perfect-temperature-no-ac-required/|title=MIT Wristband Could Make AC Obsolete|last=Vanhemert|first=Kyle|date=30 October 2013|work=Wired|access-date=2018-06-13|language=en-US}}</ref>)  Delaying the nominal time of sunset and sunrise reduces the use of artificial light in the evening and increases it in the morning. As Franklin's 1784 satire pointed out, lighting costs are reduced if the evening reduction outweighs the morning increase, as in high-latitude summer when most people wake up well after sunrise. An early goal of DST was to reduce evening usage of [[incandescent lighting]], once a primary use of electricity.<ref name="Bartlett">{{cite book |author=Roscoe G.

Those who benefit most from DST are the retailers, sporting goods makers, and other businesses that benefit from extra afternoon sunlight.<ref name=":0" />  Having more hours of sunlight in between the end of the typical workday and bedtime induces customers to shop and to participate in outdoor afternoon sports.<ref>{{cite news |title=Daylight-saving time becomes daylight-spending time for many businesses |author=Dana Knight |work=Indianapolis Star |date=April 17, 2006 }}</ref>  People are more likely to stop by a store on their way home from work if the sun is still up.<ref name=":0" />  In 1984, ''[[Fortune (magazine)|Fortune]]'' magazine estimated that a seven-week extension of DST would yield an additional $30&nbsp;million for [[7-Eleven]] stores, and the [[National Golf Foundation]] estimated the extension would increase golf industry revenues $200&nbsp;million to $300&nbsp;million.<ref>{{cite book |title=[[#Spring-Forward|Spring forward]] |pages=147–148 }}</ref> A 1999 study estimated that DST increases the revenue of the [[European Union]]'s leisure sector by about 3%.<ref name=Aries />

=={{anchor|Mnemonic}}Terminology==
As explained by Richard Meade in the English Journal of the (American) National Council of Teachers of English, the form ''daylight savings time'' (with an "s") was already in 1978 much more common than the older form ''daylight saving time'' in American English ("the change has been virtually accomplished"). Nevertheless, even dictionaries such as Merriam-Webster's, American Heritage, and Oxford, which describe actual usage instead of prescribing outdated usage (and therefore also list the newer form), still list the older form first. This is because the older form is still very common in print and preferred by many editors. ("Although ''daylight saving time'' is considered correct, ''daylight savings time'' (with an "s") is commonly used.")<ref>{{cite book |title=[[#Seize|Seize the Daylight]] |page=xv }}</ref> The first two words are sometimes hyphenated (''daylight-saving(s) time''). Merriam-Webster's also lists the forms '''daylight saving''' (without "time"), '''daylight savings''' (without "time"), and '''daylight time'''.<ref name=variants>''Daylight saving time'' and its variants:

[...] The rise of ''daylight savings time'' appears to have resulted from the avoidance of a miscue: when ''saving'' is used, readers might puzzle momentarily over whether ''saving'' is a gerund (the saving of daylight) or a participle (the time for saving). [...] Using ''savings'' as the adjective—as in ''savings account'' or ''savings bond''—makes perfect sense.  More than that, it ought to be accepted as the better form."<ref>[https://books.google.fi/books?id=z_VmtjAU01YC&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q="daylight%20savings%20time" Oxford Dictionary of American Usage and Style], p. 95</ref>

In Britain, Willett's 1907 proposal<ref name=Willett /> used the term ''daylight saving'', but by 1911 the term ''summer time'' replaced ''daylight saving time'' in draft legislation.<ref name="Prerau-22" /> The same or similar expressions are used in many other languages: ''Sommerzeit'' in German, ''zomertijd'' in Dutch, ''kesäaika'' in Finnish, ''horario de verano'' or ''hora de verano'' in Spanish, and ''[[w:fr:heure d'été|heure d'été]]'' in French.<ref name="Prerau-51-70" />

The name of local time typically changes when DST is observed. American English replaces ''standard'' with ''daylight'': for example, ''[[Pacific Time Zone|Pacific Standard Time]]'' (''PST'') becomes ''Pacific Daylight Time'' (''PDT''). In the United Kingdom, the standard term for UK time when advanced by one hour is ''[[British Summer Time]]'' (BST), and British English typically inserts ''summer'' into other time zone names, e.g. ''[[Central European Time]]'' (''CET'') becomes ''[[Central European Summer Time]]'' (''CEST'').

The North American English mnemonic "spring forward, fall back" (also "spring ahead&nbsp;...", "spring up&nbsp;...", and "...&nbsp;fall behind") helps people remember in which direction to shift the clocks.<ref name="Downing-Prerau" />

Changes to DST rules cause problems in existing computer installations. For example, the [[Energy Policy Act of 2005#Change to daylight saving time|2007 change to DST rules]] in North America required that many computer systems be upgraded, with the greatest impact on e-mail and calendar programs. The upgrades required a significant effort by corporate [[Information technology|information technologists]].<ref>{{cite news |author=Steve Lohr |title=Time change a 'mini-Y2K' in tech terms |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/03/05/technology/05daylight.html |work=New York Times |date=March 5, 2007 }}</ref>

Some applications standardize on UTC to avoid problems with clock shifts and time zone differences.<ref>{{cite conference |author1=A. Gut |author2=L. Miclea |author3=Sz. Enyedi |author4=M. Abrudean |author5=I. Hoka |title=Database globalization in enterprise applications |booktitle=2006 IEEE International Conference on Automation, Quality and Testing, Robotics |year=2006 |pages=356–359 }}</ref>
Likewise, most modern operating systems internally handle and store all times as UTC and only convert to local time for display.<ref>{{cite web |author=Ron Bean |url=http://tldp.org/HOWTO/Clock-2.html |title=The Clock Mini-HOWTO |date=November 2000}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |author=Raymond Chen |url=http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2004/09/02/224672.aspx |title=Why does Windows keep your BIOS clock on local time? |date=November 2000}}</ref>

However, even if UTC is used internally, the systems still require external [[leap second]] updates and time zone information to correctly calculate local time as needed. Many systems in use today base their date/time calculations from data derived from the [[tz&nbsp;database]] also known as '''zoneinfo'''.

===IANA time zone database===
The [[tz&nbsp;database]] maps a name to the named location's historical and predicted clock shifts. This database is used by many computer software systems, including most [[Unix-like]] operating systems, [[Java (Sun)|Java]], and the [[Oracle RDBMS]];<ref>{{cite web |author1=Paul Eggert |author2=Arthur David Olson |url=http://www.twinsun.com/tz/tz-link.htm |title=Sources for time zone and daylight saving time data |date=June 30, 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120623013511/http://www.twinsun.com/tz/tz-link.htm |archivedate=June 23, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> [[Hewlett-Packard|HP]]'s "tztab" database is similar but incompatible.<ref>{{cite book |publisher=Hewlett–Packard Co |title=HP-UX Reference: HP-UX 11i Version 3 |chapterurl=http://h20000.www2.hp.com/bc/docs/support/SupportManual/c02271674/c02271674.pdf |chapter=tztab(4) |year=2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130921054222/http://h20000.www2.hp.com/bc/docs/support/SupportManual/c02271674/c02271674.pdf |archivedate=September 21, 2013 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> When temporal authorities change DST rules, zoneinfo updates are installed as part of ordinary system maintenance. In Unix-like systems the TZ [[environment variable]] specifies the [[List of tz zones by name|location name]], as in <code>TZ=':America/New_York'</code>. In many of those systems there is also a system-wide setting that is applied if the TZ environment variable is not set: this setting is controlled by the contents of the {{kbd|/etc/localtime}} file, which is usually a [[symbolic link]] or [[hard link]] to one of the zoneinfo files. Internal time is stored in timezone-independent [[epoch time]]; the TZ is used by each of potentially many simultaneous users and processes to independently localize time display.

Older or stripped-down systems may support only the TZ values required by [[POSIX]], which specify at most one start and end rule explicitly in the value. For example, <code>TZ='EST5EDT,M3.2.0/02:00,M11.1.0/02:00'</code> specifies time for the eastern United States starting in 2007. Such a TZ value must be changed whenever DST rules change, and the new value applies to all years, mishandling some older timestamps.<ref>{{cite book |url=http://www.unix.org/version3/ |publisher=The Open Group |title=IEEE Std 1003.1–2004 |year=2004 |chapterurl=http://www.opengroup.org/susv3/basedefs/xbd_chap08.html#tag_08_03 |chapter=Other environment variables }}</ref>

===Microsoft Windows===
As with zoneinfo, a user of [[Microsoft Windows]] configures DST by specifying the name of a location, and the operating system then consults a table of rule sets that must be updated when DST rules change. Procedures for specifying the name and updating the table vary with release. Updates are not issued for older versions of Microsoft Windows.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://support.microsoft.com/gp/cp_dst |title=Daylight saving time help and support center |publisher=Microsoft Corp |date=September 14, 2007 }}</ref> [[Windows Vista]] supports at most two start and end rules per time zone setting. In a Canadian location observing DST, a single Vista setting supports both 1987–2006 and post-2006 time stamps, but mishandles some older time stamps. Older Microsoft Windows systems usually store only a single start and end rule for each zone, so that the same Canadian setting reliably supports only post-2006 time stamps.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/vstudio/bb264729.aspx |title=Visual Studio and daylight saving time change |publisher=Microsoft Corp |year=2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120831234055/http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/vstudio/bb264729.aspx |archivedate=August 31, 2012 }}</ref>

These limitations have caused problems. For example, before 2005, DST in [[Israel]] varied each year and was skipped some years. [[Windows 95]] used rules correct for 1995 only, causing problems in later years. In [[Windows 98]], Microsoft marked Israel as not having DST, forcing Israeli users to shift their computer clocks manually twice a year. The 2005 [[Israeli Daylight Saving Law]] established predictable rules using the Jewish calendar but Windows zone files could not represent the rules' dates in a year-independent way. Partial workarounds, which mishandled older time stamps, included manually switching zone files every year<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.lingnu.com/en/support.html#timezone |title=Windows daylight savings timezones for Israel |publisher=Lingnu Open Source Consulting |year=2009 }}</ref> and a Microsoft tool that switches zones automatically.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.microsoft.com/israel/support/tips/other/DLSTIssues.mspx |title=Microsoft support entry regarding daylight saving time in Israel |publisher=Microsoft Corp |language=Hebrew |year=2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131103195513/http://www.microsoft.com/israel/support/tips/other/DLSTIssues.mspx |archivedate=November 3, 2013 }}</ref> In 2013, Israel standardized its daylight saving time according to the [[Gregorian calendar]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.jpost.com/Diplomacy-and-Politics/Knesset-votes-to-extend-Daylight-Saving-Time-319157|last=Harkov |first=Lahav |title=Knesset votes to extend Daylight Saving Time |newspaper=Jerusalem Post |date=July 8, 2013 |location=Jerusalem |accessdate=October 20, 2016}}</ref>

Microsoft Windows keeps the system [[real-time clock]] in local time. This causes several problems, including compatibility when [[multi boot]]ing with operating systems that set the clock to UTC, and double-adjusting the clock when multi booting different Windows versions, such as with a rescue boot disk. This approach is a problem even in Windows-only systems: there is no support for per-user timezone settings, only a single system-wide setting. In 2008 Microsoft hinted that future versions of Windows will partially support a [[Windows registry]] entry <var>RealTimeIsUniversal</var> that had been introduced many years earlier, when [[Windows NT]] supported [[RISC]] machines with UTC clocks, but had not been maintained.<ref name=RealTimeIsUniversal>{{cite web |url=http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~mgk25/mswish/ut-rtc.html |title=IBM PC Real Time Clock should run in UT |publisher=Computer Laboratory, University of Cambridge |author=Markus Kuhn |date=February 10, 2009 }}</ref> Since then at least two fixes related to this feature have been published by Microsoft.<ref name=KB2922223>{{cite web |url=http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2922223 |title=You cannot change system time if RealTimeIsUniversal registry entry is enabled in Windows |author=Microsoft }}</ref><ref name=KB2800213>{{cite web |url=http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2800213 |title=High CPU usage during DST changeover in Windows Server 2008, Windows 7, or Windows Server 2008 R2 |author=Microsoft }}</ref>

The [[NTFS]] file system used by recent versions of Windows stores the file with a UTC time stamp, but displays it corrected to local—or seasonal—time. However, the [[File Allocation Table|FAT]] filesystem commonly used on removable devices stores only the local time. Consequently, when a file is copied from the hard disk onto separate media, its time will be set to the current local time. If the time adjustment is changed, the timestamps of the original file and the copy will be different. The same effect can be observed when compressing and uncompressing files with some [[file archiver]]s. It is the NTFS file that changes seen time. This effect should be kept in mind when trying to determine if a file is a duplicate of another, although there are other methods of comparing files for equality (such as using a [[checksum algorithm]]).  A ready clue is if the time stamps differ by precisely 1 hour.

==Permanent daylight saving time==
{{see also|Decree time}}
A move to "permanent daylight saving time" (staying on summer hours all year with no time shifts) is sometimes advocated and is currently implemented in some jurisdictions such as Argentina, Belarus,<ref name=Guardian>{{cite news|last=Parfitt|first=Tom|title=Think of the cows: clocks go forward for the last time in Russia|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/mar/25/clocks-go-forward-last-time-russia?|accessdate=January 5, 2012|newspaper=The Guardian|date=March 25, 2011}}</ref> Canada (e.g. [[Time in Saskatchewan|Saskatchewan]]), Iceland, Turkey, Morocco,<ref>{{cite press release |last= |first= |date= |title=Release of the Moroccan Official Journal |trans-title= |url=http://www.sgg.gov.ma/Portals/1/BO/2018/BO_6720-bis_Ar.pdf?ver=2018-10-27-101217-477 |language=Arabic |location= |publisher= |agency= |access-date=2018-10-31}}</ref> Namibia, and São Tomé and Príncipe. It could be a result of following the timezone of a neighbouring region, political will, or other causes. Advocates cite the same advantages as normal DST without the problems associated with the twice yearly time shifts. However, many remain unconvinced of the benefits, citing the same problems and the relatively late sunrises, particularly in winter, that year-round DST entails.<ref name="Handwerk"/>

Russia switched to permanent DST from 2011 to 2014, but the move proved unpopular because of the late sunrises in winter, so the country switched permanently back to standard time in 2014 for the whole Russian Federation.<ref>{{cite news|title=Russia set to turn back the clocks with daylight-saving time shift|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jul/01/russia-state-duma-daylight-saving-time-summer|accessdate=October 25, 2014|work=The Guardian|date=July 1, 2014}}</ref> The United Kingdom and Ireland also experimented with year-round summer time between 1968 and 1971, and put clocks forward by an extra hour during [[World War II]].<ref>{{cite news|last1=Hollingshead|first1=Iain|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2006/jun/24/comment.mainsection2|work=The Guardian|date=June 2006|title=Whatever happened to Double Summer Time?}}</ref>

In the United States, the Florida legislature passed a bill to enact permanent DST; and Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, and Rhode Island have introduced proposals or commissions to that effect.<ref>{{cite news|title=Year-Round Daylight Saving Time? |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/08/us/daylight-saving-time-florida.html |date=2018-03-08 |accessdate=2018-11-02}}</ref> Although 26 states have considered making DST permanent, unless Congress changes federal law, states can not implement permanent DST—states can only opt out of DST, not standard time.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2018/11/01/daylight-saving-time-ends-sunday-get-ready-fall-back/1846836002/|title=Fall back!
