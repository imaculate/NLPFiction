A '''militia''' {{IPAc-en|m|ᵻ|ˈ|l|ɪ|ʃ|ə}}<ref>{{cite web |work=[[Oxford English Dictionary]] |date=June 2009 |title=militia, ''n''}}</ref> is generally an [[army]] or some other [[Military formation|fighting organization]] of non-professional soldiers, citizens of a nation, or subjects of a state, who can be called upon for military service during a time of need, as opposed to a professional force of [[Regular army|regular]], full-time [[military personnel]], or historically, members of a warrior nobility class (e.g., [[knight]]s or [[samurai]]). Generally unable to hold ground against regular forces, it is common for militias to be used for aiding regular troops by [[skirmisher|skirmishing]], holding fortifications, or [[irregular warfare]], instead of being used in offensive campaigns by themselves. Militia are often limited by local civilian laws to serve only in their home region, and to serve only for a limited time; this further reduces their use in long military campaigns.

With the emergence of professional forces (in the form of mercenaries whose livelihood was military service) during the [[Renaissance]], Western European militias wilted; later however, they would be revived as part of Florentine [[Classical republicanism|civic humanism]], which held that professional militaries were a result of corruption, and admired the Roman model.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www2.idehist.uu.se/distans/ilmh/Ren/civic-mil.htm|title=The Militia|last=Hörnqvist|first=Michael|website=Civic Humanism – The Florentine Legacy|publisher=Uppsala University|access-date=21 July 2016}}</ref> The civic humanist ideal of the militia was spread through Europe by the writings of [[Niccolò Machiavelli]] (According to Hörnqvist, [[The Prince]], ch. 12 and 13, [[Discourses on Livy]], and [[The Art of War (Machiavelli)|The Art of War]].)

Beginning in the late 20th century, some militias (in particular officially recognized and sanctioned militias of a government) act as professional forces, while still being "part-time" or "on-call" organizations. For instance, the members of some [[U.S. Army National Guard]] units are considered professional soldiers, as they are trained to maintain the same standards as their "full-time" (active duty) counterparts.{{Citation needed|date=November 2016}}

Militias thus can be [[military]] or [[paramilitary]], depending on the instance. Some of the contexts in which the term "militia" is used include:
* Forces engaged in defense activity or service, to protect a community, its territory, property, and laws.<ref>p.7, Sumner</ref>
* The entire able-bodied population of a community, town, county, or [[State (polity)|state]], available to be called to arms.
** A subset of these who may be legally penalized for failing to respond to a call-up.
** A subset of these who actually respond to a call-up, regardless of legal obligation.
* A private, non-government force, not necessarily directly supported or sanctioned by its [[government]].
* An irregular armed force enabling its leader to exercise military, economic, and political control over a subnational territory within a sovereign state (See: [[Warlord]]).
* An official reserve army, composed of citizen [[soldier]]s. Called by various names in different countries, such as the [[Army Reserve (disambiguation)|Army Reserve]], [[National Guard (disambiguation)|National Guard]], or [[state defense force]]s.
* The national [[police]] forces in several former [[communist states]] such as the [[Soviet Union]] and the [[Warsaw Pact]] countries, but also in the [[Non-Aligned Movement|non-aligned]] [[SFR Yugoslavia]]. The term was inherited in [[Russia]] and other former [[Commonwealth of Independent States|CIS]] countries, where they are known as ''[[militsiya]]''.
* In [[France]] the equivalent term "[[Milice]]" has become tainted due to its use by notorious [[collaborationism|collaborator]]s with [[Nazi Germany]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}}

==Etymology==
''Militia'' derives from [[Latin language|Latin]] roots:
* ''miles'' /miːles/ : soldier<ref name="Charlton T. Lewis 1997">Charlton T. Lewis, An Elementary Latin Dictionary, p. 505, Oxford U. Pr., 1997.</ref>
* ''-itia'' /iːtia/ : a state, activity, quality or condition of being<ref>[http://www.class.uidaho.edu/luschnig/Latin%20Vocab/4.htm]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120306002835/http://www.class.uidaho.edu/luschnig/Latin%20Vocab/4.htm |date=March 6, 2012 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://academic.brooklyn.cuny.edu/classics/jvsickle/wrlith.htm |title=Roots of Style: Radicals of Latin (& Greek) in English (JVS) |publisher=Academic.brooklyn.cuny.edu |date= |accessdate=2014-02-22 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130327055950/http://academic.brooklyn.cuny.edu/classics/jvsickle/wrlith.htm |archive-date=2013-03-27 |dead-url=yes |df= }}</ref>
* ''militia'' /mil:iːtia/: Military service<ref name="Charlton T. Lewis 1997"/>

The word ''militia'' dates back to ancient Rome, and more recently to at least 1590 when it was recorded in a book by Sir John Smythe, ''Certain Discourses Military'' with the meanings: a military force; a body of soldiers and military affairs; a body of military discipline<ref>Oxford English Dictionary, March 2002. Oxford University Press.</ref>
The word Militia comes from ancient Latin, in which it meant defense service, as distinguished from a body of (armed) defenders which would be ''volgus militum''. It should be noted that the term is used by several countries with the meaning of "defense activity" indicating it is taken directly from Latin.

==Argentina==
In the early 1800s [[Buenos Aires]], which was by then the capital of the [[Viceroyalty of the Río de la Plata]], was attacked during the [[British invasions of the Río de la Plata]]. As regular military forces were insufficient to counter the British attackers, [[Santiago de Liniers]] drafted all males in the city capable of bearing arms into the military. These recruits included the [[criollo peoples]], who ranked low down in the social hierarchy, as well as some slaves. With these reinforcements, the British armies were twice defeated.<ref>[http://www.granaderovoluntario.com.ar]   {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130513224611/http://www.granaderovoluntario.com.ar/ |date=May 13, 2013 }}</ref> The militias became a strong factor in the politics of the city afterwards, as a springboard from which the ''criollos'' could manifest their political ambitions.<ref>Lyman Johnson, ''Workshop of Revolution: Plebeian Buenos Aires and the Atlantic World, 1776–1810'', Duke University Press, United States p. 264</ref> They were a key element in the success of the [[May Revolution]], which deposed the Spanish viceroy and began the [[Argentine War of Independence]]. A decree by [[Mariano Moreno]] derogated the system of promotions involving ''criollos'',{{clarify|post-text=meaning unclear|date=May 2014}} allowing instead their promotion on military merit.

The [[Argentine Civil War]] was waged by militias again, as both federalists and unitarians drafted common people into their ranks as part of ongoing conflicts. These irregular armies were organized at a provincial level, and assembled as leagues depending on political pacts.<ref>Academia Nacional de la Historia Journal, ''Partes de batalla de las guerras civiles'', 1977 {{es icon}}</ref> This system had declined by the 1870s, mainly due to the establishment of the modern [[Argentine Army]], drafted for the [[Paraguayan War]] by President [[Bartolome Mitre]].<ref>Miguel Angel De Marco, ''La guerra del Paraguay'', Ed.

==Armenia==
[[File:Armenian Fedayees 1890-1896.jpg|thumb|[[Armenian fedayi|Armenian ''fedayi'']] were [[Armenia]]n [[irregular military|irregular militia]] formed in the late 19th and early 20th century to defend Armenian villages.]]
{{Main|Armenian irregular units}}
Armenian militia, or ''[[Armenian fedayi|fedayi]]'' played a major role in the independence of various Armenian states, including [[Western Armenia]], the [[First Republic of Armenia]], and the currently de facto independent [[Republic of Artsakh]]. Armenian militia also played a role in the [[War in Abkhazia (1992–1993)|Georgia-Abkhazia War]] of 1992–1993.

==Australia==
In the [[Colony of New South Wales]] Governor [[Lachlan Macquarie]] proposed a [[Militia (British Dominions and Crown Colonies)|colonial militia]] but the idea was rejected. Governor [[Ralph Darling]] felt a [[mounted police]] force was more efficient than a militia. A [[military volunteer]] movement attracted wide interest during the [[Crimean War]].<ref>pp. 21–22 Grey, Jeffrey ''A Military History of Australia'' Cambridge University Press</ref> Following Federation, the various military reserve forces of the [[Commonwealth of Australia]] became the [[Citizen Military Force]] (CMF).

A citizens' militia modeled on the [[British Home Guard]] called the [[Volunteer Defence Corps (Australia)|Volunteer Defence Corps]] (VDC) was founded by the [[Returned and Services League of Australia]] (RSL) in 1940 in response to the possibility of a Japanese invasion of Australia. In the beginning, members didn't have uniforms and often paraded in business attire. They were given instruction on [[guerrilla warfare]], and later the private organization was taken over by the Australian Government and became part of the [[Australian Military Forces]] (AMF). The government supported the organization and equipped them with [[anti-aircraft artillery]]; however, they were disbanded by the end of World War II due to the fact that there was no longer a significant threat to national security.

==Austria==
{{Unreferenced section|date=July 2008}}
[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 102-00839, Österreich, Republikanischer Schutzbund.jpg|thumb|[[Republikanischer Schutzbund]] was an [[Austria]]n militia formed in 1923, one of several militias formed in post-[[World War I]] Austria.]]

During the [[Revolutions of 1848 in the Austrian Empire]], a National Guard was established in Vienna. A separate but related [[Academic Legion (Vienna)|Academic Legion]] was composed mainly of students in the capital city.

After [[World War I]], multiple militias formed as [[soldier]]s returned home to their [[village]]s, only to find many of them occupied by [[State of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs|Slovene]] and [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia|Yugoslav]] forces. Especially in the southern province of [[Carinthia (province)|Carinthia]] the Volkswehr (Peoples Defense Force) was formed, to fight the occupant forces.

During the [[First Austrian Republic|First Republic]], similar to the development in [[Germany]], increasing [[radicalization]] of politics led to certain [[paramilitary]] militias associating with certain [[political parties]]. The [[Heimwehr]] (German: ''Home Defense'') became affiliated with the [[Christian Social Party (Austria)|Christian Social Party]] and the [[Republikanischer Schutzbund]] (German: ''Republican Defense League'') became affiliated with the [[Social Democratic Party of Austria|Social Democratic Workers' Party of Austria]]. Violence increasingly escalated, breaking out during the [[July Revolt of 1927]] and finally the [[Austrian Civil War]], when the Schutzbund was defeated by the Heimwehr, [[Law enforcement in Austria|police]], [[Gendarmerie (Austria)|Gendarmerie]] and [[Austrian Armed Forces]].

After [[World War II]] the [[Austrian Armed Forces]] (Bundesheer) were reestablished as a [[conscript]] military force. A basic part of it is the militia, which is a regular reservists force of the Bundesheer, comparable to the [[National Guard of the United States|national guard]] units of the United States. The conscript soldiers of the militia have to store their military equipment at home, to be mobilized quite fast within a few days in case of emergency. The system was established during the [[Cold War]] and still exists, but the members of the militia now are volunteers only.

In Canada the title "Militia" historically referred to the land component of the armed forces, both regular (full-time) and reserve. The earliest [[Canadian militia]]s date from the beginning of the French colonial period. In [[New France]], King Louis XIV created a compulsory militia of settlers in every parish that supported French authorities in the defence and expansion of the colony.

Following the British [[Conquest of 1760|conquest of New France]] in 1760, local militia units supported [[British Army]] regiments stationed in [[British North America]]. In addition to the Canadian militia, British regiments were also supported by locally raised regulars (including the [[40th (the 2nd Somersetshire) Regiment of Foot|40th Regiment of Foot]], and the [[100th (Prince of Wales's Royal Canadian) Regiment of Foot]]) and [[Fencibles]] regiments. These regiments were raised through ordinary modes of recruiting, as opposed to being raised by ballot like the militia. Most militia units were only activated in time of war, but remained inactive in between. The battle honours awarded to these colonial militia regiments are perpetuated by modern regiments within the [[Canadian Army]].

Defence of [[the Canadas]] long relied on a contingent of British soldiers, as well as support from the [[Royal Navy]]. However, the Crimean War saw the diversion of a significant amount of British soldiers from [[British North America]]. Fearing possible incursions from the United States, the [[Legislative Assembly of the Province of Canada]] passed the [[Militia Act of 1855]], creating the Active Militia.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://cmhg-phmc.forces.gc.ca/cmh-pmc/page-448-eng.aspx |title=The 1855 Volunteers |publisher=Government of Canada |work=Canadian Military Heritage, vol. 2 |date=1 May 2017 |accessdate=15 December 2017 }}</ref> The Active Militia, later referred to as the [[Permanent Active Militia]] (PAM), was created as a full-time professional army, although it continued to use the label militia. After PAM's formation, the remaining sedentary militia regiments were collectively referred to as the [[Non-Permanent Active Militia]] (NPAM).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://cmhg-phmc.forces.gc.ca/cmh-pmc/page-545-eng.aspx|title=The Defence of Canada by Canadians

Prior to [[Canadian Confederation]], the colonies that made up the [[The Maritimes|Maritimes]], and [[Newfoundland Colony|Newfoundland]] maintained their own militias independent of the Canadian Militia.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://cmhg-phmc.forces.gc.ca/cmh-pmc/page-449-eng.aspx|title=In the Maritimes|work=Canadian Military Heritage, vol. 2|date=1 May 2017|accessdate=16 January 2018|publisher=Government of Canada}}</ref> From 1853 to 1871, the [[Colony of Vancouver Island]] (and the succeeding [[Colony of British Columbia (1866–1871)|Colony of British Columbia]]) periodically raised and disbanded militia units. These units were raised for specific purposes, or in response to a specific threat, real or perceived.<ref>{{cite journal|publisher=Canadian Forces|last=Goulet|first=Adam|title=The Colonial Militia of Vancouver Island and British Columbia 1853–1871|journal=Canadian Military Journal|volume=14|issue=3|page=64|year=2014}}</ref>
[[File:The Canadian Militia, 1898.jpg|thumb|left|Uniforms of the [[Canadian Militia]] in 1898. The force included the [[Permanent Active Militia]], a full-time professional land force which became the [[Canadian Army]] in 1940.]]
After the [[Treaty of Washington (1871)|Treaty of Washington]] was signed between the Americans and British, nearly all remaining British soldiers were withdrawn from Canada in November 1871.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://cmhg-phmc.forces.gc.ca/cmh-pmc/page-507-eng.aspx|title=Withdrawal of British Troops from Canada|work=Canadian Military Heritage, vol. 3|publisher=Government of Canada|accessdate=14 December 2017|date=1 May 2017}}</ref> The departure of the majority of British forces in Canada made the Canadian militia the only major land forces available in Canada. In 1940, both components of the militia, PAM and NPAM were reorganized, and renamed the Canadian Army. NPAM was integrated into the Canadian Army as the Army's [[Primary Reserve]].

The term Militia is still used from then to the present day to refer to the part-time army reserve component of the [[Canadian Forces]]. Currently, Militia troops usually train one night a week and every other weekend of the month, except in the summer. Summertime training may consist of courses, individual call-outs, or concentrations (unit and formation training of one to two weeks' duration). In addition, [[Primary Reserve]] members are increasingly used for voluntary service as augmentation to the regular force overseas—usually [[NATO]] or [[United Nations]] missions. Most Canadian cities and counties have one or more militia units.

In addition to the various colonial militia units, and the regiments of the Canadian militia, in 1942, the Army's [[Pacific Command (Canadian Army)|Pacific Command]] created the Pacific Coast Militia Rangers. Intended to function similarly to the [[United Kingdom]]'s [[Home Guard (United Kingdom)|Home Guard]], the Rangers were a secondary defence force, defending the coast of [[British Columbia]] and [[Yukon]] from potential Japanese attack.<ref>{{cite book|title=The Canadian Rangers: A Living History|pages=32–33|last=Lackenbauer|first=P. Whitney|publisher=UBC Press|year=2013|isbn=0-7748-2455-7}}</ref> The Rangers were disbanded in September 1945, shortly after the conclusion of World War II. The legacy of the Pacific Coast Militia Rangers is perpetuated by the [[Canadian Rangers]], a component of the Primary Reserve that provides a military presence in areas where it would not be economically or practically viable to have conventional Army units - most notably [[northern Canada]].

{{Main|Paramilitary forces of China|Militia (China)}}

China's current [[Paramilitary forces of China#Militia|militia]] falls under the leadership of the [[Communist Party of China]] (CPC), and forms part of the Chinese armed forces. Under the command of the military organs, it undertakes such jobs as war preparation services, security and defense operational tasks and assistance in maintaining [[social order]] and public security.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://english.gov.cn/2005-09/02/content_28491.htm |title=The Components of the Armed Forces |publisher=English.gov.cn |date= |accessdate=2014-02-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120809155545/http://english.gov.cn/2005-09/02/content_28491.htm |archivedate=2012-08-09 |df= }}</ref>

Historically, militias of varying levels of ability have existed in China, organized on a village and [[Chinese clan|clan]] level, especially during periods of instability and in areas subject to pirate and bandit attack. When the British attempted to take control of the [[New Territories]] in 1898, they were resisted by the local militias which had been formed for mutual defence against [[Piracy|pirate]] raids. Although ultimately defeated, the militias' dogged resistance convinced the British to make concessions to the [[Indigenous inhabitants (Hong Kong)|indigenous inhabitants]] allowing them to preserve inheritance, property and marriage rights and customs throughout most of the period of the British rule.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://hk.geocities.com/yingconghk/NT.htm |title=The reason behind the resistance by the New Territories inhabitants against British takeover in 1899 |publisher=Web.archive.org |accessdate=2014-02-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091027114956/http://hk.geocities.com/yingconghk/NT.htm |archivedate=October 27, 2009 }}</ref><ref>[http://www.districtcouncils.gov.hk/tp_d/pdf/TaiPo%20Book%20(Eng%20Ver)/TaiPo%20Book%20(Eng%20Ver)%2008%20Chap%2003.pdf ]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110609192135/http://www.districtcouncils.gov.hk/tp_d/pdf/TaiPo%20Book%20%28Eng%20Ver%29/TaiPo%20Book%20%28Eng%20Ver%29%2008%20Chap%2003.pdf |date=June 9, 2011 }}</ref>

{{see also|White Guard (Finland)}}
While [[Conscription in Finland|Finland employs conscription]], they do not have separate militia units: all units are organized by and under the command of the [[Finnish Defence Forces]]. All men belong to the reserve until age 50 or 60 depending on rank, and may be called up in case of mobilization. Each reservist is assigned a position in a unit to be activated. However, since 2004, the FDF does have [[Territorial Forces (Finland)|territorial forces]], organized along the lines of regular infantry formations, which are composed of volunteers. Furthermore, long-range patrol units ([[Sissi (Finnish light infantry)|sissi troops]], a type of [[special forces]]) are assigned to local troops.

In history, before Finland became independent, two types of local militias existed: the White Guards and Red Guards, which were non-socialists and socialists, respectively. In the [[Finnish Civil War]] (1918) the White Guards founded the White Army, which was victorious over the Red Guards. White Guards continued their existence as a volunteer militia until the Second World War. In some cases their activity found overt political expression as in the [[Mäntsälä rebellion]]. However, in 1934 separate wartime White Guard units were dissolved and in the Second World War they served at the front, dispersed in regular units. They were dissolved as a condition of peace after the Continuation War.

==France==
The first notable militia in French history was the resistance of the [[Gaul]]s to invasion by the [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] until they were defeated by Julius Caesar.<ref>Gilliver, Kate. ''Caesar's Gallic Wars 58–50 BC.'' London: Osprey Publishing, 2002. {{ISBN|0-415-96858-5}}</ref> Centuries later, [[Joan of Arc]] organized and led a militia until her capture and execution in 1431. This settled the succession to the French crown and laid the basis for the formation of the modern nation of France.<ref>''Joan of Arc: Her Story'', by Régine Pernoud (Author), Marie-Véronique Clin (Author), Jeremy duQuesnay Adams (Translator), Palgrave Macmillan (1999), {{ISBN|0-312-22730-2}}</ref>

During the [[French Revolution]] the [[National Guard (France)|National Guard]] was a political home defense militia. The [[levée en masse]] was a conscription army used during the Revolutionary and [[Napoleonic Wars]].

At the time of the [[Franco-Prussian War]], the Parisian National Guard engaged the Prussian Army and later rebelled against the Versailles Army under Marshal McMahon.

Under German occupation during World War II, a militia usually called the [[French Resistance]] emerged to conduct a guerrilla war of attrition against German forces and prepare the way for the [[D-Day]] Allied Invasion of France.<ref>[[David Schoenbrun]], ''Soldiers of the Night: The Story of the French Resistance'', New American Library, 1980. {{ISBN|0-452-00612-0}}</ref> The Resistance militia were opposed by the collaborationist [[French Militia]]—the paramilitary police force of the [[Vichy France|German puppet state of Vichy]].

Although defunct from 1871 until 2016, the French National Guard has now been reestablished for homeland security purposes.<ref name="militarytimes">[http://www.militarytimes.com/articles/france-creates-national-guard-to-battle-terrorism France creates National Guard to battle terrorism]</ref>

==Germany==
The earliest reports of Germanic militias was the system of [[Hundred (division)|hundreds]] described in 98 AD by the Roman historian [[Tacitus]] as the ''centeni.'' They were similar in nature to the [[Anglo-Saxons|Anglo-Saxon]] ''[[fyrd]]''.
[[File:Luetzows verwegene jagd aquarellreproduktion 1900.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Lützow Free Corps]] during the [[Napoleonic Wars]]. During the Napoleonic Wars, the [[Freikorps]] referred to volunteer forces that fought against the French.]]
[[Freikorps]] ([[German language|German]] for "Free Corps") was originally applied to voluntary armies. The first freikorps were recruited by [[Frederick II of Prussia]] during the [[Seven Years' War]]. These troops were regarded as unreliable by regular armies, so they were mainly used as sentries and for minor duties. During the Napoleonic occupation, organizations such as the Lutzow Freikorps fought against the occupiers and later joined the allied forces as regular soldiers.

However, after 1918, the term was used for [[nationalist]] [[paramilitary]] organizations that sprang up around [[Germany]] as soldiers returned in defeat from [[World War I]]. They were one of the many [[Weimar paramilitary groups]] active during that time. They received considerable support from [[Gustav Noske]], the German Defence Minister who used them to crush the [[Spartakist League]] with enormous violence, including the murders of [[Karl Liebknecht]] and [[Rosa Luxemburg]] on January{{nbsp}}15, 1919. Militia were also used to put down the [[Bavarian Soviet Republic]] in 1919. They were officially "disbanded" in 1920, resulting in the ill-fated [[Kapp Putsch]] in March 1920. The ''Einwohnerwehr'', active in Germany from 1919 to 1921 was a paramilitary citizens' militia consisting of hundreds of thousands of mostly former servicemen.<ref>Campbell, Bruce: ''The Sa Generals and the Rise of Nazism'', Page 99.

In 1921, the Berlin government dissolved the ''Einwohnerwehr''.

[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 146-1971-033-15, Vorbeimarsch des Volkssturms an Goebbels, Berlin.jpg|thumb|The [[Volkssturm]] was a national militia formed by [[Nazi Germany]] in the last months of [[World War II]].]]
In 1921 the Nazi Party created the [[Sturmabteilung]] (SA; Storm Detachment; Brownshirts), which was the first paramilitary wing of the Nazi Party and served as a Nazi militia whose initial assignment was to protect Nazi leaders at rallies and assemblies. The SA also took part in street battles against the forces of rival political parties and violent actions against Jews. From the SA sprung the [[Schutzstaffel]] (SS; Protective Squadron) which grew to become one of the largest and most powerful groups in [[Nazi Germany]], which Reichsführer-SS [[Heinrich Himmler]] (the leader of the SS from 1929) envisioned as an elite group of guards. The [[Waffen-SS]], the military branch of the SS, became a de facto fourth branch of the [[Wehrmacht]].<ref name="Benz">{{cite book|author=Wolfgang Benz|title=A Concise History of the Third Reich |date=2007|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=978-0520253834|page=}}</ref>

In 1944–1945, as World War II came to a close in Europe, the German high command deployed increasing numbers of [[Volkssturm]] units to combat duties. These regiments were composed of men, women and children too old, young or otherwise unfit for service in the Wehrmacht (German Regular Army).<ref>Yelton, David K., ''Hitler's Volkssturm: The Nazi Militia and the Fall of Germany, 1944–1945''. University Press of Kansas, 2002. {{ISBN|0700611924}}</ref> Their primary role was assisting the army with fortification duties and digging anti-tank ditches. As the shortage of manpower became severe, they were used as front line infantry, most often in urban settings. Due to the physical state of members, almost non-existent training and shortage of weapons, there was not much the Volkssturm could do except act like shields for regular army units. However, armed with [[Panzerfaust]]s and deeply entrenched, a unit of Volkssturm could cause serious trouble for Soviet armor.{{weasel inline|date=February 2018}}

==Israel==
In modern times, the [[Israel Defense Forces]] (IDF) is often described as a heavily armed militia, not a full-fledged army, since it is legally and publicly viewed as a defensive force only, and since it relies heavily on the reserve duty of Israeli citizens who are annually called to service for set periods of time, rather than on professional, full-time soldiers.<ref>Bregman, Ahron (2002).

From the [[Treaty of Waitangi]] in 1840 until 1844 small detachments of [[British Army|British Imperial troops]] based in New Zealand were the only military. This changed as a result of the [[Flagstaff War]],<ref>Bay of Islands, Daily Southern Cross, vol 2 issue 101, 22 March 1845, p2</ref> with the colonial government passing a Militia Act on 25 March 1845.<ref>Militia Ordinance, Daily Southern Cross, Vol 2 issue 103, 5 April 1845, p2</ref> Militia units were formed in [[Auckland]], [[Wellington]], [[New Plymouth]], and [[Nelson, New Zealand|Nelson]].

Many localized militia saw service, together with British Imperial troops, during the [[New Zealand land wars]]. In the late nineteenth century a system of local Volunteer militias evolved throughout the country. These were semi-trained but uniformed and administered by a small number of regular "Imperial" officers.<ref>{{cite book|first=Wayne|last=Stack|page=6|title=The New Zealand Expeditionary Force in World War I|isbn=978-1-84908-539-7}}</ref>

==Portugal==
[[Portugal]] had a long tradition in the use of militias for national defense. Between the 12th and 16th centuries, the municipal militias – composed of [[Spear (weapon)|spear]]men, [[Pike (weapon)|pike]]men, horsemen, slingers, javelineers, archers, [[crossbow]]men and later [[arquebus]]iers – constituted the main component of the [[Portuguese Army|Portuguese Royal Army]], together with smaller military forces from the [[King of Portugal|King]], the [[Military order (monastic society)|military order]]s and the feudal lords.

After some failed previous attempts, in 1570 King [[Sebastian of Portugal]] created the ''[[Ordenanças]]'', a centrally managed military territorial organization that would replace the municipal militias and became the basis of a national army. After 60 years of foreign domination (1580–1640), the ''Ordenanças'' were reorganized for the [[Portuguese Restoration War]]. The Portuguese Army was then organized in three lines, with the 2nd and 3rd being militia forces. The ''Ordenanças'' became the 3rd line and acted both as a territorial draft organization for the 1st and 2nd line troops and as a kind of home guard for local defense. The 2nd line was made of the auxiliary troops, also militia units with the role of regional defense. In the end of the 18th century, the auxiliary troops were renamed "Militias".

In the [[Peninsular War]], the Militia regiments and the Ordenanças units had an important role in the defense of the country against the Napoleonic invader army. Still in the 19th century, the Militia units also had an important role in the [[Liberal Wars]], with the majority of those troops fighting on the side of King [[Miguel of Portugal|Miguel]]. Besides the regular militias, a number of volunteer militia units were formed to fight on both sides of the war.

With the establishment of the constitutional regime, the old Militias and ''Ordenanças'' were replaced by a single national militia force, the National Guard. However, the National Guard revealed itself an ineffective and undisciplined force. Their units became highly politicized, being involved in a number of conspiracies and coups. The National Guard having less and less confidence from the authorities, became extinct in 1847, terminating a long tradition of national militias in Portugal.

During the 20th century, some experiments with militia type forces were made. From 1911 to 1926, the Portuguese Army was organized as a militia army. Also, in 1936, the [[Estado Novo (Portugal)|''Estado Novo'']] regime created the [[Portuguese Legion (Estado Novo)|Portuguese Legion]] as a political volunteer militia, dedicated to the fight against the enemies of country and of the social order. From World War II, the Portuguese Legion assumed the responsibility for [[civil defense]], this becoming its main role during the [[Cold War]], until its extinction in 1974.

==Russia and the Soviet Union==
[[File:Знамя Санкт-Петербургского ополчения 1812 года.jpg|thumb|Banner of [[Saint Petersburg]] militia from [[Napoleon]]'s invasion of Russia.]]
{{Unreferenced section|date=July 2008}}
Neither the [[Russian Empire]], nor the [[Soviet Union]] ever had an organised force that could be equated to a militia. Instead a form of organisation that predated the Russian state was used during national emergencies called [[Narodnoe Opolcheniye]] (People's Regimentation). More comparable to the English [[Leidang|Fyrd]], it was a popular voluntary joining of the local полк [[Regiment#Russian Army|polk]], or a regiment, though it had no regular established strength or officers, these usually elected from prominent local citizens. Although these spontaneously created popular forces had participated in several major wars of the Russian Empire, including in combat, they were not obligated to serve for more than one year, and notably departed for home during the [[War of the Sixth Coalition|1813 campaign in Germany]]. On only one occasion, during the [[military history of the Soviet Union]], the Narodnoe Opolcheniye was incorporated into the regular forces of the [[Red Army]], notably in [[List of infantry divisions of the Soviet Union 1917–1957#Narodnoe Opolcheniye divisions|Leningrad and Moscow]].

The term [[Militsiya]] in Russia and former [[Eastern bloc|Communist Bloc]] nations was specifically used to refer to the civilian [[police force]], and should not be confused with the conventional western definition of militia. The term, as used in this context, dated from post-revolutionary Russia in late 1917 and was intended to draw a distinction between the new Soviet law enforcement agencies and the disbanded Tsarist police. In some of these states militia was renamed back to police such as [[Ukraine]] while in the other states it remains such as [[Belarus]]. In Russia it was renamed to Police (in {{lang-ru|Полиция}}, ''Politsiya'') in March 2011.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://georgianjournal.ge/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=966:russian-police-bill-to-come-into-force-next-spring&catid=20:our-man-in-moscow&Itemid=27 |title=Russian Police Bill to Come into Force Next Spring |publisher=Georgianjournal.ge |date=2010-11-03 |accessdate=2012-08-06}}</ref>

==Sri Lanka==
The first militias formed in [[Sri Lanka]] were by Lankan Kings, who raised militia armies for their military campaigns both within and outside the island. This was due to the reason that the Kings never maintained a standing army instead had a [[Royal Guard]] during peacetime and formed a militia in wartime.

When the [[Portugal|Portuguese]] who were the first colonial power to dominate the island raised local militias under the command of local leaders known as [[Mudaliyars]]. These militias took part in the many [[Portugal|Portuguese]] campaigns against the Lankan Kings. The Dutch continued to employ these militias but due to their unreliability tended to favor employing [[Switzerland|Swiss]] and [[Malays (ethnic group)|Malay]] [[mercenaries]] in their campaigns in the island.
[[File:Sri Lanka Military 0092.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Sri Lanka Civil Security Force]] is a paramilitary militia tasked to serve as an [[auxiliary police|auxiliary]] to the [[Sri Lanka Police]].]]
The [[British Empire]] then ousted the [[Netherlands|Dutch]] from the coastal areas of the country, and sought to conquer the independent [[Kingdom of Kandy|Kandyan Kingdom]]. In 1802, the British became the first foreign power to raise a regular unit of [[Sinhalese people|Sinhalese]] with British officers, which was named the 2nd Ceylon Regiment, also known as the [[Sepoy|Sepoy Corps]]. It fought alongside British troops in the [[Kandyan Wars|Kandyan wars]]. After the [[Matale Rebellion]] led by [[Puran Appu]] in 1848, in which a number of Sinhalese recruits defected to the side of the rebels, the recruitment of Sinhalese to the British forces was temporarily halted and the Ceylon Regiments disbanded.

In 1861, the [[Ceylon Light Infantry Volunteers]] were raised as a militia, but soon became a [[military reserve force]]. This became the [[Ceylon Defence Force]] in 1910 and consisted of militia units. These were the [[Colombo Town Guard]] and the [[Ceylon Garrison Artillery|Town Guard Artillery]] formed during the two world wars.

With the escalation of the [[Sri Lankan Civil War]], local villagers under threat of attack were formed into localized militia to protect their families and homes.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.sundayobserver.lk/2008/02/17/sec02.asp |title=Security News &#124; Sundayobserver.lk – Sri Lanka |publisher=Sundayobserver.lk |date=2008-02-17 |accessdate=2014-02-22 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140226064150/http://www.sundayobserver.lk/2008/02/17/sec02.asp |archive-date=2014-02-26 |dead-url=yes |df= }}</ref> According to the Sri Lankan Military these militias were formed after "massacres done by the [[LTTE]]" and in the early 1990s they were reformed as the [[Sri Lankan Home Guard]].

==Sweden==
As of 2012, the [[Swedish Home Guard]] consists of 22,000 organized into 40 [[light infantry]] [[battalions]] of 300–700 Guardsmen. These battalions are then organised into [[Company (military unit)|companies]], usually one for every [[municipality]]. The main task of the battalions is to guard vital military and civilian installations throughout the country.

In 2001, the Rapid Response units numbered around 5,000 soldiers of the total of 42,000. As of 2014, the majority of the force, 17,000 out of 22,000 soldiers will be in Rapid Response units. The decrease in number of troops comes with an equal increase in quality and modern equipment. These units are motorized and are ready to be mobilized more often, than other Home Guard units. Rapid response units have more combat tasks compared to the rest of the Home Guard, including escort duties. Some battalions located near the coast also have marine companies equipped with [[Combat Boat 90]]. A few battalions have recently set up 'specialized' companies to evaluate the possibility to add new abilities to the Home Guard. These are at the time of writing eight reconnaissance/intelligence companies, four [[CBRN]]-platoons, a movcon platoon, an engineer platoon, and a [[military police]] unit.

==Switzerland==
{{Main|Conscription in Switzerland}}

One of the best known and ancient militias is the [[Military of Switzerland|Swiss Armed Forces]]. [[Switzerland]] has long maintained, proportionally, the second largest military force in the world, with about half the proportional amount of reserve forces of the [[Israeli Defense Forces]], a militia of some 33% of the total population. The "[[militia principle]]" of public duties is central to Swiss political culture and not limited to military issues. For example, in most municipalities it is common to serve as a conscript fire fighter in the [[Compulsory Fire Service|Compulsory Fire Department]].

Article 58.1 of the April{{nbsp}}18, 1999, Federal Constitution of the Swiss Confederation (official, French version) provides that "Switzerland has an army. It is primarily organised according to the principle of a militia." However, under the country's militia system, professional soldiers constitute about 5 percent of military personnel. In 1995, the number of soldiers was reduced to 400,000 (including reservists, amounting to some 5.6% of the population) and again in 2004, to 200,000 (including 80,000 reservists, or 2.5% of the population). However, the Swiss Militia continues to consist of most of the adult male population (with voluntary participation by women) who are required to keep an assault rifle at home and to periodically engage in combat and marksmanship training.<ref>[http://www.constitution.org/mil/swiss_rpt.pdf The Swiss Report: A special study for Western Goals Foundation], Gen.

===Origins===
The obligation to serve in the militia in England derives from a [[common law]] tradition, and dates back to [[Anglo-Saxons|Anglo-Saxon]] times. The tradition was that all able-bodied males were liable to be called out to serve in one of two organisations. These were the [[Posse comitatus (common law)|posse comitatus]], an ''ad hoc'' assembly called together by a law officer to apprehend lawbreakers, and the [[fyrd]],<ref>Oxford English Dictionary. Second Edition 1989</ref> a military body intended to preserve internal order or defend the locality against an invader. The latter developed into the militia, and was usually embodied by a [[Warrant (law)|royal warrant]].<ref>The History of English Law Before the Time of Edward I, Pollock and Maitland, Cambridge U. Pr. (1898)</ref> Service in each organisation involved different levels of preparedness.<ref>[[Century Dictionary]] (1891) articles on ''posse comitatus'' and ''militia''.</ref>

===16th and 17th centuries===
With the decay of the feudal system and the military revolution of the 16th century, the militia began to become an important institution in English life. It was organised on the basis of the [[Historic counties of England|shire county]], and was one of the responsibilities of the [[Lord Lieutenant]], a royal official (usually a trusted nobleman). Each of the [[hundred (division)|county hundreds]] was likewise the responsibility of a [[Deputy Lieutenant]], who relayed orders to the [[justices of the peace]] or [[magistrates]]. Every parish furnished a quota of eligible men, whose names were recorded on [[Muster (military)|muster rolls]]. Likewise, each household was assessed for the purpose of finding weapons, armour, horses, or their financial equivalent, according to their status. The militia was supposed to be [[Muster (military)|mustered]] for training purposes from time to time, but this was rarely done. The militia regiments were consequently ill-prepared for an emergency, and could not be relied upon to serve outside their own counties. This state of affairs concerned many people. Consequently, an elite force was created, composed of members of the militia who were prepared to meet regularly for military training and exercise. These were formed into trained band regiments, particularly in the [[City of London]], where the [[Artillery Ground]] was used for training. The [[trained bands]] performed an important role in the [[English Civil War]] on the side of parliament, in marching to raise the siege of [[Gloucester]] (5 September 1643). Except for the London trained bands, both sides in the Civil War made little use of the militia, preferring to recruit their armies by other means.{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}}<!-- Then one has to explain away their use at the Battle of Worcester: "The Parliamentary militia were sent home within a week. Cromwell, who had ridiculed 'such stuff' six months ago, knew them better now. 'Your new raised forces,' he wrote to the House, 'did perform singular good service, for which they deserve a very high estimation and acknowledgment.'"

===Militia in the British Empire===
{{main|Militia (British Dominions and Crown Colonies)}}
[[File:John Smith 1624 map of Bermuda with Forts 01.jpg|thumb|Captain [[John Smith of Jamestown|John Smith's]] 1624 map of the Somers Isles ([[Bermuda]]), showing [[St. George's, Bermuda|St. George's Town]] and related fortifications, including the [[Castle Islands Fortifications, Bermuda|Castle Islands Fortifications]] with their garrisons of militiamen]]
As successful English settlement of North America began to take place in 1607 in the face of the hostile intentions of the powerful Spanish, and of the native populations, it became immediately necessary to raise militia amongst the settlers. The militia in [[Jamestown, Virginia|Jamestown]] saw constant action against the [[Powhatan|Powhatan Federation]] and other native polities. In the [[London Company|Virginia Company]]'s other outpost, [[Bermuda]], fortification began immediately in 1612. A Spanish attack in 1614 was repulsed by two shots fired from the incomplete [[Castle Islands Fortifications, Bermuda|Castle Islands Fortifications]] manned by [[Bermuda Militias 1612–1815|Bermudian Militiamen]]. In the Nineteenth century, ''Fortress Bermuda'' would become Britain's ''Gibraltar of the West'', heavily fortified by a Regular Army garrison to protect the [[Royal Navy]]'s headquarters and dockyard in the Western Atlantic.

In the 17th Century, however, Bermuda's defence was left entirely in the hands of the Militia. In addition to requiring all male civilians to train and serve in the militia of their Parish, the Bermudian Militia included a standing body of trained artillerymen to garrison the numerous fortifications which ringed ''New London'' ([[St. George's, Bermuda|St. George's]]). This standing body was created by recruiting volunteers, and by sentencing criminals to serve as punishment. The Bermudian militiamen were called out on numerous occasions of war, and, on one notable occasion, to quell rioting privateers. The 1707 [[Acts of Union 1707|Acts of Union]] made Bermudian and other English militiamen ''British''. The Militia in Bermuda came to include a Troop of Horse (mounted infantry) and served alongside volunteers and (from 1701) a small body of regulars. The Militia faded away after the American War of 1812 when the [[Parliament of Bermuda]] declined to renew the Militia Act. This resulted from the build-up of the regular army [[Bermuda Garrison]] along with Bermuda's development as the headquarters and [[Royal Naval Dockyard, Bermuda|dockyard]] of the [[North America and West Indies Station]] of the [[Royal Navy]], which made the militia seem excess to need. Vast sums of the Imperial defence expenditure were lavished on fortifying Bermuda during the Nineteenth Century and the British Government cajoled, implored, begged, and threatened the colonial legislature for 80 years before it raised a militia and volunteer units (in 1894 and 1894 respectively). Although the militia had historically been an infantry force, many units in Britain had been re-tasked as militia artillery from the 1850s onward due to the increased importance of the coastal artillery defences and the new militia unit in Bermuda followed suit. Titled the ''Bermuda Militia Artillery'', it was badged and uniformed as part of the Royal Artillery, and tasked with the garrison artillery role, manning coastal batteries. As in Britain, recruitment was of volunteers who engaged for terms of service, whereas the Bermuda Volunteer Rifle Corps was organised on the same lines as volunteer rifle corps in Britain. Recruitment to the BVRC was restricted to whites, but the BMA recruited primarily coloured (those who were not entirely of European heritage) other ranks, though its officers were all white until 1953. Neither unit was reorganised in 1908 when the Militia, Volunteer Force and Yeomanry in Britain merged into the Territorial Force, but the BVRC was re-organised as a territorial in 1921 and the BMA in 1926. The BVRC name was not modified to Bermuda Rifles until 1951, however, and the Bermuda Militia Artillery (and from 1939 the Bermuda Militia Infantry) continued to be titled as militia until amalgamated with the Bermuda Rifles in 1965 to form the [[Bermuda Regiment]].

In British India, a special class of militia was established in 1907. This took the form of the [[Frontier Corps]], which consisted of locally recruited full-time auxiliaries under British officers. Their role combined the functions of tribal police and border guards deployed along the [[Military history of the North-West Frontier|North-West Frontier]]. Regional units included the [[Zhob Militia]], the Kurram Militia, and the Chagai Militia. After 1946 the Frontier Corps became part of the modern Pakistan Army.

===Political issues===
Until the [[Glorious Revolution]] in 1688 [[the Crown]] and Parliament were in strong disagreement. The [[English Civil War]] left a rather unusual military legacy. Both [[British Whig Party|Whigs]] and [[Tories]] distrusted the creation of a large [[standing army]] not under civilian control. The former feared that it would be used as an instrument of royal tyranny. The latter had memories of the [[New Model Army]] and the anti-monarchical social and political revolution that it brought about. Both preferred a small standing army under civilian control for defensive deterrence and to prosecute foreign wars, a large navy as the first line of national defence, and a militia composed of their neighbours as additional defence and to preserve domestic order.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}

Consequently, the [[English Bill of Rights]] (1689) declared, amongst other things: "that the raising or keeping a standing army within the kingdom in time of peace, unless it be with consent of Parliament, is against law..." and "that the subjects which are [[Protestant]]s may have arms for their defence suitable to their conditions and as allowed by law." This implies that they are fitted to serve in the militia, which was intended to serve as a counterweight to the standing army and preserve civil liberties against the use of the army by a tyrannical monarch or government.

The Crown still (in the British constitution) controls the use of the army. This ensures that officers and enlisted men swear an oath to a politically neutral head of state, and not to a politician. While the funding of the standing army subsists on annual financial votes by parliament, the [[Mutiny Act]], superseded by the Army Act, and now the [[Armed Forces Act]] is also renewed on an annual basis by Parliament.{{Citation needed|date=November 2007}} If it lapses, the legal basis for enforcing discipline disappears, and soldiers lose their legal indemnity for acts committed under orders.{{Citation needed|date=November 2007}}

With the creation of the [[British Empire]], militias were also raised in the colonies, where little support could be provided by regular forces. Overseas militias were first raised in [[Jamestown, Virginia|Jamestown]], [[Virginia]], and in [[Bermuda]], where the [[Bermuda Militias 1612–1815|Bermuda Militia]] followed over the next two centuriesa similar trajectory to that in Britain.

===18th century and the Acts of Union===
In 1707 the [[Acts of Union 1707|Acts of Union]] united the [[Kingdom of England]] with the [[Kingdom of Scotland]]. The [[Royal Scots Navy|Scottish navy]] was incorporated into the Royal Navy. The Scottish military (as opposed to naval) forces merged with the English, with pre-existing regular Scottish regiments maintaining their identities, though command of the new British Army was from England. How this affected militias either side of the border is unclear.

====British Militia====
{{Main|Militia (Great Britain)|Militia (United Kingdom)}}
[[File:Thomas Rowlandson - A Review of the Northapmton Militia at Brackley - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|A review of the [[Northampton Militia]]. Formed in 1763, it men were selected by ballot to serve for a period of time.]]
The [[Militia Act of 1757]] created a more professional force. Better records were kept, and the men were selected by ballot to serve for longer periods; specific provision was made for members of the [[Religious Society of Friends]], [[Quakers]], to be exempted, as [[conscientious objector]]s, from compulsory enlistment in the militia. Proper uniforms and better weapons were provided, and the force was 'embodied' from time to time for training sessions.

The militia was widely embodied at various times during the French and [[Napoleonic Wars]]. It served at several vulnerable locations, and was particularly stationed on the South Coast and in [[Ireland]]. A number of camps were held at [[Brighton]], where the militia regiments were reviewed by the [[Prince Regent]]. (This is the origin of the song "Brighton Camp".) The militia could not be compelled to serve overseas, but it was seen as a training reserve for the army, as [[bounty (reward)|bounties]] were offered to men who opted to 'exchange' from the militia to the [[regular army]].

====Irish militia====
The [[Parliament of Ireland]] passed an [[act of parliament|act]] in 1715 raising regiments of militia in each county and [[county corporate]]. Membership was restricted to [[Protestant]]s between the ages of 16 and 60. In 1793, during the [[Napoleonic Wars]], the Irish militia were reorganised to form thirty-seven county and city regiments. While officers of the reorganised force were Protestant, membership of the other ranks was now made available to members of all denominations.

====Scottish militia====
In the late 17th century came calls for the resurrection of militia in Scotland that had the understated aim of protecting the rights of Scots from English oppression.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.constitution.org/fletchr/fletchr.htm |title=Andrew Fletcher: A Discourse of Government with relation to Militias |publisher=Constitution.org |date= |accessdate=2014-02-22}}</ref> The 1757 Militia Act did not apply in Scotland. The old traditional system continued, so that militia regiments only existed in some places. This was resented by some and the Militia Club, soon to become [[the Poker Club]], was formed to promote the raising of a Scottish militia. This and several other Edinburgh clubs became the crucible of the [[Scottish Enlightenment]]. The Militia Act 1797 empowered Scottish Lord Lieutenants to raise and command militia regiments in each of the "Counties, Stewartries, Cities, and Places" under their jurisdiction.

===19th century===
[[File:Prince of Wales reviewing the Norfolk Artillery Militia.jpg|thumb|The [[Prince of Wales]] reviewing the [[Norfolk Militia]], 1872. By the mid-19th century, the militia had become a volunteer force.]]
Although muster rolls were prepared as late as 1820, the element of compulsion was abandoned, and the militia transformed into a volunteer force, revived by the [[List of Acts of the Parliament of the United Kingdom, 1840–59#15 .26 16 Vict.|Militia Act of 1852]]. It was intended to be seen as an alternative to the army. Men would volunteer and undertake basic training for several months at an army depot. Thereafter, they would return to civilian life, but report for regular periods of military training (usually on the weapons ranges) and an annual two-week training camp. In return, they would receive military pay and a financial retainer, a useful addition to their civilian wage. Of course, many saw the annual camp as the equivalent of a paid holiday. The militia thus appealed to agricultural labourers, colliers and the like, men in [[Contingent work|casual occupations]], who could leave their civilian job and pick it up again. Until 1852 the militia were an entirely [[infantry]] force, but from that year a number of county infantry regiments were converted to [[artillery]] and new ones raised. In 1877 the militia of [[Anglesey]] and [[Monmouthshire (historic)|Monmouthshire]] were converted to engineers. Under the [[Childers reforms|reforms]], introduced by [[Secretary of State for War]] [[Hugh Childers]] in 1881, the remaining militia infantry regiments were redesignated as numbered battalions of regiments of the line, ranking after the two regular battalions. Typically, an English, Welsh or Scottish regiment would have two militia battalions (the 3rd and 4th) and Irish regiments three (numbered 3rd–5th).

The militia must not be confused with the volunteer units created in a wave of enthusiasm in the second half of the nineteenth century. In contrast with the [[Volunteer Force (Great Britain)|Volunteer Force]], and the similar [[Yeomanry]] Cavalry, they were considered rather plebeian.

===The Special Reserve===
[[File:Volunteer with Me for the Territorial Army Art.IWMPST14588.jpg|thumb|Recruitment poster for the British [[Territorial Army (United Kingdom)|Territorial Army]] during World War II. The reserve force was formed after the militias were reorganized in 1907.]]
{{main|Special Reserve}}
The militia was transformed into the Special Reserve by the [[Territorial and Reserve Forces Act 1907|military reforms]] of [[Haldane Reforms|Haldane]] in the reforming post 1906 Liberal government. In 1908 the militia infantry battalions were redesignated as "reserve" and a number were amalgamated or disbanded. Numbered [[Territorial Force]] battalions, ranking after the Special Reserve, were formed from the volunteer units at the same time. Altogether, 101 infantry battalions, 33 artillery regiments and two engineer regiments of special reservists were formed.<ref>Units of the Militia to be transferred to the Special Reserve, published as a schedule to an [[Order in Council]] made 9 April 1908, ''The London Gazette'', 10 April 1908</ref> Upon mobilisation, the special reserve units would be formed at the depot and continue training while guarding vulnerable points in Britain. The special reserve units remained in Britain throughout the [[First World War]], but their rank and file did not, since the object of the special reserve was to supply drafts of replacements for the overseas units of the regiment. The original militiamen soon disappeared, and the battalions simply became training units. The Special Reserve reverted to its militia designation in 1921, then to Supplementary Reserve in 1924, though the units were effectively placed in "suspended animation" until disbanded in 1953.

===The militiamen===
The name was briefly revived in the [[Military Training Act 1939]], in the aftermath of the [[Munich Crisis]]. [[Leslie Hore-Belisha]], Secretary of State for War, wished to introduce a limited form of [[Conscription in the United Kingdom|conscription]], not known in peacetime Britain since the militia of the early 19th century and previously. It was thought that calling the conscripts 'militiamen' would make this more acceptable, as it would render them distinct from the rest of the army. Only single men aged 20 up to the day before their 22nd birthday were to be conscripted, for six months full-time training before discharge into the reserve (with a free suit of civilian clothing). Although the first intake was called up in late July 1939, the declaration of war on 3 September entailed implementation of full-time conscription for all men aged 18–41, superseding the militia, never to be revived.

===Modern survivals===
[[File:Royal Visit 2012 0010.jpg|thumb|A non-commissioned officer of the [[Royal Militia of the Island of Jersey]]. The unit is one of two regiments in the Territorial Army that maintain their militia designation.]]
Three units still maintain their militia designation in the [[British Army]].These are the [[Royal Monmouthshire Royal Engineers]] (formed in 1539), the [[Royal Jersey Militia|Jersey Field Squadron (The Royal Militia Island of Jersey)]] (formed in 1337), and the Royal Alderney Militia (created in the 13th century and reformed in 1984). Additionally, the [[Atholl Highlanders]] are a ceremonial infantry militia maintained by the [[Duke of Atholl]]—they are the only legal [[private army]] in Europe.

===Other British militias===
Various other part-time, home defence organisations have been raised during times of crisis or perceived threat, although without the word "militia" in their title. These have included:
*[[British Volunteer Corps|Volunteer Corps]], part of the [[British anti-invasion preparations of 1803–1805]]
*[[Fencibles]], part of the [[British anti-invasion preparations of 1803–1805]]
*[[Sea Fencibles]], a volunteer coastal defence force in the [[Napoleonic Wars]]
*[[Yeomanry]], volunteer cavalry initially raised in the Napoleonic Wars
*[[Volunteer Force (Great Britain)|Volunteer Force]], from 1857 to 1908
*[[Volunteer Training Corps (World War I)|Volunteer Training Corps]], 1914 to 1918
*[[National Defence Companies]], 1936 to 1939
*[[Home Guard (United Kingdom)|Home Guard]], initially Local Defence Volunteers, 1940 to 1944 and 1951 to 1957
*[[Ulster Defence Regiment]], 1970 to 1992
*[[Home Service Force]], 1982 to 1992

===The Troubles and Irish War of Independence===
{{See also|The Troubles|Irish War of Independence}}

The various non-state paramilitary groups involved in the 20th-century conflicts in [[Northern Ireland]] and the island of [[Ireland]], such as the various [[Irish Republican Army]] groups and [[Ulster loyalism|loyalist]] paramilitaries, could also be described as militias and are occasionally referred to as such.

The [[Ulster Defence Regiment]] (UDR) was a locally raised professional militia instituted by an [[Act of Parliament]] in December 1969, becoming operational on 1 April 1970. Created as a [[Nonpartisan|non-partisan]] force to defend Northern Ireland "against armed attack or sabotage", it eventually peaked at 11 battalions with 7,559 men and women. 197 soldiers of the UDR, including four women, were killed as active servicemen, with a further 61 killed after leaving the regiment, mostly by the [[Provisional Irish Republican Army]]. As a result of defence cuts it was eventually reduced to 7 battalions before being amalgamated with the [[Royal Irish Rangers]] in 1992 to form the "Home Service Battalions" of the [[Royal Irish Regiment (1992)|Royal Irish Regiment]].

==United States==
{{Main|Militia (United States)}}
The history of militia in the [[United States]] dates from the colonial era, such as in the American Revolutionary War.<ref>{{cite web| last=Linder| first=Doug| title=United States vs. Miller (U.S. 1939)| work=Exploring Constitutional Law| publisher=University of Missouri-Kansas City Law School| year=2008| url=http://www.law.umkc.edu/faculty/projects/ftrials/conlaw/millervus.html| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20011123170327/http://www.law.umkc.edu/faculty/projects/ftrials/conlaw/millervus.html| dead-url=yes| archive-date=2001-11-23| accessdate=2008-07-26}}</ref> Based on the English system, colonial militias were drawn from the body of adult male citizens of a community, town, or local region. Because there was no standing English Army before the [[English Civil War]], and subsequently the English Army and later the British Army had few regulars garrisoning North America, colonial militia served a vital role in local conflicts, particularly in the [[French and Indian Wars]]. Before shooting began in the [[American Revolutionary War|American War of Independence]], American revolutionaries took control of the militia system, reinvigorating training and excluding men with [[Loyalist (American Revolution)|Loyalist]] inclinations.<ref>John Shy, "Mobilizing Armed Force in the American Revolution", in John Parker and Carol Urness, eds., ''The American Revolution: A Heritage of Change'' (Minneapolis, 1975), pp. 104–5.</ref> Regulation of the militia was codified by the [[Second Continental Congress]] with the [[Articles of Confederation]]. The revolutionaries also created a full-time regular army—the [[Continental Army]]—but because of manpower shortages the militia provided short-term support to the regulars in the field throughout the war.

In colonial era Anglo-American usage, militia service was distinguished from military service in that the latter was normally a commitment for a fixed period of time of at least a year, for a [[salary]], whereas militia was only to meet a threat, or prepare to meet a threat, for periods of time expected to be short. Militia persons were normally expected to provide their own weapons, equipment, or supplies, although they may later be compensated for losses or expenditures.<ref>Stephen P. Halbrook, "The Right of the People or the Power of the State Bearing Arms, Arming Militias, and the Second Amendment," ''Valparaiso Law Review'', vol. 26, number 1, page 131 (1991).</ref> A related concept is the [[jury]], which can be regarded as a specialized form of militia convened to render a verdict in a court proceeding (known as a petit jury or [[jury|trial jury]]) or to investigate a public matter and render a presentment or indictment ([[grand jury]]).<ref>William E. Nelson, "The Eighteenth-Century Background of John Marshall's Constitutional Jurisprudence," 76 ''Mich. L. Rev''. 893 (1978), ch. 23, 23.

With the [[Philadelphia Convention|Constitutional Convention]] of 1787 and Article 1 Section 8 of the [[United States Constitution]], control of the army and the power to direct the militia of the states was concurrently delegated to the federal [[United States Congress|Congress]].<ref name="Wills 1999">[[Garry Wills|Wills, Garry]] (1999). ''A Necessary Evil, A History of American Distrust of Government''. New York, NY; Simon & Schuster. {{ISBN|0-684-84489-3}}</ref> The [[Militia Clause]]s gave Congress authority for "organizing, arming, and disciplining" the militia, and "governing such Part of them as may be employed in the Service of the United States", with the States retaining authority to appoint officers and to impose the training specified by Congress. Proponents describe a key element in the concept of "militia" was that to be "genuine" it not be a "select militia", composed of an unrepresentative subset of the population. This was an argument presented in the [[Ratification of the United States Constitution|ratification debates]].<ref>''Right to Keep and Bear Arms'', U. S. Senate. [[Paladin Press]] (2001). {{ISBN|1-58160-254-5}}</ref>

The first legislation on the subject was the [[Militia Act of 1792]] which provided, in part:
<blockquote>That each and every free able-bodied white male citizen of the respective States, resident therein, who is or shall be of age of eighteen years, and under the age of forty-five years (except as is herein after excepted) shall severally and respectively be enrolled in the militia,... every citizen, so enrolled and notified, shall, within six months thereafter, provide himself with a good musket or firelock.</blockquote>

[[File:NewYorkStateMilitiaCivilWar.jpg|thumb|Uniformed American militiamen during the American Civil War.]]
During the nineteenth century, each of the states maintained its militia differently, some more than others. American militia saw action in the various [[Indian Wars]], the [[War of 1812]], the [[American Civil War]], and the [[Spanish–American War]]. Sometimes militia units were found to be unprepared, ill-supplied, and unwilling.<ref name="Wills 1999"/><ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=LT4OAAAAIAAJ&pg=PA18&lpg=PA18&dq=spanish+american+war+militia#PPA466,M1 |title=The Spanish–American War |author=Russell Alexander Alger |publisher=Harper & Bros. |date=1901 |accessdate=2014-02-22}}</ref><ref>[[William H.

Their deployment to maintain order in the former Confederate states caused increased resentment among many Southern whites.<ref>Catton, Bruce (2004). ''The Civil War,'' pages 28–29. Mariner Books. {{ISBN|0-618-00187-5}}</ref>

After the [[American Civil War]], secret groups like the [[Ku Klux Klan]] and [[Knights of the White Camellia]] arose quickly across the [[Southern United States|South]], reaching a peak in the late 1860s. Even more significant in terms of effect were private militias: [[Paramilitary|paramilitary organizations]] that formed starting in 1874, including the [[White League]] in [[Louisiana]], which quickly formed chapters in other states; the [[Red Shirts (Southern United States)|Red Shirts]] in [[Mississippi]] in 1875, and with {{clarify |date=April 2016 |text=force in}} [[South Carolina]] and [[North Carolina]]; and other "white line" militias and rifle clubs.

In contrast to the KKK, these paramilitary organizations were open; members were often well known in their communities. Nevertheless, they used force, intimidation, and violence, including murder, to push out Republican officeholders, break up [[Community organizing|organizing]], and suppress [[Freedman|freedmen]]'s voting and civil rights.<ref>[[Nicholas Lemann]], ''Redemption: The Last Battle of the Civil War'', New York: Farrar, Straus & Giroux paperback, 2007, pp.25, 167, 170</ref> The paramilitary groups were described as "the military arm of the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]]" and were instrumental in helping secure Democratic victories in the South in the elections of 1876.<ref>George C. Rable, ''But There Was No Peace: The Role of Violence in the Politics of Reconstruction'', Athens: University of Georgia Press, 1984, p. 132</ref>

[[File:Missouri National Guard training.jpg|thumb|Members of the [[National Guard of the United States]] undergoing self-defense training. The force was created in 1903 as an organized militia.]]
The [[Militia Act of 1903]] divided what had been the militia into what it termed the "organized" militia, created from portions of the former state guards to become state [[United States National Guard|National Guard]] units, and the "unorganized" militia consisting of all males from ages 17 to 45, with the exception of certain officials and others, which is codified in {{UnitedStatesCode|10|311}}. Some states, such as Texas, California, and Ohio, created separate [[state defense force]]s for assistance in local emergencies. Congress later established<ref>National Defense Act Amendments of 1933, Act of June 15, 1933, ch. 87, 48 Stat. 153.</ref> a system of "dual enlistment" for the National Guard, so that anyone who enlisted in the National Guard also enlisted in the [[U.S. Army]].<ref>[http://www.saf.org/LawReviews/WhiskerCitizenSoldier.htm ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120207180224/http://www.saf.org/LawReviews/WhiskerCitizenSoldier.htm |date=February 7, 2012 }}</ref> When the [[U.S. Air Force]] was established as an independent service in 1947, the National Guard was further divided into the [[Army National Guard]] and the [[Air National Guard]]. Under this construct, the 1933 defense act's "dual enlistment" facet was further amended so that enlisted soldiers and commissioned officers in the Army National Guard were also enlisted or commissioned in the Reserve Component of the [[U.S. Army]]. Enlisted airmen and commissioned officers in the Air National Guard were also enlisted or commissioned in the Air Reserve Component (ARC) of the U.S. Air Force.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}

Privately organized citizen militia-related groups blossomed in the mid-1990s, which collectively became known as the [[constitutional militia movement]]. The supporters have not been affiliated with any government organization, although many have been military and law enforcement veterans.{{Request quotation|date=October 2007}}

In its original sense, ''militia'' meant "the state, quality, condition, or activity of being a fighter or warrior." It can be thought of as "combatant activity", "the fighter frame of mind", "the militant mode", "the soldierly status", or "the warrior way".<ref>Beckett, Ian, The Amateur Military Tradition, 1558–1945 (Manchester, 1991).</ref> In this latter usage, a militia is a body of private persons who respond to an emergency threat to public safety, usually one that requires an armed response, but which can also include ordinary law enforcement or disaster responses. The act of bringing to bear arms contextually changes the status of the person, from peaceful citizen, to warrior citizen. The militia is the sum total of persons undergoing this change of state.<ref>Joyce Lee Malcolm, The Right of the People to Keep and Bear Arms: The Common Law Tradition, ''Hastings Constitutional Law Quarterly'', Vol. 10:285–314, 1983</ref> Persons have been said to engage in militia in response to a "call up" by any person aware of the emergent threat requiring the response, and thence to be in "called up" status until the emergency is past.<ref>Joyce Lee Malcolm, ''The Role of the Militia in the Development of the Englishman's Right to be Armed—Clarifying the Legacy'', Royal Historical Society and Humanities Press, 1996</ref> There is no minimum size to militia, and a solitary act of defense, including self-defense, can be thought of as one person calling up himself to defend the community, represented by himself or others, and to enforce the law.{{Request quotation|date=October 2007}}<ref>''Cases & Comments on Criminal Procedure'', Fred E. Inbau and James R. Thompson, Foundation Press, Mineola, NY (1982)</ref> See [[citizen's arrest]] and [[hue and cry]].

===21st century===
In the 2008 decision of the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]], in [[District of Columbia v. Heller]], the ''[[de jure]]'' definition of "militia" as used in [[United States]] [[jurisprudence]] was discussed. The Court's opinion made explicit, in its ''[[Obiter dictum|obiter dicta]]'', that the term "militia," as used in colonial times in this [[Originalism|originalist]] decision, included both the federally organized militia and the citizen-organized militias of the several [[U.S. state|States]]: "... the 'militia' in colonial America consisted of a subset of 'the people'—those who were male, able-bodied, and within a certain age range" (7)... Although the militia consists of all able-bodied men, the federally-organized militia may consist of a subset of them"(23).<ref>{{cite web |last=Scalia |first=Antonin |title=DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA ET AL. v.

The most important previous activity of the Texas Militia was the [[Texas Revolution]] in 1836. Texans declared independence from [[Mexico]] while they were defeated during the [[Battle of the Alamo]], in March 1836. On April 21, 1836, led by [[Sam Houston]], the Militia attacked the [[Mexican Army]] at their camp, in the [[Battle of San Jacinto]] near the present city of [[Houston]]. Following the war, some militia units reorganized into what was later to be known as the [[Texas Ranger Division|Texas Rangers]], which was a private, volunteer effort for several years before becoming an official organization. After Texas joined the Union of the United States in 1845, Texas militia units participated in the [[Mexican–American War]].

In 1861 Texas joined the other [[Confederate States]] in seceding from the [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]], and Texas militias played a role in the [[American Civil War]], until it ended in 1865. Texas militiamen joined [[Theodore Roosevelt]]'s [[Rough Riders]], a volunteer militia, and fought with him during the [[Spanish–American War]] in 1898. Some of the training of the Rough Riders took place in San Pedro Park, in the north central part of San Antonio near the present site of [[San Antonio College]]. When a muster of the Militia proposed to train there on April 19, 1994, they were threatened with arrest, even though the charter of San Pedro Park forbids exclusion of activities of that kind. This threat led to a change of the meeting site. Like many other American states, Texas maintains a recognized State Militia, the [[Texas State Guard]].

==Vietnam==
The [[Militia#Vietnam|Vietnam Militia]] (''Dân quân Tự vệ'') is a part of [[Vietnam People's Armed Forces]]. The militia organized in communes, wards and townships and are put under commune-level military commands.

Vietnam Militia has two branches: Special Militia (nòng cốt) and General Militia (rộng rãi). The term of service in the core militia is 4 years.<ref>[http://moj.gov.vn/vbpq/en/Lists/Vn%20bn%20php%20lut/View_Detail.aspx?ItemID=10474 Law no. 43/2009/QH12 on Militia and Self Defense Forces]</ref>

==SFR Yugoslavia==
{{Main|Territorial Defense Forces (Yugoslavia)}}

Beside the federal [[Yugoslav People's Army]], each [[Country|constituent republic]] of the former [[SFR Yugoslavia]] had its own ''[[Territorial Defense Forces (Yugoslavia)|Territorial Defense Forces]]''. The [[Non-Aligned Movement|Non-Aligned]] Yugoslavia was concerned about an eventual aggression from any of the [[superpower]]s, especially by the [[Warsaw Pact]] after the [[Prague Spring]], so the ''Territorial Defense Forces'' were formed as an integral part of the [[total war]] [[military doctrine]] called ''Total National Defense''. Those forces corresponded to [[military reserve force]]s, [[paramilitary]] or militia, the latter, in the military meaning of the term (like [[military formation]]). It should not be confused with the Yugoslav Militia- ''[[Milicija]]'' which was a term for a [[police]].

==Civic duty==
The Militia Information Service (MIS), an [[Australia]]n not-for-profit organization, asserts that membership in the militia is a civic duty that helps to deter crime, tyranny, and [[crimes against humanity]] like [[genocide]]. The MIS urges all competent, law-abiding adults to "obtain a military type rifle and pistol like those commonly used by soldiers in their nation's armed forces and use them regularly (target shooting, hunting, etc.) in order to become proficient with them."<ref>{{cite web| title=Militia Information Service| work=| publisher=| year=| url=http://www.militia.info/facts.html| accessdate=2015-04-01}}</ref>
